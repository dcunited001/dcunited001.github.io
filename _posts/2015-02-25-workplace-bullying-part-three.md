I hope to share what has happened to me and around me, so that other's
can identify it and protect themselves from negative behavior.  I need
to vent a little bit because rumination is unhealthy.  I hope to get
this off my chest and *never need to think about it again.* I'm
serious.  The situations I've gone through are downright poisonous. I
am still suffering.

Some "tactics" I describe didn't happen to me personally.  Some of
these are situations that I've experienced, but some of them I've seen
friends go through.  Half of what I'm talking about didn't occur to me
in the workplace.  It happened in Jamskating, where things were
incredibly competitive, as that's the nature of the entertainment
industry.

I'm not trying to bring retaliation against a former colleague or
business.  If there are identifying details in here, I'm sorry.
That's not my intention.  Any details I provide I will attempt to keep
vague.  However, because it is vague, I'm at risk of seeming
passive-aggressive myself -- or worse, possibly making someone who is
not at fault feel responsible for something that happened.  If you
find yourself wondering whether you were involved in an example in one
of the following sections, that means you probably weren't.

Also, this is my experience from my perspective.  One of the worst
aspects of passive aggressive behavior -- and one reason that it is so
effective -- is that positive behavior becomes easy to confuse with
negative behavior, since the goal is to confuse cause and effect, to
encourage inaction and to prevent interference.

## Specific Tactics of Workplace Bullies

The worst part about these tactics is their indirectness.

### &#x2605; Hall of Mirrors

![Enter the Dragon - Hall of Mirrors](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/enter-the-dragon.jpg)

The bully may utilize suggestion and rhetoric to make "copies" of
himself and his beliefs.  They may bring in new people and poison them
against you.

This is really an advanced tactic, only possible once someone has
plenty of control in an environment.  Additionally, the environment
needs to be large enough to support this.  You're not going to see
this happen in a small or medium size business.  If someone has the
power required to attain this, you've already lost.  There's basically
nothing you can do.  In order to fight it, you're going to need untold
training in metaphysical jujitsu.

![Toungue Fu](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/toungue-fu.jpg)

#### You practice Qi Gong and Toungue Fu, my homies?

### &#x2605; Spread Rumors

The bully may acquire information about you in order to spread
believeable rumors.  You may spend years fighting these rumors.  You
may not even know that people believe these things about you -- in
fact, you probably won't.  The bullies will spend considerable effort
crafting rumors in such a way that no one will verify the truth.

They will work through catspaws to spread these rumors and you will
not know who started them, if you ever hear about them.  Sometimes, a
bully will pick out the worst possible things, a rumor so nasty that
no one will verify it for themselves.

### &#x2605; Abuse Confirmation Bias when Speading Rumors

When the bully spreads a rumor, they may couple this by suggesting a
method to test you with.  "Oh.. just ask him this or mention that.
See how he responds and you'll see its true."  By doing this and
constructing the rumors in just the right way, people will form
concrete beliefs about you that are not true.  And once enough people
form these beliefs, they are nearly impossible to shake.  These ideas
will acquire an *[egregore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore)*, a
will of their own.  Most people won't ask you things directly, so it
becomes difficult to dispel them.

By coming up with clever ways of abusing confirmation bias, it
increases the likelihood that these rumors will stick.  It's magical
-- people will test these rumors and then feel confident they just
outed you on something, when you really have no idea what's going on.
Or eventually, you wonder way sooo many people that you just met keep
asking about X, Y, or Z, which are not topics which normally come up
in conversation!  But it's like always the third topic someone pursues
in their first conversation with you.  At this point, your anxiety
becomes the confirmation bias -- your anxiety and nervousness about
the subject confirms it in this persons mind!  .... $#@!'ed up, ain't
it?

![Sperading Rumors](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/spreading-rumors.jpg)

> sex addict.  racist.  crackhead.  neonazi.  bipolar.  schizo.  HIV.
> antisocial.  heroin addict.  terrorist.  wife beater.  homewrecker.
> stalker.

Watches porn? Make sure everyone thinks they're a "creeper" whatever
that means.  Whats the wierdest fetish you can think of? They're into
it.  Paint sex as the primary motivation behind this person's
interactions with people.  Again, no one will actually verify it -- no
one will even get close to this person.  This is how lives are ruined,
folks.

### &#x2605; Construct a Lie by Rearranging Elements of the Truth

This is another particularly useful tool in creating rumors and
suggesting methods of confirmation bias.  This involves **Category
Theory**, by the way.  Beware people who are especially proficient at
this.  If it concerns a lie that's in the form of rearranged truth,
then people will try to verify pieces of the truth that compose the
lie.  When they verify enough pieces of truth, they will assume that
it is true in its entireity.

This technique is similar to the method used by some rock artists to
write songs.  They basically pick lyrics, words and concepts that
resonate with people then chop them up and rearrange them. People will
spend decades trying to decide what they mean, when they never really
meant anything at all, in and of themselves anyways.  The songs and
lyrics will begin to acquire meaning though.  Incredibly useful tool
for artists.

### &#x2605; Pick a Weak Target

A bully doesn't want to pick a fight they're going to lose do they?

![Don't Feed the Troll](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/dont-feed-the-troll.png)

### &#x2605; Identify the Target's Strongest Connections and Sever Them

The bully will find someone who is socially isolated to begin with.
And the bully will attack that person by attacking their strong social
connections in that environment.  By doing this, the people who would
stand up for that person no longer will.  This is especially effective
if that person has a developmental disorder making it hard for them to
establish relationships in the first place!!

### &#x2605; Blocking Moves, Like Those in Chess

The bully may attempt to prevent you from acquiring new relationships
by blocking you.  This can be physical, like blocking you from
entering a conversation by forming a tighter circle or turning their
back.

![Chess, Forever Alone Edition](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/chess-forever-alone.png)

#### The Chess Companion, Forever Alone Edition

They can also identify the people you are trying to acquaint yourself
with to try to preemptively establish a stronger relationship with
them.  Then, a manipulative person is capable of poisoning them
against you before you have a chance.

### &#x2605; Attach Labels to You

Already discussed this at length, but this bully will try to attach
labels to you.  They may feel out their social environment to
determine which labels are the most effective to apply to you.

### &#x2605; Disarm You with Kindness

Awww, isn't that sweet.  They're being nice to you.  How can you even
be mad at them!  This is a particularly effective tool in the bully's
arsenal:
[reversal of blame to the victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming).
It also happens to be something good people try to do in order to
reconcile differences.  Ahhh, plausible deniability.  There it is
again.  Be careful!  Definitely don't react negatively to someone
being nice to you.

### &#x2605; Have You Ever Tried Suggestion?

This is another tool.  You should try it sometime.  Just mention it to
someone.  You don't even have to mention it directly.  Just bring it
up in conversation a few times.  And then be amazed when something
relevant to the topic of suggestion happens to the person.

Oh, and anyone that attacks a bully for using suggestion is dumb.
I've never made that mistake, but I'm pretty sure you'll be labelled
as paranoid.  This is why it's particularly effective: you can't even
be blamed for doing it.

### &#x2605; Playing Dumb

> What?  I don't even know what that means?  How could I even use
> suggestion?  I don't even know what that is.  Yes, I studied
> psychology in college.  What do you mean it's impossible that I
> don't know what that is.  You're paranoid.

Playing dumb is particularly effective.  And I've been burned badly
for it in the past.  When i was in my early twenties, I just assumed
that everyone tried as hard as they could at everything.  I was
completely unaware of the snake in the grass that is "playing dumb."
That snake will !@#$'ing bite you.  Don't pick it up.

Of course, there are different kinds of "playing dumb."  There is the
person who plays dumb from the get-go in order to lull you into a
sense of security from which they can take advantage of you.  Carnies
do this and some street kids do this.  Homeless people also do this
.. homeless people aren't actually that dumb.  Regardless, if you fall
for this, you may find yourself quickly in a sticky situation.  It's
best to just look past it when you notice it.

There's another kind of playing dumb, which is more of a brief
response to other behavior.  Sometimes it's better off to not
broadcast everything you know, especially to those who are trying to
take advantage of you.

### &#x2605; Fool's Errands

> *"'ello good sir.  'ave you ever heard of the key to the midway?* Me and the ole' manager 'ave been looking for it all day and can't find it anywhere.  You wouldn't happen to know where it is, would you?  You'd be practically declared a hero if you did.  Well, off ya' go then.  Find that [key to the midway](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/key_to_the_midway), ya bloody sucka!"

This is a trick that's easy to fall for.  I once literally had a
coworker ask me if I knew what the Key to the Midway was, when I had
been working there for less than a week!  I was promptly sent on a
fool's errand -- or so he thought!  Turns out, it was a task that this
guy couldn't figure out and thought it'd be impossible for me.  It
quickly proved my worth to him, but I was lucky.  This guy ended up
being pretty cool though.

Always verify your tasks with your manager.  Listen to and trust your
coworkers, but be aware of what your manager asked you to do and
you'll be less likely to fall for this.  And if it's your manager
that's sending you on fool's errands, *well that's
**Mismanagement!** * Not much you can do.  You're probably about to
get fired.  Good luck with that.  Oh, and if you circle around to your
manager's manager, you're just going to piss your manager off. *
**GLHF!** *

![Key to the Midway](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/carnie-luv.jpg)

#### This guy wants you to find the Key to the Midway, so he can keep sitting on his ass.

The best fool's errand a workplace bully will employs involve a
considerable redirection of your time and energy.  Don't go startin'
new projects by yourself and don't go chasing waterfalls either.

### &#x2605; Bad Advice

Bullies in the workplace will give you bad advice and frame it as
words of wisdom.  They're just trying to put you down the wrong path.
Don't get me wrong, I love good advice.  But, there is such a thing as
bad advice.  Take what others have to say with a grain of salt, to say
the least.

> "Just.Be.Yourself." -- David Conner ... oh shit, that shoudn't be in
> the 'Bad Advice' section.

### &#x2605; Distorting Your Social Model

This is a particularly effective form of bad advice.  Everyone has a
social model, but the problem is that some of these social models just
plain suck.  If you don't have a great social model and you know you
need to improve, you may seek out help in the friends around you.
Turns out, some of these "friends" aren't friends at all.  *WATCH
OUT!* If they determine what you use to functionally optimize your
behavior, they can offer you advice that deeply changes how you
interact with people.

Some people are particularly effective at this -- somehow; I don't get
it -- beware these people.  If someone offers you advice that **(1)
you know to be false** and **(2) you know they should know to be
false**, then you're allowed to play dumb here.  This is not a good
person -- in fact, this is a very bad person.  Play dumb and discover
what else they'd like you to know =]

Be careful though.  Most people aren't manipulative.  You may be
making a mistake in misjudging this person.  Always keep that in mind,
as well.  But also watch for people who seem to try to make you
self-conscious.

### &#x2605; Setting the Frame

> "NEVER frame art!  Do NOT frame this piece!" -- Said every good
> artist I have ever bought art from.

Though I didn't understand at the time, now I do.  Setting the frame
of something -- a piece of art or a person's reputation & statements
-- limits the possibilities!  This is the subject of another post that
I'm going to write.

I hate this.  I fucking hate this.  I'm not the most articulate,
eloquent speaker.  And sometimes, the things I say can be
misinterpreted.  However, **each workplace bully** that I've worked
with has **sought to misinterpret what I've said in group settings.**
*Manipulative people are very, very good at discovering double
meanings -- **they have to be, to discover situations where plausible
deniability can be applied!!** *

In some cases, I would try to explain something: an idea, a
well-meaning critique on something.  In nearly every case, it was
something that should have been interpreted properly, but may have
needed more explaining.  The workplace bully would discover ways he
could intentionally misinterpret what I had to say and then twist it
around.  What usually results is that everyone else becomes confused
-- did he really mean *that*?  After this happens like 15 times, can
you really say it's a coincidence?!?

In my case, as I'm a fairly quiet person, I would have to stand up for
myself and correct this person.  But you're lucky if someone sets the
frame of conversation around you.  They may set the frame before
you're introduced to the conversation.  The frame of conversation is
difficult to describe, but it basically describes everyone's shared
context behind a conversation.

> Moral of the story: watch your !#@$'ing back around these people.

### &#x2605; Pavlov's Cute Puppy

[Pavlog's Dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) is
an old experiment, where the dogs were conditioned to expect food at
the chime of a bell.  The association with the chime of the bell
became so strong, it caused the dogs to salivate without the presence
of food.

My point is: in each instance, a workplace bully has *almost seemed
trained in psychology!* And they abused it, which is really, really
fucked up!  Also, if you're completely unaware of psychology, you'll
be caught off guard when it's used against you.

Pavlov's dog is useful to someone who wants to create signals used to
indicate threats or other messages.  It's hard to understand how
someone could use this against someone, but trust me -- it happens.
Don't be surprised when this and other tools of psychology are used
against you.

### Here's some cute puppies.

This article is a bit depressing.  It doesn't get any better.  You
deserve a break.  Watch this cute puppy compilation.

### &#x2605; You've Been Rorshocked!

This is another one related to psychology.  I've noticed that these
people will do something I call "rorshocking." That's intentionally
misspelled by the way.  This means that they show you something or
make a statement, in an attempt to make a judgement from your
reaction.  Lots of people do this, by the way -- sometimes it really
is a good way to elicit someone's beliefs.  However, in my case, a lot
of people have made grievous misjudgements based on my reactions.
Usually, you'll find people do this when they don't want to overtly
ask you something.

![Rorshock](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/rorshock.jpg)

And you'll find that workplace bullies will create certain scenerio's
in an attempt to elicit a certain reaction to them.  And then publicly
misconstrue your reaction in an attempt to whittle away at your
reputation.  It doesn't matter whether you give them the reaction that
they want, sociopathic people excel in contorting other's words and
actions.

### &#x2605; Create Juicy Soundbytes to Misquote You

Often, they will create contrived situations to get you to say
something they'll misuse to

> "Oh yeh and she said wants us to run a train on her. Are you down
> for that?" - My 'friend' says, on the way to the hotel.  We're alone
> in his car and halfway there.
>
> "..... . .  yeh... . . ???" - I reply, feigning agreement, unsure of
>what to say in such an awkward situation. I would never want to do
>something like that, of course.
>
> Later, at the hotel, while I'm not around:
>
> "Yeh and on the ride over to the hotel, he said he wanted to run a
> train on her." - My 'friend' misquoting an awkward statement where I
> never used those words.

Classy, right?  Gotta love jamskaters.

Of course, this is one scenario that no one will ever actually ask you
directly to verify.  *No one's going to want to ask anyone about
that.* In this particular example, I'm unsure whether I was actually
misquoted here.  But why did my 'friend' who I had known for ten
years, ask me this in the first place?  Shouldn't a friend know me
well enough to not ask me that?  Or could it be that he wanted to
neutralize me because he wanted the girl?

However, I can say with certainty that I have been misquoted behind my
back in other situations.  This includes a few situations that
happened at work, where if someone didn't ask to verify with me, they
would have been left with a completely invalid impression.  If your
"friends" create situations where they coerce you to make statements
like this, just to misquote you around your back, can you really say
that they're your friends?  Like if you're going to misquote someone
like that, **JUST FUCKING LIE**.  Just make some shit up.  Pull it out
of your own ass because I don't want you pulling it out of mine.

### &#x2605; Use Your Religion & Politics Against You

This has already been covered, but you need to be aware -- there are
really good reasons to leave politics and religion at home.  You may
be well meaning.  You may not even intentionally reveal this
information.  But don't be surprised when it gets used against you.
You may find that a bully will identify people on the opposite side of
politics/religion and pit you against them.

And IMO, this is really sad.  Why should it be a problem to talk about
who we are?

### &#x2605; Fear Mongering

This person will spread anxieties around the office about certain
aspects of your performance.  Whatever is negative and can be used,
they will spread.  They will seek to hide your victories and triumphs,
but will spread whatever fears can be used.

### &#x2605; Souring and Exhausting Your Relationships

These people may seek to make you unnecessarily overuse your
relationships with other people, until they are exhausted.  They might
try to keep you busy, so you are unable to perform favors with those
around you.  You may find yourself incredibly busy and required to ask
for favors from other people.

There is a give & take to life.  If for some reason, you're required
to overtake from those around you or if you just ask for help all the
time, people are going to be less likely to help you when you need it.

### &#x2605; Good Cop, Bad Cop

This is a particularly effective strategy and it requires a certain
level of complicity.  Basically, one person acts like your friend and
the other puts a lot of pressure on you.  The Good Cop is acquiring
information about how you feel about the Bad Cop.

![Good Cop Bad Cop](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/good-cop-bad-cop.png)

#### Wow, that looks horrendously effective.

This is actually a tactic that's used in business fairly often and so,
it really doesn't indicate a bully.

### &#x2605; Attaching Pyschological Labels to You

The bully may try to apply psychological labels to you.  This can be
particularly effective, as oftentimes with mental disorders, the way
people react to the label can be more devastating than the disease
itself.  For example, if someone repeatedly calls you paranoid, people
around you may mistake this for paranoid schizophrenic.  Or they may
not label you with anything specific: they might just insinuate that
you're crazy in one way or another.  But if you're labelled as
paranoid, you're probably not going to be taken seriously anytime
soon.  Sometimes, people just throw labels out there to see what
sticks.  It's incredibly unsettling.

### &#x2605; Labelling You as Paranoid -- Extremely Effective

Because intentions are concealed and sociopaths thrive on plausible
deniability & duplicity -- then, when dealing with passive aggressive
behavior, one can easily become paranoid.  And that's often one goal:
make your opponent seem paranoid.  And once others concur, well then,
now you have carte blanche to do pretty much anything -- and your
opponent is never able to publicly second-guess your motivations.  If
they do, you can easily bust out the "paranoid" card.

By the way, **interpreting motivations behind behavior** and
**determining correlated reactions & behaviors** are two of the most
powerful things you can do in life.  If you are not allowed to do
these things, you will never succeed in any significant way.

> You Must Determine Correlated Behavior!!

What do I mean by that?  You need to not only identify when someone's
behavior is functionally coupled to your own, but how their behavior
and reactions are related to your own.  There are many ways of doing
this, but you can only learn to do this from experience.  You have to
experiment and test to see how someone reacts to you, but beware of
confirmation bias.

Any "test" you give them can be manipulated.  Or worse, you could
misconstrue the results.  The best way to "test" someone is not to
test them at all -- let life itself show you their true intentions.
When something crazy happens, where you and this person have chips in
the game, only then you'll see their true colors.

The CIA has the D.E.C. method -- Determine, Evade, Coerce. At least,
they do according to the TV show, Covert Affairs.  Pretty awesome TV
show though.

![Piper Perabo](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/piper-perabo.jpg)
#### Agent Annie Walker on Covert Affairs.  I'd put a ring on it LOL

Of course, your approach to discovering someone's motivations needs to
be balanced.  If you drive yourself to paranoia, then you will
prematurely end positive opportunities out of fear, which will drive
you to isolation.

Not everyone has sinister motivations -- in fact, most people are
truly good at heart.  They're innocent and they want to help those
around them.  This makes them useful to sociopathic people.  One
problem is that they can be poisoned against you, before you ever get
the chance to meet them.  They will act with behavior suggested to
them by your enemies.

### &#x2605; Create Lose-Lose Situations.

This person may consistently think ahead to place you into lose-lose
situations.  They'll put you in between a rock and a hard place, so to
speak.  Avoid being set up in this positions.  And when you find
yourself here, think quickly and creatively to find yourself a way out
of that box.  Don't rely on the choices presented to you.  Be
creative.

### &#x2605; Setting up a Fall Guy

This is more likely to occur in private life, which actually happened
to me once.  I found I was being accused of stealing a PS4 in a
legally airtight situation, where of course I was not guilty.  I had 3
minutes to put together a defense for myself between the time that my
roommate in Raleigh notified me of the situation -- via text message
-- and the time that he arrived at home.  Very very fucked up, IMO.

> At this point, if you're an attorney, you may be asking yourself
> "But, you live together.  If you two were alone at the apartment
> when it happened (discovered at 7:30am) then why would this person
> leave the apartment, 'go to class,' then notify you via text message
> at 8:30am, five minutes before they return...  If they discovered it
> before they left for class, then wouldn't they have mentioned it
> before they left for class?"

I'm not sure who did it and I hope it was not some conspired event.
All I know is that I literally woke up in a scary legally airtight
situation of which I had NO KNOWLEDGE -- the only people in my
apartment during that time were me and my roommate....  As my roommate
came home, I thought ahead and had an audio recording app ready and my
first words were "this conversation is being recorded."  I was
immediately accused of having stolen the PS4 -- with $2000 in the bank
at the time.  I believed that anyone who would steal a PS4 would not
want the situation public, so I immediately posted the audio recording
on Youtube & Facebook, publicly.  A really shitty legal defense, by
the way.  If a lawyer ever tells you do do something like this, fire
that lawyer.  And demand your retainer returned.

> "And that, children, is **why I bought a PS4!** Spite ... **I bought
> it out of *SPITE!* ** The very next week! That's when they released
> the white PS4.  I bought it because the PS4 which was stolen was
> black! :) :) I didn't even want it yet. LMAO"

![White PS4](/img/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three/white-ps4.jpg)

Most of the time, when someone commits petty theft, they already have
a plan in their mind as to who is going to be blamed.  Remember, they
have thought about how this is going to play out -- the victim in this
kind of situation has not.  In business, this can be a more serious
trap.  It can be used for more than assailing your reputation.  Watch
out for being set up as a fall guy for someone else's legal problems.

### &#x2605; Identify Your Vices and Use Them Against You

> "Recovering alcoholic?  Ten years sober?  Not any more!" -- Anonymous Sociopath

This can be possibly just distracting and possibly detrimental to your
life and reputation.  For example, you may find yourself in the
precarious situation of driving home drunk from a work outing.  Or
perhaps narcotics officers were tipped off that you have drugs on you.
Your walking home drunk from the bar.  You're alone and then you're
nabbed.  Not going to get much done at work when you have mounting
legal debts and not to mention all that "therapy" that the government
is nice enough to make you pay for, in time and money.

If someone have a drug problem, the bully will make sure everyone
knows.  The harder the drug, the better.  You'll lose so many
opportunities, you'll probably never recover.  Or maybe you'll never
make it anywhere in the first place and you won't have anything to
regain.

### &#x2605; A Bully Will Choose Their Audience Wisely

The bully won't want to seem cruel in front of others.  But, when you
are 1-on-1, they will likely let you know how they feel.

### &#x2605; Misrepresent Your Works/Actions to Others

This is similar to some of the content in "Setting the Frame."  But,
it's worth saying again: bullies and sociopaths are excellent at being
duplicitous and identifying similar situations that can be exploited.
You will find yourself surrounded and you won't get the chance to see
how your words and actions were misrepresented.  After all, this
person has carefully controlled visibility and chosen their audiences
wisely.  Politics.

### &#x2605; Channels of Communication are Exploited

The bully will take advantage of how information is disseminated.
This is similar to controlling visibility and audience, but altogether
different.  This person will reveal information in confidence to you
privately on 1-on-1 chat.  Then, simultaneously, on the group Google
Hangout, they will paint a different picture altogether, in front of
your coworkers.

And if you have High Functioning Autism, it may be extremely difficult
to identify that this is happening, while you have a chance to stop
it!  For example, at one company I worked for, there was a person who
offered to help me out.  He was giving me real advice in Flowdock, one
on one -- in private.  That's where he was giving me the real advice.
Everyone was on a Google Hangout at the same time.

In this Google Hangout, he was painting me as being completely
incompetent by making statements to lead others to think I had no idea
what certain standard tools were.  In the Google Hangout, I played
dumb for a second when he asked me whether or not I knew what **Chrome
Developer Tools** were ... If you're a Web Developer and you don't
know what those are, you should be fired.  By playing dumb, I
identified that, yes, he was in fact trying to paint me as being
incompetent.

The problem about catching a liar or sociopath in the act is that,
while they may truly be plotting against you, if you don't have **the
smoking gun**, they will simply deny knowledge of it.  They're
extremely good at compartmentalizing their behavior.  Like I said,
they are only motivated by what others see.  The problem with my
situation above is that it's really vague and hard to explain to
others without sounding paranoid.

### &#x2605; They'll Keep You Busy Until You Experience Problems in Your Personal Life

A workplace bully may identify aspects of your personal life to use
against you.  They may stack you up for work or make you work in such
a way -- especially if it's your manager -- that makes it impossible
for you to deal with personal issues.  They may make you feel as
though you aren't accomplishing enough, so that you'll be hesitant to
take time off to deal with personal issues.

### &#x2605; Limiting Your Tools

> "Build me a goddamn bridge, David.  But, don't use a goddamn hammer
> or any fucking nails, David.  Or so help me God, I'll fire your lazy
> ass.  You're going to build me that goddamn bridge and you're going
> to use rope! Dammit David, do exactly what I tell you.  Your goddamn
> bridge fell apart.  What the fuck did I tell you about rope?"
>
> "But ... I spent 200 hours on that rope bridge.  I took me twenty
> times as long because I couldn't use a hammer."
>
> "Shut up, David.  SEE EVERYONE, watch what happens when you build
> shitty rope bridges.  YOUR FIRED!"


### &#x2605; Setting You Up For Failure

### &#x2605; Profile Their Victims

If someone is going to bully you and if they are good at it, they WILL
profile you.  They will ask you leading questions.  And they WILL ask
you about your age.  You can count on that.  Your age (if you are
young) reveals which pop culture references you do and do not know,
what technologies you know, etc, etc.  Sounds subtle, but trust me,
it's useful.

### &#x2605; Install Malware on Your Computer

A workplace bully is going to want to keep an eye on you.  There are
many examples of voice-to-text exploits online.  Another
software-specific example of shitty shit that shitty developers do,
but be aware of your words and actions around that laptop they gave
you.  It's impossible to say for sure, but there's a chance that
there's malware on it.

By listening in to your conversations, a workplace bully can identify
scenario's they are likely to get away with and they can gain
invaluable understanding behind your own actions as well.

### So that's it for Part Three

I split out this part from Part Two since it was getting too long.
I'm in the process of writing Part Four, the section containing tools
you can use to prevent this behavior from occuring in front of you.
This is definitely the most important part.  I wanted to include it
first, but it requires a lot of context to understand why this is
important.
