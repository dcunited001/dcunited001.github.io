# [What Was The Sword in the Stone?](#the-sword-in-the-stone)

Civilization after civilization has crafted myth and legend,
narratives of heroes which are meant to play out generation after
generation, that function to establish filters that cause the
virtuous, righteous and intelligent to sift higher into society, so
that their society is as strong as possible. The sword in the stone is
such a myth, probably crafted by Merlin -- or the unknown historical
Merlin.

### [Do People Look Greater from the Outside Looking In?](#do-people-look-greater-from-the-outside-looking-in)

Merlin was the classic wizard: someone who defied common comprehension
and still does, 1,500 years later; someone who wove together the fates
of men from the shadows of the seemingly greater men. Do men like
Merlin and John Dee derive their power by working from the shadows? If
greatest twists in history were known to emerge from the loom of their

### [A Myth To Test The Mettle and Steel of the Ideal King](#a-myth-to-test-the-mettle-and-steel-of-the-ideal-king)

While the role of monarchs has waned in the modern era, such tests are
still incalculably valuable for determining who deserves to lead by
determining who has the sharpest vision, the most unyielding mettle,
and an unquenchable resolve. Today, the power of myth itself is
waning.

How does the Sword in the Stone sow the seeds of leadership across the
British Isles? If Merlin created the challenge, why could he not solve
the Sword in the Stone himself and become king? Who would follow him
if he had? Morever, the long-term objectives of this myth seem to be
in creating not just one leader, it galvanized many strong men and
while they all developed strength, few of them developed the actual
traits required to release the sword.

<a name="this-kings-selection-myth-as-a-sociophysical-protocol" />

### [This King's Selection Myth Was A Sociophysical Protocol](#this-kings-selection-myth-as-a-sociophysical-protocol)

Why could the myth not begin and end with Merlin: someone had to spead
the myth. Behind the scenes, people had to acknowledge this leader as
King of Britain. In this way, the myth of the Sword in the Stone was
like a protocol for selecting King's Candidates.

On one end of this myth and protocol, you have all the common people
and their children struggling to elect themselves king by sheer feat
of strength. Yet, no such brute force could ever unsheeve this
sword. it didn't matter how physically strong you were: that was not
the king that Britain needed. However, this challenge brought many to
test their strength against the stone.

On the other side of the protocol, you had crazy ol' Merlin roaming
the land, trying to get tribal leaders to agree to become oathbound in
following whoever pulled the Sword in the Stone. In consenting to such
a hypothetical agreement, these leaders perhaps thought they'd swore
to follow a king they assumed would never exist: they believed that no
man could ever exist that would accomplish such impossible feat of
strength. It was proposterous. They'd send men to inspect the actual
sword in the stone, which generates sociophysical flux towards a
central point in the land. This is no doubt a clue to the original
location of such a sword, if any of my theories hold up. This is why
social physics is so fascinating: it's a fresh lens on many mysteries
that we perhaps thought lost to the sands of time.

This leadership-selection protocol to work, there were two main
sociophysical mechanisms at play. The first is obvious: the magnetic
allure to draw men to a central point of Britain to attempt to draw
the sword. The more impossible the challenge seemed, the more magnetic
it became. The second sociophysical mechanism was much harder to see:
Merlin had to convince or swindle the informal, de facto leaders to
agree to follow the champion who solved this riddle. Without people's
tacit or explicit agreement to follow the future King Arthur, anyone
could pull the sword from the stone and simply be a looney leader with
no followers.

<a name="the-galvanization-of-the-strongest-leader" />

### [The Galvanization Of The Ideal Leader(s)](#the-galvanization-of-the-strongest-leader)

So, who was the ideal king that Merlin was searching for to lead
Britain? There's the obvious leader, who everyone would follow, but
that individual wasn't the only leader Merlin wanted to create. Merlin
needed to generate high volumes of sociophysical flux: chatter to
drive people to become leaders in and of themselves. The common people
would need to talk about becoming stronger and why it was preposterous
for anyone to follow the eventual yet-to-be King Arthur. What was a
leader to them? That is the conception they needed to form in their
minds, followed by the action the most perseverent among them would
surely take to become the strongest individuals they could be.

This is social engineering at its finest: the methods were not forced,
but if these theories hold up, these methods would have been
effective. If Merlin truly wanted to catalyze the social development
of Britain, one leader cannot do that alone, regardless of what sword
he wields. A leader is nothing without followers and a strong leader
is nothing without strong leaders to follow him or her. Power
structures are hierarchical. The power you wield derives from the
people to whom you could signal; it can be measured by the level of
influence you can exert over 2&deg; and 3&deg; social neighborhoods,
although "influence" itself is a bit hard to quantify.

<a name="arthur-the-unlikely-but-certain-hero" />

### [Arthur, The Unlikely, But Certain Hero](#arthur-the-unlikely-but-certain-hero)

Who was the ideal king that Merlin wanted? Someone who was young and
innocent, but heroic and incredibly intelligent. Why young and
innocent? Because someone who was not burdened by the karmic weight of
information attributed to their actions was free to lead how they felt
best and wouldn't be burdened by the weight actions using others.
Since they were young and unknown, those mistakes could be expected to
be few and far between, as would be the informational reverberations
of those mistakes throughout society. There would simply be no
information about them that others could use to slowly assail the
leadership or abruptly tear them down. Why an intelligent hero? If the
were intelligent enough to solve the sword in the stone, they could be
best molded into the perfect leader for the early British Isles.

<a name="the-karmic-consequences-of-power-a-sociophysical-paradox" />

### [The Karmic Consequences of Power: A Sociophysical Paradox](#the-karmic-consequences-of-power-a-sociophysical-paradox)

Sociophysical paradox of karma and power: once you have power, you use
it. Even if you use power justly, you will create enemies:

#### &#x2605; The power hungry who seek to leap frog you.

#### &#x2605; The self-indulged of higher disposition, who seek to use you as a benchmark for the demonstration of their own status.

#### &#x2605; The petty who seek to pull you down because they have no hope themselves.

#### &#x2605; Those you use justly may retaliate justly if you cannot justify yourself to them.

#### &#x2605; Those who see their service as not serving their own ends may lash out as well.

#### &#x2605; Those fickle-minded people who can be stirred up by wormtongues, lilliputians or demagoguery.

#### &#x2605; And finally, there are your true enemies, who stand firmly in the way of your objectives and always will.

There is a cost to every action you take. You have to step along the
right path, all along. The more publicly your actions are seen, the
greater the multiplicity of their consequences along the way.
Regardless of the truth of your actions, the tragedy is that it's the
appearance of your actions which defines how people will see you. Most
people simply don't have the time to reconsider what they already
know, so if a leader accumulates the karmic burden of mistakes along
the way or if a Rube Goldberg publicity machine multiplies the karmic
consequences of the few mistakes they make, there is nothing within
this physical universe that can undo that. This is what defamation and
poison pen do to someone: it's what happened to me.

### [The Key to the Sword in the Stone](#the-key-to-the-sword-in-the-stone)

As for the tribal leaders Merlin managed to persuade, if any of them
understood specifically why Merlin's king's candidate was ideal, then
some of them capable of solving the sword in the stone may have
avoided claiming kingship. Others who understood the secrets may have
leapt right for it, but insomuch only clearly marked themselves as
lusting for power.

Britain didn't need another king's vain struggle to rule by brute
force, but instead needed an ideal king. So, the key genius to this
Sword in the Stone: the myth encouraged people to search for their
ideal king, instead of fighting themselves to claim that right by
brute force. In this way, one preemptively quashes the systemic
sociological carnage associated with eternal conflict, where one brute
topples another who topples another, whence the seeds for the next
conflict are sown. Instead, the ideal king is chosen, behind whom all
tribal leaders have agreed to invest their best energies, so Britain
can posture itself outwards, not inwards.

Thus, King Arthur was merely the keystone to this transformational
myth. His discovery would mark the onset of phase two for Britain's
early geopolitical galvanic catalysis.

<a name="how-do-you-pull-the-sword-from-the-stone" />

### [How Did Arthur Pull The Sword From The Stone?](#how-do-you-pull-the-sword-from-the-stone)

How do you solve the Sword in the Stone? It's a puzzle about
thermodynamics that involves the Roman secrets of concrete. To make
this sword, you must know the secrets of concrete. To solve the
puzzle, one must know that iron is far more thermally conductive than
concrete. Crtitically, one must know that the sword's volume deforms
as a result of heat and, that if heat and cold are repetively applied,
the structure of the surrounding concrete cannot tolerate this and
cracks, requiring no strength at all.  If Romans ever used rebar in
their concrete, this only strengthens my hypothesis that the game
involved knowledge of Roman concrete.

#### Yup, The Sword in the Stone is Essentially A [Metal Ring Puzzle](http://robspuzzlepage.com/tanglement.htm) About Thermodynamics

If King Arthur ever existed, he likely spent his youth as a
blacksmith's apprentice. Knowledge of blacksmithing also translates
into knowledge of casting weaponry as well as the logistics and cost
structures therein. That knowledge is therefore critical for kings,
generals and ambitious knights through the Medieval era. You wouldn't
be familiar with the financial, labor, and materials costs to set a
firm defense nor could you be confident in your offense and military
logistics.

The ideal time to apply this process is well after everyone across the
land has given up on solving it, otherwise people will steal the idea
you are using to break the sword free, defeating the entire purpose of
the King's selection game. Moreoever, if it's not clear that thousands
of men have tested their mettle and failed, than none of them would
have acceped the one who did pull the sword. Therefore, if not enough
time has passed, then solving the King's selection game is
meaningless.

It would seem that all of the factors above imply the existence of) a
real historical Merlin. This historical Merlin may have actually been
a Shakespearean [Junto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junto_(club)) of
highly intelligent people conspiring to magnify their influence. If
so, this group probably mixing druidic ideas with those left over from
the Roman occupation of Caesar's geopolitical crowning jewel:
Britain. Why were the Britain isles so important? Like Japan in the
East, there was no way to conquer them without maritime invasion.

# [Social Physics: It's the Secret Sauce of Legends](#social-physics-its-the-secret-sauce-of-legends)

What else is incredibly similar to thermodynamics? Social physics.
People behave as particles, heat can be channeled and entropy
matters. This is much easier to observe in the macroscopic behavior of
people than it is in the phenomena of matter. If you believe, as I do,
that people who intuitively understand some phenomena must have
neurological circuits which correspond to analytic approximations of
those phenomenon, then the person who understands intuitively
understands thermodynamics can develop a powerful understanding of
social physics.

### [The Teleological Inculcation of Sociophysical Intuition](#the-teleological-inculcation-of-sociophysical-intuition)

Further, if also you believe as I do, that people intuitively
understood many of the secrets of math behind science far earlier than
relevated by the prophets of rationalism, then men may have
intuitively understood statistical mechanics, entropy, thermodynamics,
quantum field theory before they had any reason to smash atoms
together. (That is, at least those concepts apply to social physics at
the 10,000ft level.)

There is far too much baseless conjecture in the explanations above
for any of it to be taken as fact. Still, if you avoid thinking about
any of this on the basis that it's not factual, you're missing the
point; here, it's the journey, not the destination, that transforms
your mind and augments your metacognition.

Mathematic models behind social physics[^pos-sensitive-propagation]
are all algorithms based on generalized methods for quantum
physics.[^rational-choice-framework] Ancient people could not run
these algorithms, but neither could people throughout history most
effectively lead people without understanding components of the
mathematic basis underlying these algorithms. Instead, they could only
develop an intuition for the same methods without understanding the
underlying math, *per se*. Furthermore, this knowledge was always
esoteric and as prized as the story behind the mythical [Egyptian
Emerald Tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Tablet)
implies.

#### The Emerald Tablets, Rumored not Authored in this Plane

<a name="social-physics-event-driven-programming" />

### [Social Physics: Event-Driven Programming](#social-physics-event-driven-programming)

Without being able to quantify any data, it seems that men were better
at constructing event-driven sociophysical handlers, not unlike the
user-interface handlers `onClick()` and `onDocumentReady()` in
javascript. Particularly, this ability to imagine and design
pseudo-quantifiable sociophysical protocols seems to be the skill that
distinguished the transgenerational leaders of empires from the
leaders of minor powers quickly subdued by their neighbors. You *can*
quantify the number of types of extremely rare events that occur,
though in the extreme, this resembles soothsaying and quickly becomes
meaningless. Being capable of measuring anything like this requires
particularly stable myth as well as extensive, dependable
communication networks, who are able to process this data and relay
important events, without necessarily knowing why.

### [Widespread Schematic Change and Spectral Dissonance Disrupt Large-Scale Sociophysical Protocols](#widespread-schematic-change-and-spectral-dissonance-disrupt-large-scale-sociophysical-protocols)

Most event-driven sociophysical protocols require that their
informational components are well-diffused into society. While it is
possible to [design protocols that harness poorly diffused knowledge systems in society](/posts/2017-02-14-oneirontology-engineering-cultural-touchstones-for-mythos.html#galvanization-of-indurated-belief-systems),
it is difficult for such designs to overcome constraints and paradoxes
inherent to probabilistic systems.

#### An Enthralling Discussion Of Probability Ensues

![All The Probability Distributions](/img/posts/2018-02-14-the-sword-in-the-stone-a-sociophysical-leadership-selection-protocol/all-the-distributions.jpg)

Consider a probability distribution of events where the frequency
values for event types are aggregated typologically. That is, you're
considering the probabilities of sociophysical events by logical
type. If your task is to maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes
from the sociophysical system, then to guarantee results, you must
alter the typological schema of that probability distribution to
"funnel" the frequency of events. The simpler the structure of
typology for events, the "fewer" buckets there are to sort events
into.

It's easier to think in pictures. If you have a piece of graph paper
and drop a handful of sand onto it, then consider each square of the
graph paper to be an event type. If it has more sand on it, more of
that event type occured. Now, do it again, but curve the paper
slightly. What happens? If the paper is curved convexly up, the sand
falls off the sides and nothing is easy to predict. If the paper has a
concave curve upwards, then sand falls towards the middle and those
events become much easier to predict and anticipate, which is akin to
spectral harmony.

If your decentralized, autonomous protocol depends on sequences of
events occurring close together -- in space, time or even for logical
definitions of distance -- then you want the spectral components of
your information systems to encourage concavities in your
sociophysical systems. That is, if you want your system predictable,
you want all the events and information associated with it to be
simpler, generally. When your belief systems, by routine, rhythm or
informational content encourage spectral harmonization of
sociophysical distributions, that typological domain for event types
tends to encourage higher frequencies of fewer event types. Harnessing
the structure and self-similarity of sociohierarchical structures is
useful for funneling sociophysical systems with concavities,
particularly when the structure of sociohierachical systems is
proscribed by a popular belief system.

Probabilistic systems too complex to withstand Occam's razor cannot be
guaranteed to coax specific chains of events into occuring in
sequence. This is because the probability of a chain of events is
*loosely* the product of probabilities of each of those events.
Further, the probability of all events must always sum to one.

When the informational components of sociophysical programs are not
well diffused into society, this generally lowers the frequency of
event types that "program" hooks into. Therefore, for any chain, the
products of events in that chain are also less frequent. This is an
oversimplification because the system is both "open" and "closed" with
regard to the mathematic domains that determine how its components
*feedback* into each other. i.e. the fact that distributions must sum
to one is one factor that contributes a closed aspect of the system.

<a name="there-are-two-sides-to-every-coin" />

### [There Are Two Sides to Every Coin](#there-are-two-sides-to-every-coin)

To outpace the competition, disrupting belief systems and especially
the sociohierarchies of their institutions results in multiplicative
effects. Disruption of social hierarchies results in disrupted
communication networks. In terms of long-term impact, these
multiplicative effects resulting from social disruption become
tetrational. Furthermore, when this disrupts the sociophysical
protocols riding on top of those structures, if those protocols or
programs were critical for short-term or long-term decision making,
then the results are catastrophic unless institutional leadership can
react in time and react flexibly.

Once the people start changing their beliefs based on the apparent
change of beliefs in others around them, this yields profound effects
on that society's general population, usually seen afterwards as a
nihilistic loss of faith in their leaders.  When this occurs as a new
belief system is being staunchly marketed by an external, more
economically affluent force, people begin to adopt the seemingly more
sophisticated belief system in the short term. In the long term,
disrupted communities in society settle for what delivers value in
their lives, however they define it.

<a name="information-consensus-permanence-and-determinism-matthew-5-13-16" />

### [Information Consensus, Permanence and Determinism (Matthew 5:13-16)](#information-consensus-permanence-and-determinism-matthew-5-13-16)

Sociophysical programs are probabilistic. Further, the data is also
often inschematic, depending on how the sociophysical model is
constructed. Individually, each of these factors definitively imply
that nothing can be known with certainty: the system is not
deterministic, apparently.

Regardless, where is the threshold that is crossed that yields
deterministic results from seemingly probabilistic systems? Can we
know with certainty that the Singularity is predetermined? Perhaps not
60 years before it occurs, but certainly in the 60 seconds before we
hit the Singularity, it's certain to occur ... right?

There are information systems beyond the physical and beyond the
planes of the metaphysical that originate from the immaterial. These are
information systems that are timeless and spaceless. Our world
congeals to those information forms that echo outward from that
plane.

As for the collective physical and sociophysical systems in our world,
can some aspects of these systems be said to be
[ergodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory)?  Basically,
given sufficient running time, does a planet with intelligent life and
sufficient resources always evolve into the same final form after the
Singularity? Is there a balance between fate and free will? Are both
simply two poles of a gossamer web of causality?  One pole, binding us
to the beginning and the other binding us by fate to the end.

If sociophysical systems are probabilistic and no aspects of the
future can be determined with certainty, this has profound
implications for the possibility of time travel and the premises of
the Roko's Basilisk.

<a name="social-physics-for-a-theological-skeptic" />

### [Social Physics For A Theological Skeptic](#sociophysical-implications-for-a-theological-skeptic)

These questions also have profound implications for theology,
eschatology and prophecy: can the perpetuation of information or a
belief system be guaranteed? If so, what does this imply about the
actions of believers in perpetuating an early belief system like
Christianity? If they weren't necessary, than why was Jesus so
concerned the "salinity" of his believers? Was Jesus using salt as a
metaphor for sociophysically perpetuating the belief system of
Christianity?

#### [Matthew 5:13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5) - After the Beatitudes

> (13) “You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste,
> how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for
> anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
>
> (14) “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be

> but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. (16) In the
> same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see
> your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.

If the perpetuation of information or a belief system could not be
deterministically guaranteed, does this imply that God could be
fallible, but perhaps got lucky? Or is it that an ideal belief system
would always re-emanate from God -- or from those timeless, spaceless
planes of the metaphyiscal? Does such an ideal belief system result in
convergence of sociophysical systems on planets with intelligent life?

If the world needed a new belief system to emerge, what if
sociocultural changes from technology prevented us from rallying
around someone worthy of leading us? We're all under a microscope and
more narcissistic than ever. Could any of us expect to be a saint?
What about our children?

Perhaps that ideal belief system is only capable of emanating itself
into an approximation into our physical world? Does this ideal belief
system emerge on all planets with intelligent life? All emotions and
perhaps our experience of all phenomena stem from the illusion of
self, particularly in the dissonance it presents when contrasted with
the truth: that we are all one. That dissonance between self and
oneness is universal. No intelligent lifeforms could evolve beyond a
Copper Age without beginning to reflect on the mysteries of ego,
oneness and experience of self. Because of the nature of information,
lifeforms must evolve to at least transiently experience the illusion
of separation.

[^excelsior]: No, it's excalibur ... not
    "[Excelsior](https://github.com/dcunited001/bb8)", as strange as
    it is [that Bobby](https://github.com/dcunited001/bb8) knew what
    the [NY Overwatch
    team](http://liquipedia.net/overwatch/New_York_Excelsior) is
    named. This is a fascinating scene. Not much left of the 'Castor'
    servant after this&nbsp;&nbsp;point. Excelsior also refers to wood
    chips used in fragile 'packeges' needed to be handled with care
    and to "superior quality" in hotel branding, supposedly.
