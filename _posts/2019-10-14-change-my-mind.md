this knowledge over time, by learning to weave ideas and their

- marxism was a product of the middle of the industrial revolution and
  shouldn't have established itself as it's own raison d'etre. it put
  too much faith in structuralism before #ComplexityTheory was fully
  developed: it didn't adapt to the problems of combinatorial
  expansion that render structuralist approaches to social engineering
  impossible.

- and that's without getting into it's economic problems, which
  require a pyramid-scheme of an empire in order to sustain the
  growth/control that Marxism requires to deliver on it's promises to
  workers.at the same time, Marxism brutally criticizes imperialism.

- to most people, even psychologists/psychiatrists, this would seem
  to fit the definition of word salad. BUT IT'S NOT. every word and
  sentence is layered with concentrated meaning. it's genius

- there are individual sentences in that essay i linked i could spend
  more than 30 minutes or an hour unpacking and explaining. most
  paragraphs, i could spend 15-30 minutes unpacking & explaining,
  especially to someone who doesn't understand cybernetic theory
  applied to social systems. that's not because it's meaningless. it's
  because it's full of meaning.

==========

- crossing structuralism with complexity theory could be seen in the
  analysis of complexity of either data structures or language usage
  in Computational Linguistics. from the philosophical perspective,
  structuralism is a bit deeper than simply structure in language, but
  its ideas can be seen in machine learning translation algorithms,
  particularly the Transformer algorithm, which uses an interlingual
  representation that improves its accuracy as it learns more
  languages. its representation effectively encodes meaning to a web
  of associated concepts.

- for an idea of what I mean, there's a high-level explanation of what
  does at the 3:00 minute mark in this
  video. [Transformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEljKc9ZtU8)

- now i just need a second to bridge the gap to Marxism, which
  technically preceded structuralism by 100 years, but seems to have
  foreseen it or would inevitably become reliant on its theories. why?
  to harmonize culture with Marxist theory/implementation and to
  manage language/culture as a framework social & economic
  relationships b/w groups, among other needs.

- **after every significant communist revolution (Bolshevik & Maoist),
  there were **major reforms** in #Orthography, in literature, in
  distribution/publication of written information and in language
  generally. deciding how to implement the rearchitecture of language
  from pre-revolution to post-cultural-revolution wasn't something
  decided overnight.

- every communist revolution is bloody and its operatives/supporters
  need to build something of a new language (a cryptolect, argot, or
  cant) in order to lull the Bourgeoisie into falling asleep at the
  wheel. this is where the beginnings of large-scale cultural change
  are sown. it is not enough to displace the existing elite because
  they are powerful. during revolution, bourgeoisie sympathizers are
  targeted & marked. they don't know the cryptolect or don't truly see
  the same vision.

- the closer to the source of revolution someone is, the more familiar
  they should be with the vision that revolutionaries have for how
  culture will be afterwards. the cryptolect may simply be a pattern
  language, but it's deeply connected to this vision that the
  leadership has. familiarity with this vision at first builds hope,
  then serves to identify supporters to one another then harmonizes
  the supporters, then serves to identify people who "just don't get
  it" or are saboteurs, then it finally becomes a growing sense of
  validation post-revolution. BUT IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME PLANNED
  TRANSITION TO ORTHOGRAPHIC AND LINGUISTIC CHANGES.

- before and during the revolution, the party assesses its own for
  their degree of support, their conformity and their ability to
  advance the communist agenda. the party is also networking out into
  society to determine how and where it can advance: it needs to know
  what opposition will resist it & how, it needs to know how to
  subvert positions in society filled by bourgeoisie who will always
  resist, and it needs to shift the average person's normative
  assumptions -- especially insofar as what the average person
  believes the outcome will be. once it is normal to assume that most
  of the proletariat believes that revolution is inevitable **then the
  revolution can accelerate with very little friction**. most average
  people will just follow along, especially if they believe this next
  Robespierre is crazier than the last one.

- but the point is to identify potential #Reactionaries and lump
  together anyone who might join together with the former
  Bourgeoisie. and cultural revolution rips the rug right out from
  under the elite -- because they resist adopting the language reforms
  (who wouldn't), they mark themselves and their associates as they do
  so. their letters and papers identify their allegiance to the old
  order. their speech hasn't been upgraded to the next #Newspeak
  version. because the revolution is necessarily bloody, then anyone
  who is lumped in with the "reactionaries" is targeted for
  harrassment, imprisonment, death or #CorruptionOfBlood so that the
  Communists can begin to vet their own ranks for loyalty while using
  anyone too close to their enemies as #TargetPractice. BUT IT'S ALL
  CENTERED AROUND LANGUAGE

-  finally, as the cultural revolution subsides, it becomes clear that
   the Communists don't have the grasp they need on the economy to
   deliver on their promises to the people -- who have **NECESSARILY**
   sabotaged their economy into oblivion ALL TO DEPRIVE THE
   BOURGEOISIE OF WEALTH & POWER. Economic collapse isn't simply a
   tool for #Leninists to stir the poor and hungry into a frenzy, IT
   IS NECESSARY TO ASPHYXIATE THE RICH, OTHERWISE THEY WILL STRIKE
   BACK 100X HARDER.

- As for economic policy, how do the communists respond? They have
  already monopolized control over commodities -- and if a country
  does not have an economy oriented around commodities, then communism
  doesn't work well (Russia: gas/oil; China: famine and lack of GDP
  growth until 1971).

- To get their command economy to function, the Communist Party needs
  individuals to behave deterministically. They need a strong rapport
  with a predictable population who is eager to please the Party. With
  social engineering, the party tries to rewire the values systems of
  their population -- with language, deified revolutionaries and
  mythology -- to align themselves with the micro/macro tactics of the
  Party's economic strategy.


- How does structuralism connect to complexity theory? Communists need
  to be able to adapt the behavior of individuals so that it conforms
  with their command-economy strategy, but their economic needs change
  rapidly, especially when the Party lacks control over externalities
  -- which is why Communists need satellite states, which turns out to
  be a bit of a pyramid scheme until you have
  #WorldRevolution. Because communists *must* grow a predictable
  population, they turn to social engineering to remove statistical
  variables from the cultural equation -- i.e. they need to control
  almost all variables by default, like in a scientific
  experiment. They want *some* variation and can't control everything,
  but they must eliminate behaviors from individuals which cause large
  ripple effects in the economic behavior of other
  individuals. OTHERWISE THEIR COMMAND ECONOMY POLICES **CANNOT**
  FUNCTION TO PREDICT AGGREGATE BEHAVIOR. Near total control over
  every aspect of their people's lives it's necessary for the
  Politburo's economic models to not completely fuck everything up.

- Yet, a predictable population is a deterministic population. One
  major benefit to democracy? Who the fuck knows how America's going
  to vote in 2020? What could happen? What direction will the country
  move in? Who knows. We could do anything. Any individual in America
  could do almost anything at any moment and maybe even change the
  world.

- Their over-reliance on social engineering renders Communists
  inflexible and unable to culturally adapt to the needs that present
  their society. If political systems were the #ThreeLittlePigs,
  Communism lives in a straw house. When the "Imperialist West" or
  NATO or anyone so much as breathes on the shitty Communist straw hut
  of an economy, the predictability of their population/leaders
  combined with their obvious & centrally controlled
  #EconomicExternalities renders hell on their economy. Now all the
  #Politiburo's work was for NOTHING because something unexpected
  happened.

- Their attempt to use structuralism's ideas, intentionally or not,
  intersects with complexity theory in two major places:
  #SocialEngineering and #EconomicModeling. Both are profoundly
  complex and both are intractable. Soviet economic theorists and
  mathematicians famously could not develop a sound theory/basis for
  their economy because those problems are computationally
  intractable. It's very similar to the difference between #Numeric
  and #Analytic methods in math, where numeric methods are like
  gradient descent used in machine learning. With gradient descent,
  **there's always an answer**. it might not be the best answer and
  you may not be able to determine if you can find a better answer,
  but you can tell if your answer is better than it was last
  time. it's based on optimization/maximization of signals --
  e.g. some cost function. But for many problems -- famously, most
  cases in General Relativity -- there are no known analytical
  solutions.
  - [Numerical
    Relatively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_relativity)

- Physics is simple, but still unbelievably complicated -- just search
  for a paper on Hamiltonian bifurcations (not that i really
  understand them). Systems increase to unbelievable complexity after
  adding a few particles (i.e. degrees of freedom). #Econophysics is
  much harder and equilibrium is violated all over, so many ideas from
  physics don't really carry over. #SocialPhysics introduces
  #InteractiveEpistemology, agent-based behavior and wierd ontological
  singularities, where an agent is self-conscious and has to think
  about other self-conscious things that feedback into itself,
  depending on the epistemic and doxastic information available. The
  tractibility of econophysics is why Soviet's couldn't solve their
  economic problems. The tractibility of social physics is why social
  engineering can't produce predictable results. Instead, it requires
  heuristic approaches to evolution/adaptation and demands generations
  of time. That humanity may not evolve socially evolve to match the
  Singularity's demands is our century's danger of dangers.

- #NickLand is correct, there are non-human forces that exert
  influence over society: they are higher-order organisms/entities
  that respond cybernetically to social/economic signals. The way he
  inverts Kant's transcendentalism is fascinating, if a bit difficult
  for me to follow -- he claims the subject doesn't exist as an
  "ontological singularity" and instead can be
  objectified/restructured by the other, to poorly explain it. But the
  world isn't just us subjects sharing the experience of
  self-consciousness.

  =======

  I mean that computational models of social behavior don't scale to
  large groups without sacrificing granularity. you can't brute force
  models in social physics bc almost everything is undecidable unless
  you use #CoarseGraining. In order for the human brain to reason
  about social behavior, our neurological wetware takes all kinds of
  shortcuts:

- assuming group behaviors conform to norms and that dissonance from norms signals intent
- attention signals investment, therefore discovering what individuals
  are focused or where they're looking tells you about what they're
  thinking

- we enshrine norms in law, tradition, religion, etc. because doing so reduces the spatial complexity of sociophysical problems. when everyone adheres to certain norms, it reduces various possibility spaces by orders of magnitude. everyone's on the same wavelength, so to speak.
- we unconsciously & consciously crowdsource for feedback from other
people.

all of these are heuristic and/or cybernetic approaches to social
behavior & planning. the particular shortcuts that are wired into our
brain or mind result in all kinds of idiosyncratic psychological
characteristics, things like swarming behaviors, and lots of paradoxes
related to social behavior.

========

Russia was suffering from debt incurred from the embarrassing defeat
in Russo-Japanese War, from WW1, and from the Trans-Siberian rail
(that the Tsarists had kindly finished in time to have their economy
crash). the Soviets repudiated all the debt immediately after gaining
power.

But really, the Bolshevik movement would *not* have been possible if
the Tsarists weren't goaded by Rasputin and Bolshevik operators into
mismanaging their economy and nation.

========

Communists need a population that is more predictable (i.e. in
statistical terms, they would prefer to have a population where an
individual's possible event types are Measurable, if it were
possible). By failing to do carry out social engineering to do so, I
mean that they couldn't "reprorgram" the population quickly enough to
adapt to threats. Homogeny is the mother of weakness (and
predictability).



=========



  - exploiting political correctness to:
    - modulate usage of language by regulating norms
    - dilute old norms, accelerate normative changes, engineer new norms
    - shift overton window to exclude specific proposition types, thus
      rendering argumentative conclusions unreachable
    - change how existing laws are enforced by subtly shifting meaning
      & public sentiment to accelerate/amplify/mute the consequences,
      while reorienting enforcement focus/energy towards & away from
      specific offenders or types of transgressions.
    - manipulate social experience, the conscious reflection on those
      experiences and how individuals choose to propagate information
      about them.
      - i.e. if you prevent people from talking about specific
        subjects or perspectives for long enough, the social memory of
        connected topics/ideas begins to fade, for better or worse.
      - or if feedback loops amplify other subjects/perspectives, they
        become engrained in social memory.
      - after long enough, this shifts what is conscious and
        unconscious; it keeps our attention/cognition confined to what
        seems comfortable.
    - for various issues, the potential social interaction
      motivations/outcomes b/w individuals and the resulting dynamics
      thereof determine how populations collectively respond,
      psychologically and socially. examples of long-term response to
      our "political crisis culture" in individuals include:
      - becoming conditioned with triggers, including some that can
        provoke responses similar to those seen in BPD
      - magickal thinking (esp. when conditioning results in changes
        to metaprogramming)
      - relationships damaged by trigger response (however it happens)
      - vulnerability to predatory behavior
      - anxiety, PTSD, withdrawal/avoidance of specific social environments
      - schizoid breaks, schizoid personality disorder, false memory syndrome
      - loss of control over one's identity (and/or sense of identity)
  - examples of exploiting changes in language:
    - 67 genders (neologisms)
    - preferred pronouns (far more impactful than neologisms)
      - while it's reasonable to expect people to refer to transgender
        people according to their chosen sex, this is being amplified
        as a political communications hack.
      - pronouns are used so frequently that they aren't usually
        included in Zipf's distribution. the frequency of occurance
        and magnitude of the provoked conscious/subconscious
        psychological responses. here, i mean that someone with a
        strong response who is invested in the issue of misgendering
        or transexuality. even if they do not experience a conscious
        emotional or cognitive response, if they have invested, then
        subconscious mental processes may escape their awareness.
        - e.g. in Jungian terms, righteousness and pride can cast long
          shadows
        - Some subconscious processes may quickly circuit one's
          cognition away from the unfamiliar/uncomfortable to ground
          it in familiar, engrained flows of thought. Tools to model
          these aspects of cognition include markov models, plate
          models and time series analysis with network theory and
          cliques. The last of these, cliques, may be imagined to
          correspond to cogntive state where the graph nodes
          correspond to information representations. Thoughts are then
          sequences of clique activations and cognitive tendencies
          (e.g. rapid response in BPD or PTSD to specific stimuli or
          topics) can be modeled by transition probilities for clique
          activations. (that's all an oversimplification but it's
          easier to think about)
          - ==> A person's cognitive circuits have a kind of momentum
            , corresponding to and without the right push delivering
            sufficient energy to change the circuits, those tendencies
            will continue
          - A different kind of circuits exist for the transmission of
            information in society. a consequence of network theory,
            the bandwidth, distribution and sprawl of these channels
            can be characterized by power laws. some individuals,
            groups or entities have an extremely disproportionate
            influence over communication in modern society --
            Facebook, Twitter, social media publishers with
            "influencer" networks, 24-hour "news" networks, radio,
            internet, podcast, etc. It doesn't leave much room for
            organic word of mouth, which until writing and the
            printing press was it. What's not so obvious: when
            publisher on communication channels is sufficiently
            extreme and when subscribers are time-limited or
            rate-limited to maximum information consumed, your
            networks can proactively drive a near entirety of the
            network's information. Information is prioritized by
            [publishers &
            subscribers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish–subscribe_pattern)
            (i.e. publishers & consumers) according to it's priority,
            exclusivity, scarcity and age. Since aged information can
            only become more widely distributed with time,
            practically, it loses its value with each source-hop and
            each minute. Thus, if you own the 0.01% of the
            communications channels and if people prioritize their
            time-limited, rate-limited consumption from your sources,
            then you can spew out artificial and fabricated
            information ... to the extent that you control the
            spectrum of information. In extreme cases, almost no
            spectra of information (i.e. "frequencies" or specific
            forms of information) will be amplified beyond a specific
            dB gain level, except what the 0.01% of publishers produce
            and the first-order reverberations of those information
            spectra -- forms of information which the 21st century
            pace invalidates almost as soon as they are created. That
            is, information distribution is so disproportionate, it's
            like all internet routers on earth have their IP Protocol
            configured to limit packets to 3 hops, except for 100
            backbone routers with no TTL hop limit. This is equivalent
            to a stadium (circus maximus) full of people only able to
            talk in whispers that barely reach the person beside them,
            while 6 people are competing with near-deafening sound
            systems. What are people going to talk about? And think
            about? Will any original thoughts or words occupy more
            than a handful of of minds? Would anything go viral,
            organically? This can also be imagined as a kind of
            informational [noise filter]() that attentuates
            information spectra below a dB level, keeping most
            people's words from reaching anyone but their closest
            virtual connections.
        - when radicals socially gamify these communication hacks and
          goad moderates into pressing the issue, they can strongly
          amplify the growth or dispersion of specific topics in
          social memory or social cognition.
          - this is made 1000x more dangerous by the above
            implications of power laws: the top-down publisher channel
            bandwidth and access limits and the bottom up subscriber
            consumption time/rate limits. Radicals can enforce
            their designs on norms and political correctness to...
          -
        - for pronouns, frequency and magnitude of response are...
        - construction and dynamic modification of grammar to ensure
          that syntax accords with the gender of the subject/object
          pronouns requires integration with parts of the mind that
          are entirely subconscious.
          - because of this, one can become triggered by the
            dissonance b/w the conscious mind's response to how the
            subconscious generates grammar or wordchoice. depending on
            whether the dissonance exceeds the normative threshold
            considered politically correct -- or what is simply
            "respectful" for people with common sense -- then
            conscious intervention is required to suit speech to
            norms.
          - this is all fine, until the physiological responses to
            this dissonance are considered because these may be
            telegraphed as VAGUE social signals, qualitative and
            quantitative, which can be used to poorly judge
            someone.
            - the most socially obvious of these (and most often used)
              is the conscious mind's time spent reprocessing which
              can used to poorly judge you. how long someone spends
              reacting to a stimulus exhibits how well conditioned,
              how subconsciously engrained and how cognitively
              involved the process was. here, the stimulus may be the
              conscious mind's imposition of norms in reaction to
              dissonance, but can also include other interjected
              stimuli from the social environment.
            - we do not have control over our subconscious mind, not
              directly. while adaptation can be accelerated, changes
              are slow to come, the bandwidth for persistent change to
              the subconscious mind is limited and intentionally
              directed changes are improbable, unless the subject is
              willing. perhaps worst of all, if those in the social
              environment improperly trigger this dissonance, the
              subconscious response will only become more
              engrained. the more emotionally invested and anxious the
              person becomes when triggered -- THAT IS, *IF THEY CARE
              ABOUT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS* -- then the more strongly the
              subconscious conditioning is reinforced.
            - this is especially when there are no straightforward
              conversations about certain topics. to change their
              subconscious response. Yes, i'm talking about you,
              social justice warriors (and others), who may prompt *or
              dupe* people around the subject to vaguely interprety
              "how the subject feels about X, Y, Z" by provoking these
              reactions. [Guerilla Theatre]() is a real tactic in
              leftist groups. It is incredibly useful for socially
              "processing" supporters, bystanders and opposition for
              conformity to specific norms or willingness to conform.



  - what exploitation of language
