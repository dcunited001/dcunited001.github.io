So I saw a post by
[Bill Gates on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141021225933-251749025-a-call-for-crazy-ideas),
calling for crazy ideas.  It linked to an organization calling for
solutions to three new problems and a dozen others.  They offered
grants, which I have no interest in, nor did I have suggestions to the
health problems they suggested.

### However, I have some other crazy ideas:

One is for protein folding algorithms and another for possible
RNA-based HIV treatments. Probably just pipe dreams though, but I
commented on the article anyway.  They're probably not wholly
original, nor do I have any means of pursuing them.

### (1) "Natural" Protein Folding Algorithms.

Protein folding algorithms that attempt to completely and
realistically recreate the protein creation algorithm, including pH,
ribosomes, amino acid availability, codon availability, and
intracellular brownian motion.  I noticed playing FoldIt that many of
the puzzles started with proteins that were either a straight chain or
partially folded, probably at a bad local minimum.

But, if this process is reconstructed as accurately as possible,
wouldn't the correct protein shapes simply be reconstructed? The
process of constructing a protein will introduce forces and other
factors which would greatly affect the resulting shape of a
protein. So at least, wouldn't a more natural algorithm significantly
limit the outcomes?

#### The most important question:

If the probability of having these resulting shapes is statistically
significant enough to be reliable for life itself, then why do we have
such a problem finding them?

### (2) Epigenetic & Novel HIV treatments

RNA-based HIV treatments that hack the transcription factors and
epigenetic factors that HIV inserts into white blood cells. In other
words, could a treatment similar to RNAi be used to prevent RNA
polymerase from binding to HIV-specific transcription sites?

Does HIV have a mechanism for "turning up" it's own genes by altering
the attached epigenetic factors? And if so, how does it attach those
epigenetic factors, how does it mark them to ramp up their expression,
and can we safely manipulate those processes? Or, perhaps we can
interfere with the viral RNA that's emitted from a cell's nucleus when
the it expresses an HIV gene. *Or maybe there's a way to set up "HIV
Honeypots," harmless vacuoles with surface proteins that trick HIV
into attaching and neutralizing itself.*

**Update 2/19/15:** From a high level, this HIV Honeypot strategy is
very similar to the promising
[novel HIV](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hiv-vaccine-20150217-story.html)
treatment just announced this week!

### It's important to note ...

... That I have no idea what I'm talking about. lulz.  These are just
some of the problems tumbling around in my head that I like to think
about.  I wish I had the tools available to answer these questions.

Or the time to complete the relevant classes on Coursera.  Ugh, I get
so frustrated when I turn in something late on that site and my grade
drops to a B/C, especially when it's a class where I know the material
and deserve an A.
