### Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down!

And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there.

I'll tell you how I became the pariah of a town called #Boulder.

So I'm going to tell you about the worst thing that has ever happened
to me in my life, so far.  While it wasn't so bad in itself and
could've been much worse, it was moreso the circumstances of my life
in which it happened that made it so terrible. This occurred in
Boulder, CO in July 2013, *immediately* after I had moved there from
Denver.

A few people have heard parts of this story.  Some have heard all of
it.  But I'm tired of retelling it.  I want this in its entireity, in
one place.  I have dealt with this on my own long enough and I want to
get it off my chest.  If you helped me during this time, I cannot
thank you enough.  I am so glad the people at **Boulder Fuse** and
**SSD**, **the Boulder Hackerspace**, were trying to help me out.

My life was extremely chaotic at this time.  I didn't feel good.  I
was depressed and extremely stressed.  I'm pretty sure I had some
psychosomatic symptoms, where the level of stress and my emotional
states were actually causing me physical problems as well.  At the
time, I thought it was the bedbug poison that surrounded me at home.
I did not feel like myself and stopped physical activites like
skateboarding because of this wierd feeling of weakness in my
nerves/muscles.  It was probably self-induced by my state of mind, but
I was spending hours of time on Wikipedia looking into ALS, MS, etc,
but couldn't find anything that matched.  At one point, I had pins and
needles in one leg, though it wasn't falling asleep.  Anyways ...

### So what's that like?  You know, being a * **Pariah**?*

Picture yourself, having just moved to a new area an hour away, though
you're 25 hours from *home*.  You've been living in Colorado for 4
months now and you've made a few good friends in Denver.  But, you've
just moved to Boulder after having a severe case of "the grass is
greener."

Then, three weeks after you arrive, your new roommate, who you barely
know, informs you that your new apartment has bedbugs.  At the end of
June, he leaves for the
[Rainbow Gathering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Gathering) in
Montana, leaving you alone.  You could go if you want.  However, you
don't have much desire to hang out with thousands of hippies doing
fingerprints of acid until they shit themselves.  Instead, you're
interviewing for a new job and need to get your shit straight in
preparation.

> So ... there's certain things that happen to me ... and I don't
> think they happen to other people ...

You're a fairly quiet person, very introspective.  And you haven't had
a chance to make real friends yet.  By real friends, I mean the kind
of people you feel comfortable asking to help you deal with some
serious problems.  Problems which would would surely mean these true
friends would have to be willing take on some pain in order to help
you out.  And sometimes you just don't know how to ask for help.

#### 2013/7/7 View from the roof of the Boulder Hackerspace

I took this picture on the first day I got paid and the day I started
new job at JumpCloud.  Things were starting to look up, but there was
still no light at the end of the tunnel.

### TL; DR;

I'm starting to write a bit too much, so I'm going to try to sum up
how the situation impacted my life first.  Then I'll go into more
details, including what happened.  I was psychologyically traumatized
by this.  As in PTSD.  Maybe I wasn't in a warzone, but 6 to 12 months
afterwards, I was constantly reliving these situations.  Constantly
replaying memories and ruminating, trying to establish what I could
have done to limit the impact of these situations.  Trying to figure
out what I did wrong, why I deserved to go through this.

> for help without hurting those people who gave me help!

Basically, I ended up in a situation where I was isolated and had no
support network.  I even lost my phone right at the worst time and had
a hard time contacting my family for about three weeks.  I had to deal
with this severe problem that I was deathly afraid of talking to
anyone about, since I likely couldn't prevent this infestation from
spreading.

![Coworkers at Boulder Fuse](/img/posts/2015-02-01-bedbugs-the-worst-to-ever-happen-to-me/fuse-1.jpeg)

#### Coworkers at [Boulder Fuse](http://boulderfuse.com).

I was working at an extremely cool coworking space in Boulder at the
time.  [Boulder Fuse](https://www.facebook.com/BoulderFuse), a great
place, run by great people.  I was afraid of getting them infected --
and may have, since these bedbugs can hitch a ride on your belongings.
So to combat this, I wanted to minimize my time spent at home.

![The view from my desk at Boulder Fuse](/img/posts/2015-02-01-bedbugs-the-worst-to-ever-happen-to-me/view-from-my-desk.jpg)

#### [2013/6/22 - the view from my desk at Boulder Fuse](http://instagram.com/p/a8WCD0y5ah/?modal=true)

So, I adopted a 48-hour sleep schedule: this would mean I'd spend only
half my days at home.  On alternating nights, I stayed awake at the
Boulder Fuse's amazing office, fueling passion on my projects with
adderal and countless packs of American Spirit.

> However, today I'm proud to say that I haven't smoked a single
> cigarette in 14 months!

So I only made the trek home when it was necessary.  Sometimes, I
passed out on the creekbed outside, during the day.  When I returned
home, I only reluctantly slept in my bed -- a pretty amazing mattress
my friend had left in his place for me.  Instead, I slept outside on
the patio!

While I didn't have any furniture, I was also afraid of this problem
following me to the next apartment I found myself in.  I ultimately
found myself homeless immediately after starting a new job.  I had
plenty of money, but I was so busy, I couldn't search for an
apartment.  Not to mention that I didn't have a car.  After my first
lease was up, I stored my belongings -- which, thankfully, was no more
than I could [barely] carry at one time -- in my friend's pickup
truck.  Rain or shine, it don't make no matta.

#### [2013/8/2 Shooting Star](http://instagram.com/p/Z6vTWzy5eb/?modal=true) - taken at the beginning of my homelessness.

For a period of three weeks, I had a really tough time finding a place
to stay.  Remember, I had only lived in Boulder for a few weeks!  I
started sleeping at the office.  I tried to keep it on the D/L, but my
manager at Jumpcloud put an end to this pretty quickly, for insurance
reasons.  My manager and teammates recommended getting a hotel, just
until I could sort things out.

I stayed in a hotel for a few nights at a time.  This was especially
annoying, as it ate into my savings for a lease on an apartment.  The
hotel kicked me out after a few nights.  And so, instead of searching
for an apartment, I found myself, alone, dragging everything I owned
in Colorado along with me around Downtown Boulder.  To my workmates,
I'm pretty sure I looked like a pathetic piece of shit who couldn't
even handle the most basic needs in his personal life.  A great first
impression for a new work environment, *doncha know?!*

![The hot tub at the Foot of the Mountain Motel](/img/posts/2015-02-01-bedbugs-the-worst-to-ever-happen-to-me/hot-tub-time-machine.jpg)

In this picture, my hat's inside out, showing the Mandelbrot patterns
inside.  It's what's inside that counts, right?  I was lucky enough to
get a room here.  I remember that at this time, all the students'
parents were in Boulder, helping their kids move in.  This made it
really difficult to find even a hotel room!

Oh, and I was suffering from a bout a Irritable Bowel Syndrome for
those few weeks.  Another great impression, right?

My manager at Jumpcloud wouldn't let me keep my stuff at the office --
again, for insurance reasons.  So, I occasionally found myself storing
my possessions openly in the parking garage below our office, while I
was at work.  I got to the point where staying at the hotel was
completely eating up my savings for a place, so I had to do something
else.

I found this blanket I could use, which at night I carried with me to
the outskirts of Boulder.  Rain was my worst enemy and I slept under
the open sky.  And amazing, I didn't lose my mind through all of this,
which I attribute to my Buddhist beliefs.  I told myself that I was
camping and that I should appreciate the chance I got to do this
because -- let's be honest -- I'm not the guy who usually goes
camping.  I love the outdoors, don't get me wrong.  I just don't
usually prompt myself with the opportunity.

![My Campgounds](/img/posts/2015-02-01-bedbugs-the-worst-to-ever-happen-to-me/the-campgrounds.jpg)

#### A picture of the exact spot I camped at, above that twisted pine. In Boulder, camping is illegal.

Anyways, so how was I showering?  Luckily, my colleagues had recently
suggested we all get a gym membership, so I showered there.  How was I
changing?  I kept extra changes of clothes and underwear in my desk!
Additionally, these became particularly useful when, for whatever
reason, a toilet exploded on me at work after I took a shit!!  So,
again...

> So ... there's certain things that happen to me ... and I don't
> think they happen to other people ...

Anyways, for at least a week, my schedule was the following:

- **6:00am:** Wake up and walk back into Boulder.
- **7:00am:** Arrive at the office before anyone else and find some
  clothes I had stashed in my desk.
- **7:15am:** Run to the gym, luckily a few blocks away -- because I
  like to keep it simple.
- **7:30am:** Phony 15 minute workout to justify being at the gym to
  take a shower.
- **7:45am:** Quick shower.
- **8:00am:** Back to the office to arrive early, which admittedly was
  a change of pace.
- **9:00am:** Work for a while.
- **6:00pm:** Get off from work.  I liked to stay late.  I didn't have
  anyone else to hang out with really.
- **7:00pm:** I stayed close to the office, so I could return after
  everyone left. To search for apartments, not catch up on work.

And for the rest of the night, I would desparately search listings on
Craigslist, while just as desparately trying to find somewhere to stay
with that night.  Most of these listings were were out of my price
range.  Or at least exceeded my current savings at the time -- I could
afford to live there, but couldn't afford the security deposit.  And
this is all occuring at the same time University of Colorado Boulder
is returning to school, increasing the amount of competition for
places to live.

#### [2013/6/25](http://instagram.com/p/bAYTssy5fP/?modal=true) - View from the Boulder Fuse patio, which was my office away from the office.

I even had to wear my swim trunks at one point because I hadn't had a
chance do laundry.  I used the excuse that I was going tubing with
some friends later, which I was.  It was one of the few times I got to
see friends from Virginia.  I felt pretty fucked up for not being able
to let them crash at my place, but I couldn't bring myself to tell
them what was really going on!  I didn't know them too terribly well.

Admittedly, a lot of this is my fault for not taking care of finding a
new place earlier.  However, I was seriously overwhelmed by my new job
*and* the moral delimma that bedbugs posed.  Fortunately, after about
2 weeks of being homeless, I had found my next place.  I wasn't able
to move in just yet, but my new roommate was generous enough to allow
me to store my stuff in his garage.  I cannot emphasize enough how
this simplified my life at the time.

My apartment complex neighbor across the way had Tibetan prayer flags
hanging up and it got me thinking.  The day before I moved out, I
posted this pic following on Facebook, along with the following
caption.

### Acting Against My Beliefs

I had recently become more enthusiastic about embracing Buddhism.
Many of these ideas had come to save me from much of the pain I had
experienced in my life, years prior.  I had learned that the pain I
was experiencing was really a result of the cage my beliefs had
constructed around myself.  All I had to do was reshape my beliefs and
I could escape.  Briefly studying aspects of Buddhism had provided me
with tools that I had found infinitely valuable, over and over again.

I had even begun to try vegitarianism, except for eggs and fish.  And
if you know me, this is a huge step for me, not easy at all.  While I
don't each much pork or beef, it's a huge change in my habits.
However, being vegitarian is moreso a conclusion of Buddhism than a
foundational tenet, as some believe.  That is, if you truly act as one
with the beliefs of Buddhism, you would be vegetarian because you
desire suffering to end for all sentient life.  Yet, there are many
more important insights about life and its experiences that most would
likely accept before finding themselves there.

Yet suddenly, I found myself alone in a situation where I could easily
escape, supposedly, if I might just forsake one of Buddhism's most
important conclusions: that all forms of life are sacred.  Even those
forms of life which you'd rather not have to deal with: parasites and
disease bearing life.  All I had to do was poison my apartment --
although there is no guarantee this would work because bedbugs are
notoriously difficult to eliminate.

Additionally, there are the karmic consequences of selfishly acting on
my own beliefs.  Failing to act would allow this infestation to spread
to my neighbors, forcing them to commit the same sins I had forbid
myself to commit.  It would create the exact same situation for
others.  And maybe this aspect of the problem seems silly to you --
just $#@!'ing deal with the problem already -- but to me, this was yet
another aspect of the already severe problem I was dealing with!

I spent many nights at home balling my eyes out over this issue.
Partially because it opened my eyes to the possibility of similar
problems which cannot be defined in black and white.

### The Toxicity of Our City

Another aspect of the dilemma is that I'm a "chemophobe."  In other
words, I do not want to have to live in a home with neurotoxic
chemicals.  My roommate brought home bedbug poison and they don't even
list the chemicals in that stuff.  If you know that many bugsprays and
mosquito repellants contain neurotoxins capable of contributing to
Parkinson's disease by interfering with your body's dopaminergic
systems, you're going to be pretty wary of unlisted chemicals which
are probably neurotoxic or poisonous to humans, too.

After all, life evolved in similar environments and much life has
common ancestry.  While not necessarily true, what is detrimental to
one species or form of life is often toxic to others.  Our genes and
systems are more similar than we realize.  It's actually epigenetics
and the expression of genes which accounts for the diversity of life
and NOT the genes themselves!

In other words, various forms of life are built with "lego pieces,"
which are mostly the same.  It's how these pieces are snapped together
that makes the difference.  Some branches in the tree of life contain
unique pieces, but we share many of the more important pieces.  There
are many exceptions and this reasoning can't be used to determine a
specific safety profile or general scientific policy, but it's still a
useful generalization.  More on this topic in a separate article.

### May 2013

Taking it back a few months, and I've just lost the coolest job that
I've ever had.  I worked at Weedmaps, where I happily worked with a
team of great people.  Best of all, I felt that I was working for a
company where I could be myself.  While we obviously couldn't smoke at
work, I didn't have to hide my marijuana usage from other employees.
I wasn't afraid that marijuana usage would be politically used against
me.  I was contributing to an industry I was passionate about.
Everything was perfect.

Well, there was "that one guy" who I thought was being a bit
manipulative, divisive and political.  However, I've learned that this
is usually the rule and not the exception.  Whenever you're in an
environment where there's an incentive for people to gain advantage --
or avoid losing their job -- you're going to end up with some
political players like this.

If it's just that one guy, then your problems really aren't that bad.
If you deal with these people in the right way, you can come to an
understanding, though it may not be easy.  Mostly, you need to make
sure everyone sees how interactions are playing out between this
person and others.  Again, more on this topic very soon.

So, I lost this job after a new manager came on board and they
switched technologies from Ruby to Java.  A few Ruby guys were let go,
all at the same time.  I saw it coming, but they gave us a great
severance package.  I didn't want to leave, but are you really going
to argue much when you walk out of the door with like $5,000 and your
last paycheck on the way?

### A Chance to Work on my Awesome Music Startup Idea!

#### *Just Kidding!*

This was the middle of May, right before
[Startup Week Boulder](http://boulderstartupweek.com/).  At the time,
I wanted to use this extra cash as a means of feuling my own startup,
[Oscillate](http://oscil.io).  I had this idea since October 2011.  It
would be like a Github for music, where producers could collaborate on
new tracks.

Instead, I chose to help someone else work on their startup idea.
This was Nei.ghbor.Net.  It was for a distributed, meshnet application
platform.  Meshnet is really amazing technology and could completely
circumvent the possibility of NSA surveillance!  There are amazingly
unique possibilities for this technology.

It's too bad the [Nei.ghbor.Net](http://nei.ghbor.net) blog is offline
now =/ Otherwise, you could get a better idea of what we were working
on.  Oh wait --
*[HERE IT IS!](https://web.archive.org/web/20130715004732/http://nei.ghbor.net/main)*
-- God bless your heart, Internet Archive.  Sometimes, it really pays
to think ahead.  Thankfully, I thought of visiting the site on the
Internet Archive in July 2013 ... You know, just in case :)

Certainly, this was revolutionary and more important than the music
startup I was working on.  Plus, I have the mindset that I can do
anything and achieve anything, so I'm more likely to follow paths with
high-risk and high-reward.  We just needed to find the most basic
implementation of this technology -- the **Twitter** of MeshNet, if
you will.

I love Twitter because it's like the "atom of web applications."  What
I mean by this is that Twitter is like the simplest web application.
It is so simple that you could say the product was like an indivisible
set of features that composed the simplest thing you could do on the
internet -- share 140 characters.  Because of this, you could never
replace Twitter by genericizing or imitating it.  It's already the
simplest thing that anything like it could ever be and it has already
established market dominance there.

Therefore, it's secure in its position, so long as Twitter never
extended its featureset to become something it's not.  Additionally,
the only way for Twitter to be endangered from the outside is to be
out-compete it by swaying it's user base and pulling them to other
similar web applications, like Facebook.

Nei.ghbor.Net just needed an app like that -- the simplest, most basic
application that could run on our platform.  If we could define and
provide the platform, coupled with the simplest app, then we could put
the app together.  This was *MY* reasoning behind the concept for
**Shout!** -- the app our team at
[Hack4CO](http://www.hack4colorado.com/) put together.

Additionally, Shout! (and nearly all Meshnet apps) would be
anonymized, a la the Secret app, which didn't come along until later.
That is, it wouldn't require to use authentication to use the app.
That means you can connect with people that you *don't already know*,
which was a limitation I had found annoying with current web
applications.

I can't take credit for the whole Shout! idea, but it was my idea that
it would be the simplest meshnet application.  And one of my concepts
was for a cross between Twitter and Foursquare.

![The Frozen Banana Stand](/img/posts/2015-02-01-bedbugs-the-worst-to-ever-happen-to-me/frozen-banana-stand.jpg)

#### [2013/6/29](http://instagram.com/p/bJ_6nVy5Tq/?modal=true) - I worked the Frozen Banana Stand at one of Boulder Fuse's Riverside events.

Look at me ^^ I started a business =)

### So, what was Shout!, anyways?

Shout! would show you what's going on in your neighborhood.  It was
like an anonymized cross between Twitter and Foursqure, where users
could search their local area for other people shouting.  That means
they could see other users posting shouts within a search window of
their local area: within 5 blocks, half a mile or 5 miles from them --
**even if you did not 'follow' that user**.

Users could easily see shouts from people at the bar down the street,
where a live show was being played by that band they'd never heard.
Everyone's shouts would be posted on a map that people could view to
see what was going on in the local area, even if they didn't follow
these people.  Obviously there were many problems that we would need
to solve, including spam and technical challenges.

And the best part?  Shout! was meshnet -- none of this data would
touch the internet!  That's what was revolutionary. It would be
relayed through intermediate devices and it would not touch the
internet.  However, I didn't realize just how technically challenging
it would be, but I gave up my *best opportunity* to work on my music
startup *so far* to work on it anyways.  After our team attended
Boulder Startup Week, I suggested that we couldn't afford not to move
up to Boulder.  The grass there was sooo green!  But really, in
retrospect, this was a huge mistake.  I should've just tried to find a
job in Denver, where rent is half priced, and then worked on my
startup until then.  But I took the risk and paid the price.

Other great Meshnet applications include: decentralized wikipedias for
sharing ideas **off-net** (this was my friend's idea) and apps to
allow protestors to communicate in the event of, say, Egyptian
tele-communication shutdowns.  You literally **can't** stop it. **Mwa
haha!** Also, unbeknownst to us at the time, a great Meshnet app
called [FireChat](https://opengarden.com/firechat) later did just
that!  FireChat was used in the
[2014 protests in Hong Kong](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/tech/mobile/tomorrow-transformed-firechat/)!

You **will** see widespread meshnet.  It might be 2020, but it's
coming.  Or so says professional über-nerd,
[Van Jacobson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqGEMQveoqg), all the
way back in 2007.  And he works at Google!

Also, Apple included Meshnet in iOS 7.  So the capabilities are
coming.  But there are some incredibly, incredibly complicated
problems to solve.  Some of them are practical problems, some of them
are very technical -- like new routing protocols that just aren't
there yet.  Some of the problems are in the business models -- today's
apps monetize through advertising and by utilizing Big Data.  In
meshnet apps, your data never touches central servers -- and IMO
that's the best part.  But, whats the incentive to make these apps, if
monetizing is going to be incredibly complicated?

#### Phew, my point there was to demonstrate why I thought it would be worthwhile to give up development of my own app.

Sometimes, I forget how amazing it was to briefly work on this
project.  *It's the fuuutuuurrree, maannnn*
**&lt;/heady-techno-hippie&gt;**

### Sooo... Did Ya *Ever* Move to Boulder?

At the time, my friend, who was also working on Nei.ghbor.Net, said
his brother was moving out of his place in Boulder.  I could get a
really good deal on it, but I could only live there for two months.  A
really good deal, as in basically $1000 for two months for a 2BR
apartment in a town where you can't find a 2BR for less than $1300 for
one month.  Now, if that isn't an offer you can't refuse, I don't know
what is.  I paid for two apartments in June to cover the one I had in
Denver!  When I was unemployed and not receiving unemployment --
something I have never received by the way.

![My desk at Boulder Fuse](/img/posts/2015-02-01-bedbugs-the-worst-to-ever-happen-to-me/my-desk-at-fuse.jpg)

#### [2013/6/16](http://instagram.com/p/aosuOfy5TL/?modal=true) My Desk during this time, at Boulder Fuse.  Before I had found out about the bedbugs.

Additionally, he said that he'd be moving in with me in a few weeks
and that we'd work on the Nei.ghbor.Net startup there.  I stressed
that we need to put together an MVP quickly to get funding.
Otherwise, I'd run out of money.  From May to June, I hung out a lot
at the Boulder Hackerspace and saw my friend several times there.  But
it didn't look like he was going to move in.  Running out of money and
uncertain of the future of our situation, I started looking at jobs
and I found one in time.  So, I more or less needed to pull back from
Nei.ghbor.Net and start focusing on my new job.

### Started Working at Jumpcloud

### Got Fired From Jumpcloud

When I got fired from Jumpcloud, it was almost a relief.  I had plenty
of time to quit, *but I'm not a quitter.* And to me, losing one
opportunity may just be the beginning of something greater.  So it
actually was pretty relieving.

And at least I had a place to stay.  Things had been much worse and I
would be OK -- I had enough fund to survive for two months.  Maybe I
lost my job, but it wasn't so bad.  There were plenty of tech jobs in
Boulder.  And when I worked at Jumpcloud, it seemed like people were
throwing jobs offers at me.  But, not so much afterwards.

This is not what I was used to, as a talented Rails developer.  I
didn't get it, but for the jobs I was interested in -- like SendGrid
and a few others -- I couldn't get past the phone screen.  I'm not
sure what the problem was.  There were other opportunities, but I am
very, very picky when it comes to finding a place to work.  I would
much rather not work at all in most cases.

Software is something I do because I love it.  Working at a business
doing software means that I'll spend all day working on what your
business needs, which hopefully is something I love working on.
However, when I get home, I'll likely be too mentally exhausted to
work on the software and technologies that I want to.  I'll be
restricted in what technologies I can invest the time learning and I
probably won't have the time or energy to take Coursera classes.  So,
you see, there's a major economic opportunity cost to having a job!

And so, after all this, I quickly fell into a pretty bad depression.
I had forsaken my inner peace long ago by this point and it was really
tough for me.  I was stressed that I would let my new roommate down by
being unable to pay rent and putting him in the awkward position of
having to kick me out.  This was a guy who was extremely knowledgeable
about Buddhism and taught me a ton.  I really looked up to him -- and
he even introduced me to Kendall Musk, Elon Musk's brother, who is
changing the world in his own way.  Kendall Musk, who own's Boulder's
[The Kitchen](http://thekitchen.com/the-kitchen-boulder/), is working
on changing how restaurants source their food, working on making it
easier to support the local food economy.

My roommate tried to help me out by offering me a job at the business
where he worked.  However, I was afraid that it was too far away and,
worse, that I would let him down he might look bad. It was a position
working with Java, which I don't have too much experience with.  I was
just starting to get into Clojure at this point and if I had be
smarter, more grounded and more confident, I would have pursued this
opportunity and everything probably would have worked out.  After all,
Clojure was based on Java and it would have been a great opportunity
for me.  However, I was shortsighted and terribly hurt by this point,
feeling almost like an abused dog.

I tried to start working on [Oscillate](http://oscil.io) again --
remember that amazing music startup I was telling you about?  Just one
of the best ideas I've had and certainly one of the most fun.  I went
to [Denver Startup Week](http://www.denverstartupweek.org/) in
September 2013 and tried finding investors, but I didn't have an MVP.
The business idea was very difficult to articlulate & validate to
people who didn't have very much music production experience.  I
networked with a lot of business guys and Ruby developers there.

In October 2013, unbeknownst to me, a high profile Ruby developer and
the founder of the GroupMe messaging service founded
[Splice](http://splice.com).  Splice is pretty much exactly what I
wanted Oscillate to be -- so that's a little depressing.  And I didn't
hear about it until June 2014 on a Ruby Rogues podcast.  Needless to
say, I was not pleased.  However, **some ideas are just fated to be**
and I didn't act fast enough.  These are the best ideas by the way --
ideas so good, there's no way that someone's not going to build it.

I should have started on Oscillate in 2012, immediately!  However, I
just didn't have the support around me that I needed at that time.
And I never really have been able to time everything right -- to get
the opportunity and resources set to roll at just the right time.

#### I'm seriously being overlooked here.

### There's more to this story

Including what happened after I had to move out of Boulder.
Seriously, it's a bat-shit insane story -- the $#@!'ing craziest thing
that EVER happened to me.  It'd be funny if it wasn't true.  But I'll
have to include that in another post.
