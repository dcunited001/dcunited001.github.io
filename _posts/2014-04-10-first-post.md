**Update:** This is now using Jekyll & Ruby instead of LinemanJS

This is a blog where I can boast about my technological feats.

### Static FTW

It's a *completely static* site, built using the
[Lineman](https://linemanjs.com) front-end framework.  I used the
[Lineman Blog Template](https://github.com/linemanjs/lineman-blog-template)
as a starting point and added [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to
make it shiny and responsive.  Try playing around with different
screen sizes and see how the page reacts.

### A Markdown Blog Template with Bootstrap

I also created a
[blog template](https://github.com/dcunited001/lineman-blog-bootstrap-template)
with bootstrap ready to go with a few other features as well.  That
way, I can easily create a separate blog for skating, etc.  All of my
sites will be hosted on subdomains on *xel.io* because IO domains are
$70 and I'm cheap like that.  Also, xel is a pretty generic word-stem.

Anyone with a text editor can use this blog template, writing posts in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  Well, you
might need to know a little bit about Git, DNS and hosting.  But, it's
really simple and it's static.
