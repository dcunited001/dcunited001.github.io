#### Why Anime Stimulates Me Intellectually.

This is what's going through my head when I watch TV, commercials and
movies.  Also, when I think about businesses and read articles online,
I'm considering these dimensions of the topic at hand.  I'm constantly
mulling over these points and expanding my minds understanding of
these aspects for pretty much everything.

#### &#x2605; How was this made?

#### &#x2605; How did they market this?

#### &#x2605; Who is their audience?

#### &#x2605; What inspired someone to create this?

#### &#x2605; Why are they passionate about these themes?

#### &#x2605; Why do they want these themes to be associated with their brand?

#### &#x2605; What is left out of the message?

#### &#x2605; What am I missing?

#### &#x2605; Why were these actors interested in this project?

#### &#x2605; What technology did they use to create this?

#### &#x2605; What projects are eclipsed by this project?

#### &#x2605; Why did they choose that location or setting?

#### &#x2605; Why is the english voice acting so bad? Is that just inherent in the American voice acting industry? lulz..

### Concept => Manga => Anime

Some aren't very familiar with the production process for anime.  It
starts out as a concept.  Maybe it's a project that someone has been
working on for years.  Maybe it's a mixture of failed projects and
only came together as several talented people decided to work
together.

Regardless, the work progresses from concept to manga, only becoming
anime after it's been vetted twice.  It's not easy for your work to
become manga, but the barrier to entry for a work to proceed from
concept to manga is very small.  This is because it doesn't take too
much investment to get the project started, in comparison to a major
motion picture or a comic book in the US.

### Kanban and The Lean Startup

Here's where the parallels to the Lean Startup process begin.  An idea
is fleshed out as quickly as possible.  Avid readers and passionate
fans are able to vet the work almost immediately.  The content is
published periodically, in magazines that contain lots of various
mangas.  Because the content reaches such a niche, passionate audience
so fast, these *otaku* are able to vet new series.

![The Lean Startup](/img/posts/2015-01-27-lean-kanban-and-anime/lean-startup.jpg)

This process allows the creators to respond to their *biggest, most
passionate fans* **as the series is being conceptualized**.  This
means the writers can make subtle changes to their character
development, to their scenearios, themes and plot lines as the series
is being written.  While this process is not exactly new -- much 18th
century english literature was produced periodically -- in today's
literature world it is best exemplified in anime.

The Lean Startup drew inspiration from Kanban, a design &
manufacturing methodology originally popularized in Japan. Companies
would focus on getting products to market as quickly as possible and
focus on **enabling a malleable production process**.  This allowed
Japanese hardware companies to vet products, measure market demand and
remain agile.  After I spent much time this summer watching anime, I
thought more about their process and realized it closely resembled
Kanban.

This is very exciting.  Just trust me.

### Focusing on what matters.

#### Just. The. Content.

The best part of this process is that, though the works retain their
flexibility to change in subsequent media, most of the details are
locked down in the manga.  This is the most flexible step of the
process and it is incredibly simple.  Most manga is black and white.
There's no special effects to worry about, nor massive teams to manage
with even larger budgets.

Instead of focusing on all that without knowing whether or not people
will invest in your work, the artists are able to produce original
work with few restraints on creativity.  Even better, this lightweight
flexible process doesn't change much after the work is vetted and it
becomes anime: it's still cheap to produce.  And while it might not
cost much to produce, *it is rich in what matters most to literature &
entertainment.*

### Three Dimensional Characters in 2D

The proportion of time & effort spent on imagining characters, themes,
plot twists and scenarios is maximized, while what makes American
media generic is left out.  For example, the artists won't be limited
with special effects production cost or time because all they have to
do is draw.  So the content is not restricted by arbitrary limitations
imposed by budgets and resources.

One of the best aspects of anime are the characters.  If you pay close
attention, you'll notice that they are not just what they seem on the
surface.  There's something deeper to them.  In the best work, you can
notice that someone spent a lot of time thinking about this
character's motivations and emotions, even though they're just
animated.

### [Aldnoah Zero](http://www.hulu.com/aldnoahzero)'s Chess Scene

The scenarios are well thought out as well.  In the most recent
episode of [Aldnoah Zero](http://www.hulu.com/aldnoahzero), one of my
favorite simulcast anime's at the moment, there's a great chess scene
that only lasts a minute.  If you haven't seen the show yet, watch it
from the beginning -- otherwise, you'll ruin the plot for yourself!
However, it's in Season 2, Episode 15 and if you don't pay attention,
you'll miss it.

Two of the characters are playing chess on a table-computer, similar
to a Microsoft Surface.  The chess board display is powered off
initially and the characters are just calling out moves, like Knight
D4, etc.  In one of the first moves, you hear that Inaho loses his
Queen to Magbaraedge's King.  If you've played chess, then you know
that scenario won't arise very often, which is what clued me in to pay
more attention to the scene.  You would almost have to intentionally
do this, so I wondered if Magbaraedge had lost her queen yet, but the
display was still powered off.

Magbaraedge responds.  Then Inaho moves again.  They play a few moves,
then they power the display and you can see the board.  Magbaraedge
indeed still has her queen, but Inaho has been mostly keeping her in
check.  However, he opts to make another risky move, where he chooses
to allow Magbaraedge out of check.  This move confused me
significantly, as Inaho had several safe moves available that would
keep her in check.  Instead he moves his bishop from behind his ranks
to behind her pawns.  It does not put additional pressure on her
pieces.

At this point, it's important to also note that her King was also out
in front of her pawns, near G5.  It took me a few minutes to realize
why he made this move: he gave up the check on her King in order to
cut of the King from retreat.  He was playing the long game and slowly
cutting off her options.

It was about this time when I started looking at how Inaho stacked his
pieces: each of his Bishop/Knight/Rook pieces in play in the center of
the board were backing up at least two other pieces **and** pressuring
her pieces.  His pawns were all diagonal and backing up his pieces in
the center.  Her pieces were not so well structured.

It turns out this scene was very important in order to cast light on
other events in the episode.  Best episode so far in a stellar series.
This scene is amazing because it reveals the forethought placed into a
seemingly simple scene.  After all, it mostly took just a minute or
two, but it took me ten minutes or more to watch, rewatch and reflect.

How did the producer's come up with such a great scene?  I suspect
that a few of the artists were chess players and perhaps played chess
games just to come up with the scene.  Or maybe even searched through
famous games to find one that helped accentuate the developments in
the episode.  Regardless, it's an amazing level of detail for
something that may have been overlooked by many viewers.

### Marketing and Negotiation Tactics in Log Horizon

Another series I'm currently watching is Log Horizon.  It's pretty
good so far.  I'm not sure why it took me so long to start watching
it.  It involves players getting stuck inside an MMORPG game.  I
haven't finished watching Sword Art Online and while both series are
very good, these virtual world stories just didn't immediately appeal
to me for some reason.

In [S1E7](http://www.hulu.com/watch/573389#i0,p1,d0), one group of
players has discovered how to make real food that actually has a taste
in the world, whereas most of the virtual food is tasteless.  They
also have a need to make a lot of money, so they pull together and
decide to launch a restaurant business.  The episode is mostly about
how they market their business, protect intellectual property (the
means of making tasty food), estimate profits, and discuss pursuing
investment from the three biggest merchant guilds in Akihabara.
Again, there's a surprising level of depth behind the decisions
characters make and it exposes their thought process to you.

In the next episode,
[S1E8](http://www.hulu.com/watch/575971#i0,p7,d0), the same group of
players begins deliberation with the merchant guilds and the episode
deals with negotiation tactics, a subject with many subtleties and
paradoxes.  For example, you need to withhold information, but be
honest with your partners at the same time, while balancing that with
your partners' motivation for success.  There are a lot of mistakes
you could make and you not only have to understand the reasoning
behind negotiation tactics, but your team needs to be able to pull it
off too.  If someone on your team is a weak link, they could ruin it
by unintentionally disclosing information.  The main character
skillfully leads his other capable team members through the
negotiations and they develop a beneficial partnership with said
merchant guilds.

### Intellectual Content

These are the kinds of intelligent subjects and themes anime shows
seem to be able pull off -- in a fantasy world setting, no less --
while remaining entertaining.  Not exactly the go to source of
information for negotiation tactics, but still very thought provoking
if you're interested in it.  Or perhaps an episode like this will
introduce you to thinking about subjects like these.

And I haven't even touched on the quality of sci-fi material in Anime.
Shows like [Ghost in the Shell](http://www.hulu.com/watch/371717) and
[Lain](http://www.hulu.com/serial-experiments-lain) are classics.
They explore extremely deep themes regarding the impact technology
would have on our lives.  Ghost in the Shell originally came out in
1995, but has only become more relevant in 20 years, due to the
insightful manner in which technology was portrayed.  The best works
are timeless: they gain meaning with age, but they always manage to
stay relevant.

### Not Too Short, Not Too Long, Just Right

If a TV show was four or five episodes long would you emotionally
invest yourself in the characters?  How about a movie?  That's about
the same length right?  You simply can't accomplish in a movie what
you can in a TV series.  Some movies around 3 hours actually do manage
to do well with this.  If you notice, the works that win Oscars are
usually around this length.

You could argue that a trilogy like Lord of the Rings has more play
time.  Yes, but as a movie being released in theaters, it takes too
long to produce: 3 to 10 years.  That kind of production time would
have negatively impacted the reception of the Harry Potter movies.
Usually long running book series like that can't be transitioned to
film without sacrificing content.

You'll notice most anime shows only last one or two seasons, besides
the mainstream ones like Hunter x Hunter or Naruto, which I haven't
watched yet, mostly because I don't want to commit myself to watching
hundreds of episodes.  The pacing is crucial to anime and this length
helps maintain pace for the show so that it remains exciting.  Also,
this length is perfect because the shows always end on a high note, in
terms of quality.  You know, like Seinfeld -- they might be
successful, but they know to stop when they're ahead.  After about 25
episodes, you get the feeling that you've gotten to know the
characters and you've seen how they developed through the series.

### From Light Novels and Visual Novels to Anime

Spending a lot of time watching anime this summer got me thinking a
lot about how this content is produced.  I've even got a few scenarios
I'd like to combine for an epic sci-fi story.  However, I think a
video game would be the best setting for this. I doubt I'll ever get
around to it.  It's set slightly in the future (20 to 50 years) and
deals with an version of reality similar to our own, but one that will
likely never occur because of certain alternate developments in
technology.

It's also important to note that there are other starting points for
anime, not just manga.  A lot of series start out as Light Novels,
such as Tokyo Ravens.  A lot of particularly good stories start off as
Visual Novels, such as Fate: Stay Night.  However, you notice that
these mediums still place the focus on characters and story.

By the way, I highly recommend
[Fate: Zero](http://www.hulu.com/fatezero) and
[Fate: Unlimited Blade Works](http://www.hulu.com/fatestay-night-unlimited-blade-works).
I'd recommend watching Fate: Zero first.  Fate: Stay Night is also
good, but 10 years old. It was the first anime produced for the
series, but the series' original animation may turn some people off.
Fate: UBW is mostly the same story, but also completely different.
These stories started off as Visual Novels, similar to RPG's like
Final Fantasy, but with more of a focus on choosing your own
adventure. Because of this, they have mutliple storylines, adding an
extra dimension of depth that is impossible to reproduce in anime. I
really like these stories because they remind me of my favorite RPG's
[Chrono Trigger](http://goodmorningcrono.com/) and
[Chrono Cross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Cross).  However,
these anime's based on visual novels don't completely translate to the
screen.

### Retelling A New Story

I like the idea of iterating on the same story and producing similar
versions, similar to how the Legend of Zelda series always takes you
to a different version of the world.  This keeps things interesting
and offers new developments.  This occurs occasionally in western
literature, but mostly older stuff and sometimes it's not officially
the same story.  For example, Romeo and Juliet is based on another
story with the same title and it's very similar, or so I'm told.  This
idea of retelling the same story in various ways seems to occur a lot
in Eastern media.

Some people get very offended when details in a story are changed or
altered across different media or when a series is rebooted.  However,
I think this is one of the greatest strenths of transitioning from
manga to anime.  Usually most of the changes aren't significant, but
occasionally they are.  This can occasionally be negative, as most
fans responded poorly to changes in story for Black Lagoon: Roberta's
Blood Trail.  But IMO, it seems that the anime is the more polished,
final vision of these manga.

This is just another way that anime ends up being more polished.  I
would bet that American media would be better if it followed some of
the same process, jumping from Comics to TV.  You could even
transition from comics to live action and I think that would work.
Obviously, this occurs in a lot of cases, but that's not the
intention; it just so happens that the comic book would be profitable
to produce as a TV show or movie.  However, I've heard that the US
comic industry chokes out competition and that it's very difficult for
independent stories to get picked up.

### Cosplaying FTW

I'm starting to get very interested in Cosplay as well.  It seems like
a great hobby to pick up that would not only introduce you to many
materials design techniques, but it would also walk you through the
creative process of pursuing a project from inception to design to
realization.  I'm sure it's extremely competitive, but it seems like a
lot of fun.  Plus, I mean, how can you not? LOL
