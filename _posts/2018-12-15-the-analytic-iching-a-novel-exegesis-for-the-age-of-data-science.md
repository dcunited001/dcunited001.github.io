<a name="the-essence-of-things" />

# [The Essence of Things](#the-essence-of-things)

What is change, without state? What is the meaning of state, without
change? What is the meaning of either, without time? What phenomena
can be seen as constant without the possibility of change? Without the
possibility of time or sequence? To this end, change provides
perspective.

<a name="the-three-yi" />

### [The Three Yi](#the-three-yi)

#### TODO: State (yijing)

#### TODO: Change (yijing)

#### TODO: Essence (yijing)

Within the three yi lays the definition of the differential operator;
in simpler terms: the derivative. This much is made plain, yet
furthermore, given some familiarity with linear operators, you may
find that between the preservation of state and change, the
differential operator hides the essence of linear systems: the fourier
operator is also linear.

`d(F(x)) = F(d(x))` -- this equality *must* hold for linear equations;
this is essentially the definition of the differential operator, a
linear operator.

But *also* `d(FFT(F(x))) = FFT(d(F(x)))`!!!

Even if you don't immediately comprehend this, it is well worth the
thought to consider how magical these simple statements are! They
describe *profound* preservation of equilibrium, where the *essence*
is found in all the relationships between `d(.)`, `F(x)`, `FFT(.)` and
most critically `=`.

Thence, I posit that the Three Yi's philosophies of state, change and
essence encode not simply the differential operator, but also it's
linear interchange with that of the fourier operator. All linear
systems must also be considered spectrally, but in doing so, one finds
that any spectral valuation of linear equations must also preserve
connections to the differential spectral valuations. Mathematically,
this is a symbolically derived definition of essence.

#### The [Spectral] Convolution Theorum:

![The Spectral Convolution
Theorum](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/spectral-convolution-theorum.jpg)

If state, change and [spectral] essence are three classes of analysis
methods for studying a system's mechanics and dynamics, then a
suitable next step is the [convolution
theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem), which
extracts resolution from systems by recursively evaluating their
discrete spectralization. The process of convolution, applied to
spectral data of increasing resolution, does not stand alone as its
own class, but should be considered a tool within the Yi realm of
essence.

### [What Is Knowledge of Dependent Origination Without Applied Awareness of Phenomena?](#what-is-knowledge-of-dependent-origination-without-applied-awareness-of-phenomena)

By stuyding the I Ching, one arrives at tools and methods to
analytically assess phenomena. Because such methods are fundamentally
analytically, the insights and extrapolations derived thereof do not
necessarily depend on the inner workings of the phenomena, their
mechanics and interacting dynamics. Instead these analytic tools allow
for introspection of phenomena in a manner completely disconnected
from their mechanics. Understanding this is equivalent to
understanding *why* simple machine learning algorithms work in the way
they do, usually without requiring any knowledge of the systems they
analyze and predict. An algorithm to classify handwritten digits does
not necessarily require any knowledge of handwritten digits.

Phenomenologically, to what does [dependent
origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratītyasamutpāda) depend
upon? As a chemical oracle once *experienced* unto me at the climax of
a Lotus show, dependent origination is dependent upon itself; all
other phenomena can trace their origination to dependent origination.

#### The Twelve Nidanas of Pratītyasamutpāda, Dependent Origination

![The Twelve Nidanas of Pratītyasamutpāda](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/twelve-nidanas.jpg)

To what do we owe comprehension of the true essence of things? To
state and to change, which both together reveal the true essence of
phenomena. Without one, the other is meaningless; without both, we can
never know the true essence of things. The true constancy of
phenomenona can only be revealed to us in the ways dynamics are bound
to laws of natural philosophy.

<a name="the-analytic-i-ching" />

# [The Analytic I Ching](#the-analytic-i-ching)

The I Ching resounds along with the most beautiful philosophical ideas
my mind has considered. It's the combinatorial exploration of
noo-space, presenting my mind with random permutations of narrative
metatypes, parameterized by random images. Each hexagram's lines can
be reinterpreted analytically, in terms of physics and math metaphors,
to eloquent explain what the wisest among humanity has always known
known in terms the rationalists of modernity can only know with
confidence in our era.

<a name="sociophysical-phenomena-in-a-bronze-age-encyclopedia-of-natural-philosophy" />

### [Sociophysical Phenomena in a Bronze Age Encyclopedia of Natural Philosophy](#sociophysical-phenomena-in-a-bronze-age-encyclopedia-of-natural-philosophy)

The I Ching is a Bronze Age compendium of *social physics* in terms of
natural philosophy. Through this lens, one can see what I call the
Analytic I Ching: each hexagram captures a method of analyzing a
situation. Such methods can be symbolized and logically proven with
rigor acceptable to rationalists, yes. This is what western thought
has given us with logic, science and math. But further, these same
concepts can be felt via exploration of purely natural phenomena.

<a name="why-couldnt-vector-calculus-be-more-relatable" />

### [Why Couldn't Vector Calculus Be More Relatable?](#why-couldnt-vector-calculus-be-more-relatable)

What are the operators of vector calculus? The Gradient? The
Laplacian? They are morphemes in the universal language of math? How
universal is that language, *truly?* Are these merely applicable to
science, math and physics? No doubt, these operators and other
mathematic phonemes are invaluable tools for expansion of the mind's
abilities: to coordinate; to plan; to predict; to define. But can they
be explained to a five year-old?

Einstein *mathematically* proved the existence of the atom after
eureka revealed proof unto him upon observing the brownian motion of
sugar dissolving into his cup of coffee. What was so special about
that cup of coffee?

> What is the Laplacian? It is the *magnitude of change* over space,
> across time, where the change is the gradient -- or the derivative,
> essentially. See? That's not so bad.

Why couldn't your grandmother understand the Laplacian? Can an average
physicist -- whose mind entertains the possibilities of [Helmholtz's
theorums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz%27s_theorems) as
applied to equilibria of vortices and higher-order surfaces in an
ideal fluid -- ever understand how the very same theorums are applied
to social physics? Of course, but to what degree?  This is the beauty
of an analytic interpretation of the I Ching: metaphors of purely
natural philosophy can allow both a wise, but uneducated grandmother
and an average physicist to communicate powerful explanations of
social dynamics using a language of purely natural phenomena.

<a name="art-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly" />

### [Art: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly](#art-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly)

The below photoshopped picture's egregrious violations of the
preservation of quantities in vorticies insults the memory of
Helmholtz. In more simple terms: the photo *looks* fake, but how can
one intuitively describe *how* it is definitively fake without
inspecting the pixels for evidence of photoshopping? It's because it
defies the human intuition for natural philosophy. We do not need
advanced symbolic manipulation of maths and logic to understand that
this photo is fake.

#### Helmholtz's Three Laws Are Demonstrated By Every Vape Video On Youtube

![Smoke Rings](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/smoke-rings.jpg)

Again ... Why? Because a visual representation of phenomena, whether
artistic or photographic, in its depiction of natural phenomena, must
reflect the preservation of equilibrium. Otherwise it *looks*
fake. This is the difference between bad lighting and good lighting in
paintings. This is the difference between bad waves and good waves in
Japanese woodblock prints.

![The Great Wave, a Japanese Woodblock Print](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/the-great-wave.jpg)

The progenitors and authors of I Ching *assumed* that sociophysical
mechanics and dynamics mimicked those found in the natural world. This
coupling that bounds social phenomena to reflect physical phenomena is
how the child, whose mind has been attuned to the accurate perception
of natural and social phenomena, can see that the emporer of Hans
Christian Andersen's wears no clothes: the near-equilibrium of social
physics is starkly violated. As a work of natural philosophy, the I
Ching informed ancient China of social physics by generating random
images of metaphor to natural phenomena.

![](leibniz-iching.jpg)

Pictured above are the famous notes on I Ching gifted to Gottfried
Leibniz. Hexagrams 1, 2, 11, and 12 are located in the four corners of
the grid. Within the I Ching, these four hexagrams form a microcosm
that parallels the four.

  - the receptive: for the waves rolling in, the receptive are the
    forces acting on each to deconstruct their form and to eventually
    pull them back out to sea.
  - peace: is like the intersection between the shore and the waves

<a name="rationalize-your-exegesis" />

# [Rationalize Your Exegesis](#rationalize-your-exegesis)

The exegesis herein is motivated by a visual reconstruction of
inductive combinations of potential narratives implied by
semiotics. The exegesis, or the motivation and modus operandi of
interpretation, further reduces the induced possibilities by
constraining interpretation with Wilhelm's interpretation of the text,
in most areas. There are some lines where I feel that Wilhelm skipped
over the proper interpretation, but as of yet, I am not operating with
his same level of comprehension of Chinese culture.

<a name="timeless-writing-assumes-all-possible-integrpretations" />

### [Timeless Writing Assumes All Possible Interpretations](#timeless-writing-assumes-all-possible-interpretations)

When writing for an audience thousands of years in the future, meaning
is most effectively preserved by encoding it semiotically into images,
whose relevance and persistence is intended to be re-emulated in the
future, not by the ephemeral meaning of words, but by the implicit
relevance of the images those words inspire in the reader. It is only
after meditating on a Hexagram for a day or so that I feel that I
arrive at the proper intent. When interpreting such monumental works
of religion -- or when writing your own great work of literature -- it
is critical to understand the motivation behind transcending
limitations of language in this way.

<a name="the-i-ching-stands-alone" />

### [The I Ching Stands Alone!](#the-i-ching-stands-alone)

Therefore, you don't write more, you write less! You don't assume
there can be a most proper interpretation, you assume the work will be
constantly reinterpreted; instead you encode the form of the message
into a document such that most future reinterpretations can decode and
reconstruct such authenticity of message without relying on external
sources of information.  You don't rely on transient phenomena; the
degree of ephemerality of artificial phenomena signfies the likelihood
a proper interpretation will perish. All one must do to understand
timelessness is to read Nassim Taleb's article [The future will not be
cool](https://www.salon.com/2012/12/01/nassim_nicholas_taleb_the_future_will_not_be_cool/)
and one will realize: to captivate meaning and to capture
timelessness, one relies on timeless symbols:

> The food will be prepared using a very archaic technology (fire),
> with the aid of kitchen tools and implements that have not changed
> since the Romans (except in the quality of some of the metals
> used). I will be sitting on an (at least) three-thousand-year-old
> device commonly known as the chair (which will be, if anything, less
> ornate that its majestic Egyptian ancestor). And I will be not be
> repairing to the restaurant with the aid of a flying motorcycle. I
> will be walking or, if late, using a cab from a century-old
> technology, driven by an immigrant—immigrants were driving cabs in
> Paris a century ago (Russian aristocrats), same as in Berlin and
> Stockholm (Iraqis and Kurdish refugees), Washington, D.C. (Ethiopian
> postdoc students), Los Angeles (musically oriented Armenians), and
> New York (multinationals) today.

The most effective writing assumes all interpretations are valid and,
line by line, places constraints on the space of interpretations. By
limiting the set of symbols and morphemes employed, this guarantees
that the proper interpretation will be reinforced by the apparent
spectral harmony of a subset of semantic interpretations made manifest
to the well-attuned reader.

I realize that Chinese authors of the I Ching -- and indeed the
authors of whatever body of divinatory work preceeded the I Ching --
did not have the modern era's profiency with symbolic manipulation of
math and physics. However, I truly believe they found much the same
form and order in nature to be rediscovered by the West's
proto-Rationalists in the Renaissance.

# [The Epitomization of Design Imperatives Motivating the Shaman's Method](#the-epitomization-of-design-imperatives-motivating-the-shamans-method)

With the Analytic I Ching, there are two objectives whose (solution) I
hope to intertwine. First, I wish to reinterpret the I Ching in the
image of moreso modern analytic tools. Second, I hope this results in
divination readings that are profound convolutions of these analytic
tools, providing value to both the average person looking for a more
rigorous set of abstractions by which to examine their query to the
Iching *and* as a comprehensive set of analytic tools useful data
scientists.

<a name="a-book-pitch-no-earthly-publishers-would-entertain" />

### [A Book Pitch No Earthly Publishers Would Entertain](#a-book-pitch-no-earthly-publishers-would-entertain)

I hope to proceed towards this second objective in the same spirit as
the thesis of Hill's piece [Masters of Reality: The Trances and
Healing Powers of
Shamans](https://aeon.co/essays/why-did-shamanism-evolve-in-societies-all-around-the-globe?fbclid=IwAR16_GZguvFtz2sxiyrhbDjr1KZcQZwTdEISkHx5qWkGfbvU_-q6brX7l9c).
In this article, shamans are described as having stumbled into reverse
engineering the mind's neural networks purely by accident. Thereby,
the altered consciousness of trance-states allow the shaman to extract
an immense amount of utility by leveraging intuition of the mind and
of phenomena in tandem with exploratory divination.

Here are three or four books I'd love to write:

#### (1) The Speed of Thought

#### (2) The Analytic I Ching,

#### (3) A Collection of [Revised] Essays,

#### (4) Who Knows?

Still, even now, no one takes me seriously. And I mean [almost] *no
person on the planet* takes me seriously. People are simple -- they
recognize labels and that is mostly all. They do not know labels. When
they want to ascertain the extent and novelty of someone's
internalized epistemic structures, they merely look at someone's
academic degrees. That is all. This leaves me with *nothing* and
certainly without the respect I deserve.

<a name="the-trance-state-a-visual-emulation-whereby-one-viserally-experiences-the-metaphysical" />

### [The Trance State: A Visual Emulation Whereby One Viscerally Experiences The Metaphysical](#the-trance-state-a-visual-emulation-whereby-one-viserally-experiences-the-metaphysical)

The experience of the spiritual is the apprehension of eternal,
unchanging metaphysical forms as they manifest themselves in the
material plane. To me, these are like Kant's noumena that can't be
known to exist nor to not exist. They emanate into the material world
and are the underlying monadic patterns which frame dynamics of
informational phenomena. To apprehend the true nature of these
metaphysical forms as they appear to influence causal flow of events
is to be in tune with the spiritual. If various methods of shamanism
can repeatedly evoke visceral experiences to bring you closer to
understanding of these forms as they influence the the world around
you, then there is no need for a supernatural connection. Instead, the
spiritual experience can be explained as purely the mind's experience
of purely informational mechanics within itself -- which can include
the experience of information that, while the mind's analytic systems
are never capable of fully ingesting, still result in transformative
structural changes to the psyche. These purely informational mechanics
are mapped to the aforementioned noumena-like forms, which are not
only eternally unchanging, but universal throughout space and
time. while they are composed of ineffable "monadic substances", the
same eternal forms can be tapped into by *any consciousness* and *any
information-processing entity*, without any need for supernatural
mechanics -- whether or not those exist is perhaps another
question. this is essentially no different than the the Tao or
Leibniz's Monad. to me, the shaman's trance and spiritual experiences
are visceral experiences in the minds of those who are intimately in
tune with the nature of the eternal. it is projected to the mind as a
visceral experience where archetypes of the eternal are witnessed by
the shaman, who must then make sense of what was seen.

<a name="the-shamans-method-is-experiential-divination-by-reverse-engineering-the-minds-analytic-systems" />

### [The Shaman's Method is Experiential Divination By Reverse Engineering The Mind's Analytic Systems](#the-shamans-method-is-experiential-divination-by-reverse-engineering-the-minds-analytic-systems)

So, shamanism's altered states of consciousness are essentially a
vehicle for experiential divination, where the mind experiences the
combinated elements of narrative parameterized by archetypal images. I
Ching is divination by bibliomancy, where images from natural
philosophy provide random points of reference that the I Ching
personified posits as explanation for the situation described by the
*querent*. If one simply substitutes these images from natural
philosophy with the interpreted analytic tools I believe the hexagrams
represent, then one arrives at a more modern revision of the
divinatory vehicle that I believe the I Ching was intended to be.

If one's perception of a situation is imagined as a point in an
analytic hyperplane, and the I Ching's explanation of a query is
imagined as another point in along that hyperplane, then the true
value of divination is found by evaluating all the possible paths that
connect those two points. TODO: See [below](#below) for a better
explanation of In my opinion, there is little value in accepting the
random point the I Ching yields to the querent as a definitively true
message. It is instead the dissonance between the querent's perception
of their situation and the I Ching's projection perception of the same
situtation: these are the two points and their dissonance is evaluated
by constructing paths to explain the difference between them. Since
the points returned by the I Ching or some other divinatory system are
effectively random, then they are completely disconnected from all the
inherent biases that humans have. This deshrouds a person from their
biases and thereby divination may disrupt the hold that the
unconscious or illusion have over a person.

<a name="your-task-complete-the-circumstantial-circuits-of-explanation" />

### [Your Task: Complete The Circumstantial Circuit(s) Of Explanation](#your-task-complete-the-circumstantial-circuits-of-explanation)

In this way, the I Ching is tooling for toying with the
hyper-parameters of the mind's neural network learning systems; it
presents the mind with an unconsciously arranged smattering of images
and archtypes. Hereby, the I Ching provides random fodder to expand
with combinatorially inductive reasoning, to be reduced by abductive
and deductive methods. If such fodder corresponds to a truly universal
mapping of the phenomena and the dynamics of human experience, then
there is no social force that can captivate my awareness by persisting
my unconsciousness to various phenomena, whereby the I Ching is my
divinatory escape from a socially imposed prison of unconsciousness!

This requires a universal covering, which is why the statistical
mechanics of the I Ching is paramount. It's yarrow sticks method for
sampling a true uniform distribution of random numbers. If this
corresponds to a truly uniform covering of phenomena and dynamics,
then it truly acts as a set of keys to unlock any and every potential
circumstance of social captivity.

<a name="what-is-a-hexagram-analytically" />

# [What Is A Hexagram, Analytically?](#what-is-a-hexagram-analytically)

Note: some creativity may be required to assemble the parts
included. Referring to the Wilhelm-Baynes text should complete the
circuit, if one finds pieces missing.

### [Hexagram 5 Delineates a Taxonomy of Local Minima, Not Simply "Waiting"](#hexagram-5-dilineates-a-taxonomy-of-local-minima-not-simply-waiting)

Each line in the fifth hexagram covers a different species of local
minima in optimization problems. Waiting is what happens when humans
who experience sociophysical local minima are forced to deal with an
externally imposed lack of progress. The kinds of situations where
there one perceives some "lack of progress" can be destructured into a
mathematic model, where the same kind of analytic hyperplane of
solution-space used in machine learning algorithms forms the basis of
a space. One's motion in the social situation can be plotted as a path
in this analytic hyperplane.

- TODO: assemble!

![Pictures of notes from Hexagram 5]()

There is a taxonomy of local minima that describes ALL of the species
of minima that can be encountered: the first five lines of Hexagram 5
enumerates ALL of these minima types. The Theorema EgregumThere is
the meadow, a flat space, which is a symbol that recurs again and
again in the I Ching. This is a space of comfort; nothing is to be
challenged, but "crossing the great water" requires moving oneself out
of a comfort zone, where perhaps one encounters more disadvantaged
situations. There is the pit in the fourth line, a relatively global
minima. There is the place of "meat and drink" in the fifth line,
which describes a higher local minima encountered after climbing out
of the Pit. Finally, in the sixth line, how does one escape all of
these traps? It is by encountering three guests who are traversing the
same space: this is analogous to parallelized methods for accelerating
training of machine-learning algorithms. These three guests have
explored the contours of the adjacent hyperplane: the bring to you
information about how to escape your local minima.

Imagining higher dimensions is easier if you imagine the space in
radial terms, not simply cartesian terms... In this 4D or 5D space,
rotate your perspective. What's different?

The final message in "Waiting" is that by leveraging the experience of
other people -- each their own process in a massive [Boltzmann
Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine) -- we can
more efficiently come to know the collective contours of society's
collective analytical hyperplane. Though you've known your own
descent and can chart the depths you know, there are others who have
been deeper and carry with them knowledge they've gained while
navigating the depths. You will not know from whom to expect this
re-orientation but you must expect it to inquire about these three
guests' journey when you do meet them.

#### From the paper, Dynamic Boltzmann Machines

![Dynamic Boltzmann Machines](/img/posts/2018-12-10/the-analytic-i-ching/boltzmann-evolution.jpg)

[I've written
before](/posts/2018-03-04-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity.html#boltzmanns-distribution-a-generalized-heat-equation),
the Boltzmann Machine's profoundly generalized conception of
energy. Understanding the concept of Physical Energy, generalized to
abstract scenarios, is something that would benefit every Western
Rationalist to understand. In machine learning, there are
generalizable methods for convex/concave optimization wherein many
process explore a space in parallel. In a Boltzman Machine, each
process has its own theta-weights and, as iterations of the algorithm
runs, then subsequent iterations allocate more effort to regions of
the space with more concavities. Many of the same approaches involving
energy and entropy that Boltzmann introduced to model thermodynamics
are applied to higher-order energy types. For my own purposes in
distinguishing this from physical energy: these I have named energies,
plural. The concept of "Energies" is employed repeatedly in biophysics
and social physics. Any and every quantity that is statistically
distributed over a space can be conceptualized as a higher-order
energy, which can be braided together with the concept of Dirichley
energy.

We are all particles in the collective potential distributions of a
sociophysical [ensemble]() of potential distributions: each
sociophysical particle has its own path unfolding, but society,
collectively, relevates its state, unfolding change and essence
through our inference of sociophysical ensemble's nature. An ensemble,
in physics is the a collection of potential statistical mechanical
distributions, delineating upon some parameters. Sociophysical
ensembles yield distributions of social particles and social dyanmics
that are not the composition of dilineated physical attributes, but
instead are ensembles whose distributions are arranged along
ontological space in terms of each distribution's ontological
metatypes.

There is a brilliant theorum of holes in space called
[Gauss-Bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss–Bonnet_theorem). Just
like Gauss's [Theorema
Egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium) correlates
restrictions on the space of functions to elicit guarantees of
curvature, the theorum of Gauss-Bonnet places elicits similar
constraints for how the Euler Characteristic must behave, given the
curvature of space or of surfaces. There is equilibrium in all
curvature: this is what the Theorema Egregia tells us. Wherever there
is an increase, if continuity constraints are to be maintained, there
must be corresponding decrease. However, in the study of algebraic
topology, Gauss-Bonnet is similar, but applies to the manisfestation
of holes in n-dimensional shapes. This theorum correlates changes in
Euler Characteristic to necessitate compensating chagnes in the
surface curvature to the need to average the values of Euler
Characteristic when considering the surfaces of manifolds,
differentially.

- maxima/minima along the hyperplane (which is like a higher-order
  cost function of theta-weight configurations of the cost function)
  in high-dimensional spaces yield regions that are inaccessible to
  any configuration of theta-weights.  these regions are, to the
  hyperplane, what white-holes are to black holes. this is why there
  are major topological connections to be found in optimizing the
  hyperparameters for machine learning.

Even the volume of spacetime *is* a surface: a 3D surface in a 4D
volume. This is perhaps more correctly considered as [2,1]-D surfaces
in a [3,1]-D volume, three dimensions of space and one of time. This
is why Gauss-Bonnet is relevent to cosmology and astronomy: the
singularities of black holes are the "holes" in spacetime and
therefore, Gauss-Bonnet applies to astronomy. Considering the
energetic consequences of the topology of spacetime -- as the surfaces
of its manifold changes topologically when hole appears where none was
before -- is fascinating. Why?  *Because equilibrium is a very special
thing.* For continuity constraints to be placed upon physical systems,
the additional constraint of energetic equilibrium results in a far
more limited space for potential system configurations.

### [Wherefore A Rough Diamond Lies Herein](#wherefore-a-rough-diamond-lies-herein)

As promised, there *is* genius in this ramble; here's the diamond in
the rough.

Just like there are applications of Gauss-Bonnet to spacetime, quantum
gravity, and even in energetic measures of [Simplicial
Complices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06549) in the work of [Oliver
Knill](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Knill%2C+O),
it has applications in considering analytic hyperplanes
topologically. If it hasn't already, [Algebraic
Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology) can
revolutionize how an analytic hyperplane is considered for clustering
algorithms. If it's computationally feasible, topologically analyzing
the hyperplane for cluster classification. Identifying a cluster's
"center of mass" and dilineating the distance of cluster members
"inverts" the hyperplane and provides a field, upon which one can
apply the familiar operators of gradiant and Laplacian. However, this
space has topological features in it's various n-dimensional surfaces
and volumes. Therefore, Gauss-Bonnet is not simply applicable, but
should also augment existing means for balancing the arrangement of
clusters and determining the optimal hyper-parameters for training the
clustering algorithm.

Ultimately, pure math remains mental masturbation until an application
becomes relevant. Fortunately, an analytic interpretation of the I
Ching is implicitly dependent on natural philosophy and on metaphors
to natural phenomena. There is no purely abstract math.

### [Hexagram 13 is About Group Cohesion in Response to Local Minima, Not Simply "Fellowship with Men"](#hexagram-13-is-about-group-cohesion-in-response-to-local-minima-not-simply-fellowship-with-men)

Hexagram 13 ends (and begins) with an allusion to the space of the
meadow. This is a flat space, where motion in any direction is
easy. But in life, we must not simply accept comfort, per se, for if
we do, the powerful will count upon our complacency. Soon, we will
find our lives at the intersection of disproportionate influences.
However, crossing the great water is a trek across many hills and
valleys. If the crossing is a group endeavor, the hills and valleys of
that analytic hyperplane may disrupt the group by altering the
incentivization structure that motivates its individuals and
subgroups.

#### Hexagram 13: 3rd and 4th Lines

> *Nine in the third place means:*
>
> He hides weapons in the thicket;
>
> He climbs the high hill in front of it.
>
> For three years he does not rise up.
>
> *Nine in the fourth place means:*
>
> He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.
>
> Good fortune.

The meaning behind the third and fourth lines is that, to avoid
insurrection from within the group and to protect the cohesion of the
group, one must foresee how the shape of the space through which the
group might travel impacts the incentives of the group's members. If
the leaders of the group do so, then any planned insurrection where
the group factionalizes and "hide weapons in the thicket" then instead
become useful examples to the rest of the group, sacrificed towards
the need for group cohesion. Optimally, the leaders of the group
foresee this and avoid it entirely: thus, when the faction climbs up
on the wall, that faction finds that they cannot attack or insurrect
without adversely impacting their own motivations. Thereby, the group
remains as one.

### [Hexagram 15 Details The Phenomena of Normification, Not Simply "Modesty"](#hexagram-15-details-the-phenomena-of-normification-not-simply-modesty)

What is modesty? In social interactions? How does one know how to
subtle tailor the presentation of action and intent to match a modest
display of values? This is accomplished by averaging qualities of
one's life experience and comparing them against society's average
expectations.

The lines of Hexagram 15, Modesty, detail phenomena, dynamics and
mechanics of norms and normification. Paradoxes arise in norms: how
does one project their beliefs and values regarding some subject when
there aren't enough data regarding that subject for society to have
formed norms and expectations?

#### Hexagram 15: 1st and 2nd Lines

> *Nine at the beginning means:*
>
> A superior man modest about his modesty
>
> May cross the great water.
>
> Good Fortune.
>
> *Six in the second place means:*
>
> Modesty that comes to expression.
>
> Perseverence brings good fortune.

In the first and second lines of Hexagram 15: before the first, no
norm existed, but after such an undertaking as the crossing of the
great water ....

# The Statistical Mechanics of I Ching

- How does the Yarrow Sticks method of sampling critically differ from
  a Tarot deck? partly because the sampling process is not a
  differential: i.e. the probabilities of the next sampled reading do
  not depend on the state of the deck of cards. Why do Vegas dealers
  *only* draw from fresh decks of cards? For similar reasons: to
  eliminate any potential differential interdependency in the values
  sampled. So, the yarrow sticks method is like sampling from a fresh
  deck of cards every time.
