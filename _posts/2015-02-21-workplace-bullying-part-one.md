#### &#x2605; Overview &#x2605; [General Strategies](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html) &#x2605; [Specific Tactics](/posts/2015-02-25-workplace-bullying-part-three.html) &#x2605; [Tools Against Bullying](/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four.html)

### No person should ever be miserable at their place of work.

> You should do what you love and love what you do.

After recently reading an Io9 article about
[handling Passive Aggressive behavior](http://io9.com/the-secrets-to-handling-passive-aggressive-people-1681127156),
I realized my definition of **Paggro** behavior was extremely limited.
I basically condidered paggro to cover **vaguebooking**, where you
post a vague status online, which everyone can see, but is clearly
targeted towards one person.  Or maybe not, who knows?

In terms of the negative & toxic behavior that passive aggressive
behavior encompasses, vaguebooking isn't really that bad.  Yes, it's
immature and an ineffective ploy for attention.  But in terms of the
manipulation possible with passive aggressive behavior, *
**vaguebooking** doesn't even break the surface*. Like who cares?
Ultimately, vaguebooking makes you look dumb.

### Every Trick in **the Book**

Yup, there really is **A BOOK**.  And here it is.  **With great power
comes great responsibility.** Some people use this book as a kind of
bible.  *$#@! those people*.  Here's a blog with a
[nice preview of the lovely teachings](http://48laws-of-power.blogspot.com/)
this book entails.  **You're going to want to buy this book and study
it.**

## 48 Laws of Power

![48 Laws of Power](/img/posts/2015-02-21-workplace-bullying-part-one/48-power.jpeg)

### This book includes such lovely gems =)

#### &#x2605; Conceal Your Intentions

#### &#x2605; Play to People's Fantasies

#### &#x2605; Create a Cult: Play on People's Need to Believe

#### &#x2605; Disdain Things You Cannot Have

#### &#x2605; Use Selective Honesty to Disarm Your Victim

#### &#x2605; Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy

#### &#x2605; Do Not Commit to Anyone

#### &#x2605; Get Others to Do the Work for You

#### &#x2605; Discover Each Man's Thumbscrew

### What great life advice!  What morals!  Am I right?  Find a man's vice or thumbscrew and really stick it to 'em

> Discovering people's vices to exploit them is something the mafia
> and organized crime has specialized in for centuries ... **Super
> happy thumbscrews! =)**

### The "Other" Problem of Evil

Now, this book can be used to manipulate people.  It contains dozens
of amoral strategies for doing so.  However, *knowledge of evil* can
be used *to fight evil* -- it's a great paradox, one that I call the
**Other Problem of Evil**, a subject for another blog post.  And
actually -- because someone who is ethical has restraints on his
behavior and someone unethical may have none -- then ethical people
are inherently more predictable.

> And thus, *from a game-theory perspective,* **unethical people
> always have the advantage.** And that's a bit depressing, isn't it?

My point is, in order to know how to fight these strategies, you have
to know them well -- and if you don't, you'll find them used against
you!  Some of them aren't so bad, but some of them are downright
dirty.

So I'm going to write a multi-part series based on what I've
experienced.  Parts of these articles could be used for evil :) No,
*I'm serious.* I'm going to provide high and low-level details on how
to do this to someone else, accompanied by generic and specific
details of what I've experienced.  Not that I'm capable of doing most
of this, since I have a conscience after all.  But, I'm going to equip
you with my experiences, so that you can prevent them from happening
to someone else.  I hope to provide others with the tools they need to
fight back!

I have one friend who mentioned she lost her job a bully in her
workplace a few months ago.  These people are everywhere and I cannot
stand it when they **make gains** from * **unethical behavior.** *

### Sun Tzu's [Art of War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War)

![Sun Tzu](/img/posts/2015-02-21-workplace-bullying-part-one/sun-tzu.jpg)

Here's another book to read and you can even find it online
[for free!](http://classics.mit.edu/Tzu/artwar.html) Read it!  It's
like three pages and I recommend reading it first, then finding a
version with commentary. Some of the most important topics in this
book are:

1. **Fight a war without fighting.** Don't openly fight battles if you
   don't have to.  No one wants to expend unnecessary energy.  Weigh
   your options.  What are they?  Can you play to your opponents
   motivations?  Find something in common instead.
2. **Know thyself and know your enemy.** By predicting behavior and
   knowing your own capabilities, you know which battles are won and
   which are lost before fighting them.  And more.
3. **Focus your energy.** Avoid wasting it and concetrate it where it
   will matter most.  Some battles are not worth winning and will
   simply drain your energy.
4. **Demoralize your opponent!** If you can convince them not to
   fight, you win.  I am emphasizing this so that you **avoid it**.

You never want find yourself demoralized by others at work.  If you do
-- you've lost.  *You've already lost;* pack up your things and go
home. And this is **definitely** a strategy you will face if you find
yourself being bullied at work.

> This person -- hopefully, not multiple people! -- will try and try
> to break your spirit.  And once they do, they have won.  Therefore,
> the true battle is within yourself.  Only once you've won the battle
> within yourself, can you hope to excel.

![Sun Tzu, too](/img/posts/2015-02-21-workplace-bullying-part-one/sun-tzu-2.jpg)

And you're going to see this over and over in life.  People are going
to try to convince you: it's not worth it, there are shinier things
out there with bigger rewards, it's going to be too hard, etc, etc.
They really just don't want to fight.  Don't give up.  At least make
things exciting.

### The Old Testament

Here's another book.  This one's chock full of shitty things shitty
people did between the years 1,000 and 100 B.C.  A lot of people point
to the Bible and say "But look at all that terrible stuff in there!!"
Yes, there are terrible things in the Bible.  They are provided as
reference -- * **so that, if you paid attention, you won't have to
experience them!** *

> **E.G.** No, you probably shouldn't sleep with the pharoah's
> wife. And even though you didn't, you better watch out -- cuz that
> b!@#$ is triflin'!  She was really just looking for a reason to burn
> you all along and she won't hesitate to !@#$ you in order to !@#$
> you.

![The Bible](/img/posts/2015-02-21-workplace-bullying-part-one/the-bible.jpg)

### **Fools** learn from their experiences -- while the **wise** learn from history

IMO, religion has a lot of offer and those who disdain it are missing
out.  However terrible they may be, having adequate knowledge of how
these situations may play out *beforehand* can be a life saver!  You
will definitely find yourself facing specific tactics, the
significance of which you will not otherwise understand until it's too
late!  You must recognize these tactics when they occur, so that you
can cast light on the motivations behind your actions and so that you
will not find the appearance of your actions manipulated!

> "Fools learn from experience. I prefer to learn from the experience
> of others." -- Otto von Bismarck

### **But Wait! That's Not All!** -- I'm also going to give you tools!

I'm going to equip you with some of the tools that you'll need to
fight back!  Generic and specific strategies you can follow to avoid
finding yourself in these situations.  Tools that I have found
invaluable myself.

### Working Class Hero

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/njG7p6CSbCU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Why am I writing about this?

How would you feel about getting another job if this has been your
experience at most positions you've held?  Neither my family nor my
friends seem to understand my reticence to return to work or my high
level of discernment in deciding my place of work.

It seems to be particularly bad in software, a field full of
incredibly intelligent people wielding event-driven scripts on the
internetz like magickz of yore.  There are incredibly fucked up things
that you can do in software particularly, in order to bog someone down
or affect their performance.  And I will describe many of these
specifc tactics in Part Two.  I'm sure **there be dragons** in other
fields too, but some of these software dragons are $#@!'ing vicious.

> "You easily make like over $50/hr and over six figures. Why don't
> you just get a job?! Just get the first job that pays you well!"

![Sad Dog](/img/posts/2015-02-21-workplace-bullying-part-one/sad-dog.jpg)

#### What does an abused dog do, when you reach out to pet it?

Well, **avoidance** is one of primary behaviors and defense mechanisms
that you'll notice in those who have been abused, physically, sexually
or, yes, even emotionally.  A child that has burned his hands a few
times learns to avoid hot stuff.  People that have been through this
will begin to confuse normal situations with those circumstances which
caused them pain.  If you've experienced a lot anxiety and repeatedly
experience negative situations, one coping behavior is to avoid those
situations.  However, in my case, * **THIS IS RUINING MY CAREER AND MY
LIFE!** * I have several jobs, where I have been unfairly pushed out,
usually due to one person.  Oh and then there's jamskating.

### Having High Functioning Autism Makes Me a Target.

And I just don't get it honestly.  And a lot of it has to do with the
fact that I have Aspergers.  Well, I guess I'm self diagnosed, so I
don't actually have legal rights in this regard -- not that I would
ever sue over this anyways.  That'd be lame and immature.  It's my
problem after all, right?  However, my symptoms and behavior lead me
to be **AN EASY TARGET**, who is **UNABLE TO APPROPRIATELY RESPOND**.

Oh, did I mention that I'm quiet and reserved?  This means that when
someone treats me unfairly at work, there's a lower probability that
other people will hear about it.  I'll get into this in Part Two, but
workplace bullies will tend to go for who they perceive as vulnerable
and likely to not fight back.

> "No consequences? **Perfect**!" -- said **every sociopath**, ever.

![Sociopath](/img/posts/2015-02-21-workplace-bullying-part-one/sociopath.jpg)

I've found that a handful of people abusing my autistic traits have
just added insult to injury, time after time.  I think of my singular
focus and unique patterns of thought as gifts that contribute to my
creativity.  Sure, sometimes it's harder for me to connect and
establish relationships at work.  But, isn't it a bit fucked up to use
that against me, simply because it's easier to isolate me and cut me
out?  I'm sorry that I'm sometimes difficult to deal with, that I'm
quiet, that sometimes it's harder for me to read between the lines.
But, I'm honestly trying as hard as I can!

Ultimately, unfairly being pushed out of jobs has led me to:

1. **Lack of incentive to get another job.** Trust me, if you've been
   in my shoes and you've faced this over and over again, you're
   better off at peace.
2. **Lack of ability to get a new job.** Breaks in work experience in
   your resume lead you to get filtered out of a list of job
   applicants -- fast.
3. **Lack of opportunities** because I have had to move back to my
   hometown several times.  While I love my hometown, it has a
   metropolitan population of < 300,000.  Guess what?  No more
   meetups.  No job opportunities.  Not for open source software
   anyways.
4. **Disrupted relationships in my personal life**, driving me to
   depression and unnecessary anxiety.  I've moved across the country
   like 5 times, just to have to return every time, terminating any
   new relationships.  I am pushed to despair and unable to function.
   And while some of it is definitely my fault, the influence that
   others can have on your life can be catastrophic.  If everything is
   ultimately my own fault, then why would others expend so much
   energy strategically planning their behavior?  Would there be any
   point?
5. **Lack of acquired experience required for new opportunites.** I'm
   at a point where I'm seriously falling behind in my career.  And
   not for lack of talent, but because of lack of opportunities and
   direction.  I'm doing pretty well, in spite of it all.  But,
   honestly, it doesn't matter how well I excel in coding while I'm
   alone in Roanoke.  NO ONE RELEVANT IS HERE TO SEE ME SUCCEED.

### Empathetic?  OMG I have learned to appreciate you!

Most of the people I've worked with are friendly, empathetic and frank
people who genuinely have your best intentions in mind.  Maybe that
wasn't the best way to put it.  They at least consider (and
reconsider) situations from multiple perspectives, not just their own.
But honestly, I've had to deal with a few incredibly two-faced people
who almost seem *trained in the art of duplicity.* But, I've learned
that, unfortunately, you can't depend on avoiding it -- you have to
deal with it.

![Sociopathic](/img/posts/2015-02-21-workplace-bullying-part-one/sociopathy.jpg)

#### Recent studies show that up to **[1 in 25](http://www.lisawolcott.com/how-to-spot-and-handle-a-sociopath/)** people have [sociopathic](http://www.amazon.com/Sociopath-Next-Door-Martha-Stout/dp/0767915828) [tendencies](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/how-to-spot-a-sociopath-hint-it-could-be-you.html).

There is almost always **that one guy** and I don't get it.  The
person I'm talking about usually underperforms at their actual job --
but they excel at manipulating people!  They may lack real talent,
**but they won't hesitate to take credit for yours.** To this person,
it's all about the **meta-game.** This is the most frustrating part:
they distort all your energy and talent, just to turn it against you!
You work hard, you try harder -- you even work after hours, logging
50+ hours per week.  And **even that** gets turned against you!

> "Well, he obviously can't complete his work during the day!" -- An
> example of how a workplace bully will contort your words and actions
> to use them against you, no matter how hard you try.  And notice:
> the same guy who distracts you during the day at work *doesn't want
> you spending time working from home.*

### Some people just don't play fair.

However, as it turns out, highly competitive situations attract highly
competitive people.  In itself, this isn't actually a bad thing:
**competition is a great tool for motivating people to achieve
better!**

I thrive in competitive situations.  *It is what drives me to be
better.* I push myself to be challenged. But some people don't play
nice: they lie, they deceive, they omit, they steal credit.

I have tried to empathize with these people.  And what I've usually
found is that **they feel threatened by me.** You're just naturally
*faster, better, harder and stronger* than them.  But you're not
perfect, you have flaws they can exploit.  Flaws that seem to become
fractures when protrayed in just the right light.

### Motivations for Passive Aggressive Behavior

The **goal is to *dissociate/disguise* cause & effect between actions
& reactions in a social setting**.  This makes situations more
confusing and enables someone to cause problems which are inherently
more difficult to react to.  It becomes especially difficult for
people in positions of authority to react appropriately because the
true causes of negative situations are hidden and thus, their hands
are tied.

![Neil Tyson](/img/posts/2015-02-21-workplace-bullying-part-one/neil-tyson.jpg)

### Brief list of examples of Paggro Behavior

- **Manipulating the Audience that Witnesses Behavior:** someone may
  antagonize you 1-on-1, then act like a concerned friend in front of
  everyone else.
- **Manipulating Channels of Communication:** email, text, in person,
  phone and chatroom.  A person will purposely paint a different
  picture across different mediums of communication.
- **Willful Incompetence:** someone may agree to complete a task or
  help you out.  Not really though.  They just plan on convincing you
  to pursue inaction, so they can leave you out to dry later.
- **Play to Appearences:** they ignore the truth of actions and play
  to what *seems* to happen. They play on the fears of your managers
  and your coworkers.
- **Distorting Perceptions:** this person even goes so far as to
  control appearances -- in fact, **this** is *where their power
  lies.* They will psychoanalyze you and mine your social media
  accounts for information they can distort.  They abuse channels of
  communication to present you in the light of their choosing.  Or
  maybe they task you with a Fool's Errand.
- **Downplay Your Contributions:** this person will attempt to
  manipulate how your contributions are perceived.  They will make
  your victories seem like nothing and will draw attention to your
  failures.
- **Lead You with False Hope:** they'll play on your goals or dreams,
  promising complete bullshit that will never happen.  This is
  particularly bad in the entertainment industry.

### Examples of manipulation through false hope

> We've got some pretty big performances coming up.  We could use your
> talent, you know.  And all you have to do is stab your mentor in the
> back -- he's holding you back anyways. What the $#!@ did he ever do,
> anyways?

> Hey, how would you like that shiny new promotion?  Yes, the one with

> chestnuts for me and they're totally in the fire.  Yes, that's
> right.  You'll need to be my catspaw.  But I totally pinky swear;
> that promotion is yours.

> There's going to be a Reality TV show and *you* could be on it!
> Don't mess it up for everyone!

That last one didn't get me, by the way, as Reality TV doesn't appeal
to me.  But it did get a few of my friends -- they were clamouring
over themselves to help out who appeared to be in power.  *OMG I'LL BE
FAMOUZ.* **This one is powerful -- *and dirty*, in my opinion.** It's
one thing to prepare for something you're trying to bring about.  It's
another to manipulate with false hope.

### Why I would prefer not to publish this

Many people just won't understand.  To these people, I'll probably
just seem paranoid and negative.  Those people probably haven't lived
a very exciting life.  At least I can say I've lived for things worth
fighting for.

Oh -- did I mention that I'm looking for a job?  It's not smart to
talk about former employers.  But, one thing that pisses me off is
being bent over a barrel and being unable to tell anyone about it!
People can get away with a lot of shit when they think you're not
going to say anything about it.

Con artists use this trick by the way: dupe someone with a particular
trick they'll feel utterly embarrassed to tell someone about.  The
principle is the same: some people expect that you'll never talk about
what happened anyways, **so they think they have leeway to do what
they *wilt* ** ... I cannot stand this!  **If it burns me, so be it.**
But I'm not going to let someone get away with something because I'm
paralyzed with fear.

### Why am I so well acquainted with this?

That's a really, really good question.  I don't know the answer, but
it honestly makes me feel like shit.

It seems like most of my friends my age can't relate to what I'm
saying.  At least a few years ago, most hadn't had enough experience
with office politics -- or they're in a field that attracts different
personality types.

It seems like everything goes perfectly for them.  Maybe they're not
in as competitive situations.  Or maybe I just don't see their
problems, or maybe they don't show them.  That's one thing about this
world that I can't stand.  Everyone has problems, but it's like you're
not allowed to talk about them!  Of course, everyone says you should.
But really, you're at an incredible disadvantage if you do.  It's
bullshit.  And jeez -- better not post it to social media.  Keep that
to yourself, keep yourself isolated.

Also, it seems that most people have better social models than I do.
While I seem to be able to predict behavior fairly well, they are more
able to react to it.  Since I have Aspergers, it seems I am not as
great with relationships.  I'm more reserved, it can be harder for me
to establish relationships, which leads to less experience with
people.

Oh, and then I constantly have to move back home out of depression.
So, there's that.  Goodbye, relationships I've been cultivating.
Probably not going to see you again, for years at least.

### Basically, it seems that i'm at a disadvantage in life ...

#### ... Or maybe I just have a narcissistic persecution complex, like Stephen Colbert.

## That's it for Part One.

I'm totally rambling ... and psychoanalyzing myself.  Not really a
good combination.  I'm going to pick this back up with Part Two, where
I'll describe what I've experienced, generally and specifically.  I'll
also provide some tools to help these prevent these situations from
arising.

## Part Two: [General Strategies](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html)

For now, my friends... Watch that clip ... It's hilarious. ^^^
