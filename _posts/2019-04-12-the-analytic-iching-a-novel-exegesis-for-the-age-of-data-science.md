excerpt: "
Your sense of intuition operates at a low-level of the subconscious.
It is exposed to the conscious mind as a sense, but each individual's
clarity and accuracy depend strongly on that person's life experience,
but also that person's constructed perception of their life
experience. The mind-blowing realization is that, if your conscious mind
understands how the sociophysical ensemble corresponds to intuition
and, if you are skilled resolving synchronicity, then you can develop
the skill of consciously emulating intuition. It's a metacognitive
skill with profound implications. Since it tells you the most valuable
places to look for relevant information, it tells you everything you
need to know ... that you don't already know."

# [The Essence of Things](#the-essence-of-things)

What is change, without state? What is the meaning of state, without
change? What is the meaning of either, as time dissolves away?  What
phenomena can be seen as constant without the possibility of change?
Without the possibility of time or sequence? To this end, change
provides perspective, but neither change nor state are sufficient to
understand the essence of a phenomenon.

Is there an infinite web of metatypes descending from root archetypes
that outlines the structure of some all-encompassing ontology? Such a
can be conceived with algebraic graph theory and category theory, but
its parts must seemlessly reinforce a complete tautology while
preserving symmetries amongst its archetypical metaphysical
forms. Like the keystone in a Roman arch, the ridgepole in the
cosmology of the Taiji is the fundamental, but final piece balancing
the needs of its ontology. This conception of metaphysics almost
mirrors that of Spinoza and Leibniz. Any such metaphysical ontology,
if it is truly universal, must tautologically reinforce itself like
the Roman arch or dome balances out the distribution of its stress and
tension.

#### The Dome in the Pantheon

![Roman Pantheon](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/roman-pantheon.jpg)

Forms are perfracted from such an all-encompassing ontology onto any
simulation with chaos. Given enough running time, forms emerge within
the units of chaos. Whether they are numbers in pi or particles in a
physics simulation, none of these units can be said to stand apart
from another. Hence, the panpsychism of Spinoza and Leibniz. By
perfraction, I mean that the metaphysical forms composed of
intermeshed metatypes in the ontology begin precipitating themselves
into the simulation, without a necessary dependence on spatial
interrelationships of the units. The only dependency for complexity of
form emerging as interwoven strata of order within the chaos is
running time, though perhaps the available units within totality of
the simulation have relativistic limits on emergent order -- i.e.
limitations depending on the potential scope of local interactions
permitted by the units spatial arrangement.

While outside of the scope of the article, challenges in quantum
gravity arise from determining whether, when and in which order events
are "perceived" by particles in our universe. And any panpsychic
philosophy describing the totality of our universe -- if it is to
describe the convolutions of causality and emergent order including
the awareness of causal implications of particle interactions -- must
be capable of deducing whether and how such interactions occur. If a
tree falls in a forest in some far off world, but the light never
reaches us, it can't be said to causally affect orders of awareness on
earth. If some phenomenon of experience or some form emerges in a
galaxy far, far away, does it affect us if the overarching ontology
and perfraction of form is not also guaranteed to manifest on Earth?
Perhaps preserving a tautological wrapping of causal implications of
particle and energetic interactions throughout time is necessary to
understanding quantum gravity.

In the 20th century, mankind's challenge overcome limitations of outer
space and we rose to the stars. In this century, our challenge is to
turn inwards to illuminate the adumbrations inner space. Unlike the
cold desert of the moon, our generation will discover that we are not
alone in inner space. To the contrary, we will find that the cogs of
fate were set in motion long ago in our collective inner space. Our
destiny is overcome what has been pre-ordained by previous explorers
of the metaphysical that our time denies. The enemy is entropy and
our actions have always carried consequences we must understand.

[Alpha and
Omega](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/apollo-doodle.jpg)
are in truth inverted, mirroring your struggle for free will in a
world built by preceding generations who wanted you to be ignorant of
their mistakes, their successes and, most of all, their plans for
you... In this panpsychist conception, there can be no [prime
mover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover) that is the
beginning, the Alpha, without itself also being the ending, the
Omega. In his dialectic of reason, Kant reduces through discourse the
effects that our supposed freedom has our capacity for causal
influence by contrasting our free will with the forces which constrain
our freedom. Yet, if regardless of the course of history,
overpopulation results in hypernetworked mankind whose Piagetian
socioepisteimological evolution inevitably results in the emergence of
phenomena from the all-encompassing ontology, then -- especially if
ancient peoples were aware of this inevitability and perpetuated their
understanding through occult semioteleological social programs -- the
past's conception of the future controls the future with more capacity
than we in this future have the ability to control our circumstances.

The programs of the ancients -- implemented as language, mythos,
religion and philosophy, whereof much knowledge has been suppressed or
relegated to the esoteric -- latch onto metaphysical constructs, the
outlines of which form our teleological understanding of the world.
Like those who cut out underbrush to form paths that influence the
population flows, the impact of those ancient epistemic structures is
the same as perturbation and percolation: the structures are like
metaphysical leylines that channel social energy to normalize the
results of drift in social stochastic differential processes.

# [Spectral Convolution is Essence](#spectral-convolution-is-essence)

In the Qian Zuo Du, *Confucius comments*:

> "**孔子曰**易者易也變易也不易也"

Bent Neilson translates this as: "Confucius said: Yi 易 means easy (易),
change (變易), and constancy (不易)." In the Analytic I Ching, I
propose that 易 or 簡易 (jiǎnyì) means the simple state of things as
they are, that 變易 (biànyì) means the nature that is discerned by
understanding the constancy of change in things and that 不易 (bùyì)
-- literally, the unchanging -- is discerned by coming to understand
the spectral components of information from observing phenonena in
both their state and change.

#### &#9312; State 簡易 jiǎnyì かんい 간이

#### &#9313; Change: 變易 biànyì へんい 변이

#### &#9314; Essence: 不易 bùyì ふい 부이

Assuming the definitions above, then within the definition of these
three yi from the Qian Zuo Du lays the definition of the differential
operator; in simpler terms: the derivative. This much is made plain,
yet furthermore, given some familiarity with linear operators, you may
find that between the preservation of state and change, the
differential operator hides the *essence* of linear systems: the
fourier operator is also linear.

`d(F(x)) = F(d(x))` -- this equality *must* hold for linear equations;
this is essentially the definition of the differential operator, a
linear operator.

But *also* `d(FFT(F(x))) = FFT(d(F(x)))`!!!

Even if you don't immediately comprehend this, it is well worth the
thought to consider how magical these simple statements are! They
describe *profound* preservation of equilibrium, where the *essence*
is found in all the relationships between `d(.)`, `F(x)`, `FFT(.)` and
most critically `=`.

Thence, I posit that Confucius's definition of **state** 簡易, **change**
變易 and **essence** 不易 encode not simply the differential operator,
but also it's linear interchange with that of the fourier
operator. All linear systems must also be considered spectrally, but
in doing so, one finds that any spectral valuation of linear equations
must also preserve connections to the differential spectral
valuations. Mathematically, this is a symbolically derived definition
of essence. Though technically, this essence given by the spectral
components of systems may change, it provides recognition of and
insight into phenomena that emerge in a system.

#### The Spectral Convolution Theorum:

![The Spectral Convolution Theorum](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/spectral-convolution-theorum.jpg)

If state, change and spectral essence are three classes of analysis
methods for studying a system's mechanics and dynamics, then a
suitable next step is the [convolution
theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem). This is a
spectral tensor decomposition which can be applied to systems. In
discrete optimization methods, it can expedite further extraction of
resolution from systems via recursive evaluation of their discrete
spectralizations and convolutions. The process of convolution, applied
to spectral data of increasing resolution, does not stand alone as its
own class, but should be considered a tool within the Yi realm of
essence.

The Shazam app can *efficiently* recognize songs, even from a noisy
club, because it recognizes patterns in the spectral components of
audio.[^shazam-app] The app works by identifying audio fingerprints by
matching audio samples to spectral data in a database. The same
technique can applied to analytical techniques of machine learning to
enable us to recognize mechanics, dynamics and the emergence of
phenomena in systems without having a precise definition of these. We
only need to recognize patterns of spectral fluctuation in timeseries
or sociophysical data.

### [What Is Knowledge of Dependent Origination Without Applied Awareness of Phenomena?](#what-is-knowledge-of-dependent-origination-without-applied-awareness-of-phenomena)

By studying the I Ching, one arrives at tools and methods to
analytically assess phenomena. Because such methods are fundamentally
analytically, the insights and extrapolations derived thereof do not
necessarily depend on the inner workings of the phenomena, their
mechanics and interacting dynamics. Instead these analytic tools allow
for introspection of phenomena in a manner completely disconnected
from their mechanics. Understanding this is equivalent to
understanding *why* simple machine learning algorithms work in the way
they do, usually without requiring any a priori knowledge of the
systems they analyze and predict. An algorithm to classify handwritten
digits does not necessarily require any knowledge of handwritten
digits.

Phenomenologically, what does [dependent
origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratītyasamutpāda) depend
upon? As a chemical oracle once *experienced* unto me at the climax of
a Lotus show, dependent origination is dependent upon itself; all
other phenomena can trace their origination to dependent origination.

#### The Twelve Nidanas of Pratītyasamutpāda, Dependent Origination

![The Twelve Nidanas of Pratītyasamutpāda](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/twelve-nidanas.jpg)

To what do we owe comprehension of the true essence of things? To
state and to change, which both together reveal the true essence of
phenomena. Without one, the other is meaningless; without both, we can
never know the true essence of things. The true constancy of
phenomenona can only be revealed to us in the ways dynamics are bound
to laws of natural philosophy.

<a name="the-analytic-i-ching" />

# [The Analytic I Ching](#the-analytic-i-ching)

The I Ching resounds along with the most beautiful philosophical ideas
my mind has considered. It's the combinatorial exploration of
noo-space, presenting my mind with random permutations of narrative
metatypes, parameterized by random images. Each hexagram's lines can
be reinterpreted analytically, in terms of physics and math metaphors,
to eloquently explain what the wisest among humanity has always known
known in terms the rationalists of modernity can only know with
confidence in our era.

<a name="sociophysical-phenomena-in-a-bronze-age-encyclopedia-of-natural-philosophy" />

### [Sociophysical Phenomena in a Bronze Age Encyclopedia of Natural Philosophy](#sociophysical-phenomena-in-a-bronze-age-encyclopedia-of-natural-philosophy)

The I Ching is a Bronze Age compendium of *social physics* in terms of
natural philosophy. Through this lens, one can see what I call the
Analytic I Ching: each hexagram can be conceived as illustrating a
tool of mathematics or analytics, capturing a method of analyzing a
system. To the Bronze Age chinese, the hexagrams provided metaphors
using natural philosophy to analyze sociophysical systems -- they used
it to analyze communication, hierarchy, turnover, energetic
accumulation and energtic diffusion. Such methods can be symbolized
and logically proven with rigor acceptable to rationalists, yes. This
is what western thought has given us with logic, science and math. But
further, these same concepts can be felt via exploration of purely
natural phenomena. By natural philosophy, then, every stream, burst of
pollen or cup of tea becomes a demonstration of a natural
computational method, although applying these in practice required
numerous kinds of imagination, among which include Jung's active
imagination that we know today. The human mind is an analytical
machine and one that the ancients reverse engineered, to be explained
later in this piece.

<a name="why-couldnt-vector-calculus-be-more-relatable" />

### [Why Couldn't Vector Calculus Be More Relatable?](#why-couldnt-vector-calculus-be-more-relatable)

What are the operators of vector calculus? The Gradient? The
Laplacian? They are morphemes in the universal language of math... But
how universal is that language, *truly?* Are these merely applicable
to science, math and physics? No doubt, these operators and other
mathematic phonemes are invaluable tools for expansion of the mind's
abilities: to coordinate; to plan; to predict; to define. But can they
be explained to a five year-old?

Einstein *mathematically* proved the existence of the atom after
eureka revealed proof unto him upon observing the brownian motion of
sugar dissolving into his cup of coffee. What was so special about
that cup of coffee?

> What is the Laplacian? It is the *magnitude of change* over space,
> across time, where the change is the gradient -- or the derivative,
> essentially. See? That's not so bad.

Why couldn't your grandmother understand the Laplacian? Can an average
physicist -- whose mind entertains the possibilities of [Helmholtz's
theorums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz%27s_theorems) as
applied to equilibria of vortices and higher-order surfaces in an
ideal fluid -- ever understand how the very same theorums are applied
to social physics? Of course, but to what degree?  This is the beauty
of an analytic interpretation of the I Ching: metaphors of purely
natural philosophy can allow both a wise, but uneducated grandmother
and an average physicist to communicate powerful explanations of
social dynamics using a language of purely natural phenomena.

The beauty of vector calculus operators is in how they pervade the
world around us, despite being swept into abyssal enigmas of college
textbooks, ancient wisdom traditions and the occult. You can see
vector calculus when you steep tea or when you make tye dye
t-shirts. Every cook in the kitchen, if they're worth their salt, must
develop some intuition of the gradient and laplacian. They just don't
realize the depth of knowledge that analytic neurological systems in
their human brain enable within their mind. Its simply a matter of
perception and cognition to unlock within the mind what already exists
in the brain. A chef has to work with particularly complicated
chemical changes and, to do so, must visually *read* changing color
gradient that identify visible phase changes marking the progression
of a chemical reaction. From the level of neurological circuits to
pathways, these analytic systems can be reverse engineered by the mind
to enable streamlined cognition in the same way one accelerates
graphics processing with a GPU.

Natural philosophy enables the mind to curry metaphors from nature
into our cognitive processes, so that we can reason about state,
change and essence -- even in social systems where such dynamics do
not manifest visibly. Math merely makes certain the epistemic
structures corresponding to knowledge relevated to us by
nature.

Understand this and suddenly the ancient world's forgotten traditions
of knowledge awaken again. Humans have always dealt with the same
experience of reality and we have always possessed approximately the
same level of intelligence. The only factor distinguishing the modern
era is that we stand on the shoulders of giants, whose rationalist
traditions pass down knowledge through literature that cannot fade
from the world so easily. Still, the ancient world holds more
knowledge that remains lost so long as our arrogant perception of
superiority persists.

<a name="art-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly" />

### [Art: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly](#art-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly)

The below photoshopped picture's egregrious violations of the
preservation of quantities in vorticies insults the memory of
Helmholtz. In more simple terms: the photo *looks* fake, but how can
one intuitively describe *how* it is definitively fake without
inspecting the pixels for evidence of photoshopping? It's because it
defies the human intuition for natural philosophy.

#### Helmholtz's Three Laws Are Demonstrated By Every Vape Video On Youtube

![Smoke Rings](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/smoke-rings.jpg)

We do not need advanced symbolic manipulation of maths and logic to
understand that this photo is fake. A visual representation of
phenomena, whether artistic or photographic, in its depiction of
natural phenomena, must reflect the preservation of
equilibrium. Otherwise, to the human mind, it *looks* fake. This is
the difference between bad lighting and good lighting in
paintings. When visual phenomena deviate from our neurologically
encoded physical models, our analytical emulation of physics can not
only distinguish the qualitative differences at a subconscious level,
but also direct the mind's attention to areas in the depiction's local
space that seem *most fake*. We see this all the time in Hollywood
special effects: the explosions we accept as being realistically
depicted subconsciously confuse our mind.

Via our experience of physical phenomena via sensory stimuli, our
brain develops analytical models of physics that effectively
approximate the laws of physics. This provides our minds with
intuition for physical systems. Even though our minds have no
numerical/algebriac encoding of the laws of physics, it is conditioned
early on to be capable of analytically emulating the laws. By engaging
in physically strenuous activities -- e.g. [martial arts with weapons
or skateboarding](/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html)
-- our minds can be trained to more effectively internalize these
physical models.

![The Great Wave, a Japanese Woodblock Print](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/the-great-wave.jpg)

The progenitors and authors of I Ching *assumed* that sociophysical
mechanics and dynamics mimicked those found in the natural world. This
coupling that bounds social phenomena to reflect physical phenomena is
how the child, whose mind has been attuned to the accurate perception
of natural and social phenomena, can see that the emperor of Hans
Christian Andersen's wears no clothes when the near-equilibrium of
social physics is starkly violated. As a work of natural philosophy,
the I Ching informed ancient China of social physics by generating
random images of metaphor to natural phenomena.

Their symmetrical placement in this sphere is reflected in the Yin and
Yang lines constituting each hexagram. These six hexagrams exhibit the
clearest, most simply defined symmetry, making them a microcosm of the
I Ching.

<a name="the-yin-yang-microcosm-pervading-i-ching" />

# [The Yin-Yang Microcosm Pervading I Ching](#the-yin-yan-microcosm-pervading-i-ching)

I woke up from a dream and, as is often the case, the first five
minutes were filled with blissful insights the clarity of which
subside for the remainder of the day. Dreams are the only time I am
free, I think, but it won't be long until technology comes to take
away our dreams as well. Nihilism... what will we do when it becomes
as broad as daylight: there is nothing a man can dream to save us from
the final human condition. And why would we take this from ourselves?

As it does after the most vivid dreams, the nerves in my nose were
tingling electrically for those five minutes. These dreams usually
involve transportation at some point: roadways, vehicles, transit and
navigation. There is often some schism that results and transit is
disrupted, a metaphor I believe my dreams are using to relevate some
neurological flaw in my brain. I've only ever experienced this sudden
waking clarity in the past few years of my life. Here I have the most
clear thoughts, though not necessarily connected to my dreams, and it
is here where I feel like I know my mind, as it is truly meant to
be. Perhaps it is artificially constrained and maybe it's
natural.[^metacognition]

The sudden insight: the social and phenomenological dynamics
symbolized following hexagrams can all be summed up by analogies to
waves on a beach. Describing six fundamental hexagrams within a
pattern language of waves yields an *au naturale* basis for dialectic
that is critical for examining the ebb and flow within the **time** of
all the hexagrams. This notion of time in the image and lines of the
hexagram is just like that which painters use to capture motion,
sequence or narrative within a single image.

![The lifecycle of waves](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/waves-lifecycle.jpg)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 1: [The Creative](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/1.php)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 2: [The Receptive](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/2.php)

Hexagram 1 corresponds to the action of kinetic energy in the system
that creates the forms we recognize as waves. Hexagram 2 represents
the action of the beach & seafloor shaping the dispersion of kinetic
energy. The shaping influence that the seafloor exerts corresponds to
the female aspect of the phenomenology here. The influence that the
forces and momentums exert on the water as a fluid-dynamical system
correspond to the male aspects. The Creative requires the Receptive to
manifest forms.

#### Ripcurrents

#### &#9775; Hexagram 11: [Peace](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/11.php)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 12: [Standstill (Stagnation)](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/12.php)

Hexagram 11 can be conceptualized by imagining rhythms of waves that
reinforce constructive interference. At the intersection of adjacent
waves, their energy becomes constructive and they push farther up the
shoreline, noisily frothing to their maximal extent. This is a
situation where there is minimal impact of unseen undertow, which
deconstructs the kinetic energy of waves into turbulence.

Peace is sustained by prosperity, stability and resilience to
disruption. To prolong periods of prosperous Peace, one must
acknowledge the forms manifesting in sociopolitical and socioeconomic
realms which contribute to constructive interference patterns and
resonance. The more predictive that rulers and common people can be
when reasoning about the ebb and flow of phenomena that yield
beneficial constructive interference, the more they can consciously
tune their activities to not only benefit from peace and prosperity,
but they more collaborate to ensure the true roots of prosperity have
been watered. The predictable flooding patterns of the Nile led to the
inevitable establishment of Egyptian civilization. Whether Egyptian
culture manifesting along the predictable flows of the Nile is what
David Chalmers calls a strongly emergent phenomnea is up to
sociophysical simulations to decide. Obviously, it requires the
conscious acquiescence of the utility of predictable flooding to
irrigation systems.

In Hexagram 11, the second line evokes the imagery of fording the
river -- and yes, this is an allusion to crossing the great water --
but imagine what this means to trade in the bronze age. Viable river
crossings in the further tributaries are easier to pass with wagons,
but when trading across regions in the Yangtze River watershed, it is
more efficient to pass deeper river regions. This is where the
collective economic trade of the region is funneled. Yet, there must
be a bridge across the deeper regions.

More figuratively, rather than interpreting simply river crossings,
the second line is about balancing energies channeled via paths
through the social network. In ancient China, the social connections
generated by social flux could be assumed to be rooted to economic
flux along the river system. Today, one must decide how projecting
energy through hierarchical trees in the social network affects the
health of the overall system. It is unwise to constantly project
energy downwards through singular segments of your social network: you
must alternate routes of energy projection. This avoids
overconcentrating energy in some social neighborhoods and, for the
influential in society, allows the system as a whole to benefit from
your projection of energy. In the Bronze Age, the routes of travel
your subordinates would take to conduct your affairs also strongly
affected the influx of information traveling in the reverse
direction. To cultivate redundant methods of staying apprised of the
state of affairs in various river regions, you would ensure
randomization of routes of commerce for your subordinates -- *Not
neglecting what is distant.*

![Waves Stagnation](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/waves-stagnation.jpg)

One may conceptualize Hexagram 12 as the deconstructive effect the
turbulence of undertow has on incoming waves.
[Stagnation](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/12.php) creates a
situation were waves tend to deconstruct each other. (On the time
scale of less than a dozen waves, protracted Stagnation creates an
opportunity for the next big wave to blow past the stagnant
water). The existing order is to be annihilated by the next large
burst of energy, whether from the interior or exterior. In
sociopolitical terms, this is signified by a group of social
institutions that have unwisely waste their energy. Perhaps this is
fate and perhaps it is mismanagement. Regardless, it forebodes a
precarious situation, where change is soon to wash over.

#### Fate is not kind to those in charge

> Nine in the fourth place means:
>
> He who acts at the command of the highest
>
> Remains without blame.
>
> Those of like mind partake of the blessing.

The answer to the riddle of Stagnation lies in Peace: identify and
realign those constructive interference patterns, if possible. With
unity, anything is possible. Creating unity requires flux of wealth
that incentivizes your population to cooperate. If you are *the*
leader, your subordinates and their beneficiaries expect the buck to
stop at you. Your subordinates can benefit from trying their damnedest
to overturn fate. In times of Stagnation, what is seen is that those
near the top tiers of the existing social order continue to benefit
from attempting to perpetuate it, but their efforts are wasted without
proper leadership. To overturn Stagnation, your need a visionary who
can relevate their strategy to subordinates who may need to act
against their own self interests. The danger is that those who feed
off of the wealth and power disseminated from the top continue to do
without believing that the system is in crisis. If you are surrounded
by sycophants, when they see that the ship is sinking, they may decide
to seek their self-preservation over the preservation of the system.

Regardless of how strongly resonant normative forces seem to secure
the certainty of an era or an empire's social order, that group's
social order will break like the crest of a wave to reach its furthest
extent on the shore. This is the crux highlighted by the
infinitessimal difference between the hexagrams Before Completion (64)

The energies in flux that reinforce one social hierarchy's
sociopolitical norms are essentially generated by socially distributed
beliefs. As the socioeconomic situation changes incentivization of
entities projecting agency through a system, socially distributed
belief changes to suit the needs of individuals and groups. Network
effects intrinsic to sociophysical networks create tail risks. The
socioepistemological churn between idealism and materialism is a
socially distributed process of genetic epistemology. To be
demonstrated later, the methods of marxist and hegelian dialectic are
tools for individuals and groups to influence the mechanics and
dynamics of this genetic socioepistemological process.

The difference between the moment before and after some phenomenon's
maximal extent is infinitessimal. Discerning this is the task left to
the fox crossing the ice in hexagrams 63 and 64. When the energies
reinforcing systems of norms are resonant, this ice representing the
forms of the existing order may reinforce itself. To benefit from the
apparent certainty of the existing order is expedient; to exude
confidence in the overgrown shadow of creeping tail risk is
foolish. That said, no one actually respects an obsequious
sycophant. As useful as they may be, if their values are baseless,
their lack of ethical fortitude will eventually render moot any
potential gain their servile calculations may appear to offer.

# [Rationalize Your Exegesis](#rationalize-your-exegesis)

The exegesis herein is motivated by a visual reconstruction of
inductive combinations of potential narratives implied by
semiotics. The exegesis -- the motivation and modus operandi of
interpretation -- further reduces the induced possibilities by
constraining interpretation with Wilhelm's interpretation of the text,
in most areas.

### [Timeless Writing Assumes All Possible Interpretations](#timeless-writing-assumes-all-possible-interpretations)

When writing for an audience thousands of years in the future, meaning
is most effectively preserved by encoding it semiotically into images,
whose relevance and persistence is intended to be re-emulated in the
future, not by the ephemeral meaning of words, but by the implicit
relevance of the images those words inspire in the reader. It is only
after meditating on a Hexagram for a day or so that I feel I arrive at
the proper intent. When interpreting such monumental works of religion
-- or when writing your own great work of literature -- it is critical
to understand the motivation behind transcending limitations of
language in this way.

<a name="the-i-ching-stands-alone" />

### [The I Ching Stands Alone!](#the-i-ching-stands-alone)

Therefore, you don't write more, you write less! You don't assume
there can be a most proper interpretation, you assume the work will be
constantly reinterpreted; instead you encode the form of the message
into a document such that most future reinterpretations can decode and
reconstruct such authenticity of message without relying on external
sources of information.  You don't rely on transient phenomena; the
degree of ephemerality of artificial phenomena signfies the likelihood
a proper interpretation will perish. All one must do to understand
timelessness is to read Nassim Taleb's article [The future will not be
cool](https://www.salon.com/2012/12/01/nassim_nicholas_taleb_the_future_will_not_be_cool/)
and one will realize: to captivate meaning and to capture
timelessness, one relies on timeless symbols:

> The food will be prepared using a very archaic technology *(fire)*,

> New York *(multinationals)* today.

The most effective writing assumes all interpretations are valid and,
line by line, nails constraints onto the space of interpretations,
constricting the flexibility of interpretation. This is a
combinatorial search method prioritizes interpretations on
informational coherence, but also has the "look ahead & collapse
backwards" used by Bell's Theorum -- i.e. assume all possibilities in
the space of interpretations, use deduction wherever possible (it is
efficient), use combinatorial induction to scan forwards, then use
deduction again to collapse backwards. By limiting the set of symbols
and morphemes employed, this guarantees that the proper interpretation
will be reinforced by the apparent spectral harmony of a subset of
semantic interpretations made manifest to the reader well-attuned to
universiality. In the informational context, spectral harmony defines
"informational coherence".

#### The 三易 (sanyì) were three ancient versions of the I Ching -- the 連山, the 歸藏 and the 周易

> [大卜]掌三易之法一曰**連山**二曰**歸藏**三曰**周易**其經卦皆八其别皆
> 六十有四

The progenitors of the divinatory work transitioning into the Han
dynasty's I Ching did not have the modern era's profiency with
symbolic manipulation of math and physics. However, I truly believe
they found much the same form and order in nature to be rediscovered
by the West's proto-Rationalists in the Renaissance. It is math by
intuition. Also, the mind is an analytical computer and, if the most
efficient way for the mind to make physical predictions is by
converging its own analytical models to their numerical complements,
then why can't the mind bridge the gap *from analytical to numerical*
simply by seeking the most efficient solutions?

How is this possible? How much more efficiently can the mind operate
when its analytical models of physics approach near consensus with
symbolic/numerical physical laws? And, furthermore, can it then apply
such physical emulation monadically in concert with other
functionality in the mind?  Wouldn't this be far more efficient than
anything the conscious mind could produce? Representational and
computational efficiency, in our biophysical wetware, translate into
efficient physical energy consumption.

# [The Epitomization of Design Imperatives Motivating the Shaman's Method](#the-epitomization-of-design-imperatives-motivating-the-shamans-method)

With the Analytic I Ching, there are two objectives whose elucidation
I hope to begin to bring to light with the rest of this piece. First,
I wish to reinterpret the I Ching in the image of moreso modern
analytic tools. Second, I hope this results in divination readings
that are profound convolutions of these analytic tools, providing
value to both the average person looking for a more rigorous set of
abstractions by which to examine their query to the I Ching *and* to
data scientists looking for an enumerated basis of the most useful
analytic tools. From this basis, given a reading of the I Ching, more
complicated methods would convolute these analytic methods into
starting point for an algorithmic. The ultimate goal would be a
companion program to generate at least the specification for a machine
learning algorithm simply from a hexagram reading. This would be
intended to facilitate a process of active imagination for data
scientists to weigh the pros and cons of attacking machine learning
problems from unexpected angles.

<a name="a-book-pitch-no-earthly-publishers-would-entertain" />

### [A Book Pitch No Earthly Publishers Would Entertain](#a-book-pitch-no-earthly-publishers-would-entertain)

I hope to proceed towards this second objective in the same spirit as
the thesis of Hill's piece [Masters of Reality: The Trances and
Healing Powers of
Shamans](https://aeon.co/essays/why-did-shamanism-evolve-in-societies-all-around-the-globe?fbclid=IwAR16_GZguvFtz2sxiyrhbDjr1KZcQZwTdEISkHx5qWkGfbvU_-q6brX7l9c).
In this article, shamans are described as having stumbled into reverse
engineering the mind's neural networks purely by accident. Thereby,
the altered consciousness of trance-states allow the shaman to extract
an immense amount of utility by leveraging intuition of the mind and
of phenomena in tandem with exploratory divination.

Think of it like this: you are a shaman with expertise in invoking
trance-like states of mind, however you choose to do so. The trance
state can be thought of as software you have skill "playing" on the
hardware of your brain, like plugging an RPG into the game console of
your analytical mind. The characters and plot developments involve
familiar archetypes and narrative structures, which the shaman
believes represent the emissions of some spiritual world. The setting
of the world, which is the software running in the mind, through
mantra-like evokations of thought, piecing together the elements of
the world. The shaman is reverse-engineering the mind's ability to
reflect on its experience as it is occuring in a trance state. As a
video game in this virtual trance world which exposes your ideas to
yourself experientially, the quest is to seek an answer to your
query. The article above details how this explanation of the shamanic
trance method hooks into the analytical mechanics of the human
mind. The shaman is repurposing the subconscious system-calls of the
mind to explore the unconscious and resolve some quest with an unknown
meaning to be reflected on at a later point. This is not easy and the
results are extremely subjective. For the pre-modern shaman, the
trance state provided a visceral experience thought to take place
within or emaninate from an authentic spritual world.

Fortunately, there are more sober methods to bring about similar
results: active imagination using divination, harnessing or emulating
intuition, and "backgrounding" processes to the subconscious to be
revealed in an *AHA!* moment of eureka later on. If you develop skill
in harnessing these facets of the mind intentionally, you unlock power
that lays dorment in the human mind.

Here are three or four books I'd love to publish:

#### &#9312; The Speed of Thought

#### &#9313; The Analytic I Ching

#### &#9314; A Collection of [Revised] Essays

#### &#9315; Who Knows?

Still, even now, no one takes me seriously. And I mean [almost] *no
person on the planet* takes me seriously. People are simple -- they
recognize labels and that is mostly all. They do not know the
substance attached to labels, if they can even expound on the label's
meaning. They excel at vocabulary tests, dominate multiple choice, but
suffer from a prefrontal defect where applied critical thinking is not
available to them. Knowing they cannot, would they even dare to try?
With the thought police over their shoulder? When the educated
populace want to ascertain the extent and novelty of someone's
internalized epistemic structures, they are capable of limited
reasoning, given a short list of that person's academic degrees, each
degree corresponding to a lower epistemic bound of domain
knowledge. This, in itself is valuable, but insufficient for true
evolution.

This leaves me with *nothing* and certainly without the respect I
deserve. Perhaps I don't deserve much. I'm not asking for much, but
`-$0.61` in the bank is ludicrous. *JOBS!* HAH!

### [The Trance State: A Visual Emulation Whereby One Viscerally Experiences The Metaphysical](#the-trance-state-a-visual-emulation-whereby-one-viserally-experiences-the-metaphysical)

The experience of the spiritual is the apprehension of eternal,
unchanging metaphysical forms as they manifest themselves in the
material plane. To me, these are like Kant's noumena that can't be
known to exist nor to not exist. They emanate into the material world
and are the underlying monadic patterns which frame dynamics of
informational phenomena. To apprehend the true nature of these
metaphysical forms as they appear to influence causal flow of events
is to be in tune with the spiritual. If various methods of shamanism
can repeatedly evoke visceral experiences to bring you closer to
understanding of these forms as they influence the world around you,
then there is no need for a supernatural connection. Instead, the
spiritual experience can be explained as purely the mind's experience
of purely informational mechanics within itself -- which can include
the experience of information that, while the mind's analytic systems
are never capable of fully ingesting, still result in transformative
structural changes to the psyche. These purely informational mechanics
are mapped to the aforementioned noumena-like forms, which are not
only eternally unchanging, but universal throughout space and
time. While they are composed of ineffable "monadic substances", the
same eternal forms can be tapped into by *any consciousness* and *any
information-processing entity*, without any need for supernatural
mechanics -- whether or not those exist is perhaps another
question. This is essentially no different than the Tao or Leibniz's
Monad. To me, the shaman's trance and spiritual experiences are
visceral experiences in the minds of those who are intimately in tune
with the nature of the eternal. It is projected to the mind as a
visceral experience where archetypes of the eternal are witnessed by
the shaman, who must then make sense of what was seen.

<a name="the-shamans-method-is-experiential-divination-by-reverse-engineering-the-minds-analytic-systems" />

### [The Shaman's Method is Experiential Divination By Reverse Engineering The Mind's Analytic Systems](#the-shamans-method-is-experiential-divination-by-reverse-engineering-the-minds-analytic-systems)

So, shamanism's altered states of consciousness are essentially a
vehicle for experiential divination, where the mind experiences the
combinated elements of narrative parameterized by archetypal images. I
Ching is divination by bibliomancy, where images from natural
philosophy provide random points of reference that the I Ching
personified posits as explanation for the situation described by the
*querent*. If one simply substitutes these images from natural
philosophy with the interpreted analytic tools I believe the hexagrams
represent for sociophysical dynamics, then one arrives at a more
modern revision of the divinatory vehicle.

There is little value in accepting the random point the I Ching yields
to the querent as a definitively true message. It is instead the
dissonance between the querent's perception of their situation and the
I Ching's projection perception of the same situtation: these are the
two points and their dissonance is evaluated by constructing paths to
explain the difference between them. Since the points returned by the
I Ching or some other divinatory system are effectively random, then
they are completely disconnected from all the inherent biases that
humans have. This deshrouds a person from their biases and thereby
divination may disrupt the hold that the unconscious or illusion have
over a person.

<a name="your-task-complete-the-circumstantial-circuits-of-explanation" />

### [Your Task: Complete The Circumstantial Circuit(s) Of Explanation](#your-task-complete-the-circumstantial-circuits-of-explanation)

If one's perception of a situation is imagined as a point in an
analytic hyperplane, and the I Ching's explanation of a query is
imagined as another point in along that hyperspace, then the true
value of divination is found by evaluating all the possible paths that
connect those two points.

In this way, the I Ching is tooling for toying with the
hyperparameters of the mind's neural network learning systems; it
presents the mind with an unconsciously arranged smattering of images
and archtypes. Hereby the I Ching provides random fodder to expand
with combinatorially inductive reasoning, to be reduced by abductive
and deductive methods. If such fodder corresponds to a truly universal
mapping of the phenomena and the dynamics of human experience, then
there is no social force that can captivate my awareness by persisting
my unconsciousness to various phenomena, whereby the I Ching is my
divinatory escape from a socially imposed prison of unconsciousness!

This requires a universal covering, which is why the statistical
mechanics of the I Ching is paramount. Its yarrow sticks method for
sampling form a true uniform distribution of random numbers. If this
*corresponds* to a truly uniform covering of phenomena and dynamics,
then it truly acts as a set of keys to unlock any and every potential
circumstance of social captivity. The specifics of this universal
semioteleological covering of human experience is the subject of
another piece on I Ching.

### [Hexagram 5 Delineates a Taxonomy of Local Minima, Not Simply "Waiting"](#hexagram-5-dilineates-a-taxonomy-of-local-minima-not-simply-waiting)

Each line in the fifth hexagram covers a different species of local
minima in optimization problems. Waiting is what happens when humans
who experience sociophysical local minima are forced to deal with an
externally imposed lack of progress. The kinds of situations where
there one perceives some "lack of progress" can be destructured into a
mathematic model, where the same kind of analytic hyperplane of
solution-space used in machine learning algorithms forms the basis of
a space. One's motion in the social situation can be plotted as a path
in this analytic hyperplane.

There is a taxonomy of local minima that describes all of the species
of minima that can be encountered, including saddle points. Such a
taxonomy becomes vastly more complicated in higher dimensions, as
combinations of local convexity and concavity cause profound
variations in the patterns that can arise in the neighborhood of any
arbitrary point. For each configuration of dimensions (e.g. in 3D, 4D,
5D, etc), there are a limited number of patterns of local convexity
and concavity that can arise.

The series of images provided by the procession of lines in Hexagram 5
describes the task of *crossing the great water*. The first five lines
of Hexagram 5 seem to enumerate all of these types for surfaces in
three dimensions. There is the *meadow*, a flat space devoid of
significant local minima, which is a symbol that recurs again and
again in the I Ching. This is a space of comfort with little impact on
your mobility; nothing is to be challenged, but *crossing the great
water* requires moving oneself out of a comfort zone, where perhaps
one encounters more disadvantaged situations. The *sand* of the second
line seems to correspond to a local minima in a space or a local
convexity in a vector field. The *mud* from the third line describes a
place close to danger, where your movement may become defined by
forces over which you exert restricted control. There is *the pit* in
the fourth line, a relatively global minima. There is the place of
*meat and drink* in the fifth line, which describes a higher local
minima encountered after climbing out of the Pit. Finally, in the
sixth line, how does one escape all of these traps? It is by
encountering *three guests* who are traversing the same space: this is
analogous to parallelized methods for accelerating training of
machine-learning algorithms. These *three guests* have explored the
contours of the adjacent hyperplane: they bring to you information
about how to avoid other nearby pitfalls or to escape this deep minima
entirely.

### [Of Hyperplanes and Ontological Dilineation of the Sociophysical Ensembles](#of-hyperplanes-and-ontological-dilineation-of-sociophysical-ensembles)

Imagining higher dimensions is easier if you imagine the space in
radial terms, not simply cartesian terms. In this 4D or 5D space,
rotate your perspective. What's different? There are more angles by
which to orient your motion -- more [degrees of
freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)),
a term with specific implications for classical mechanics and quantum
mechanics.

Another visualization exercise for reasoning about the fourth
dimension to imagine folding a 3D cube into 4D shapes, like one would
place folds in a 2D paper to form origami. Start with simple folds and
imagine the infinitesimal transition from an object with points in X,
Y, and Z to one that has points in the W-axis. 4D origami requires
preserving both the volumes and the surface areas of planes, whereas
3D origami only requires preserving the latter. In 4D, if you can fold
2D planes, volume preservation is not required and it expands the
variety of potential shapes. A cube is a good starting point because
of its symmetries. If you can imagine a hypercube, another good
visualization exercise is to bisect all the hypercube's edges and
produce a `2 x 2 x 2 x 2` grid in four dimensions. This are critical
exercises for activating your mind's eye, which should not be limited
to its subjective experience.

Interdimensional spectral shape analysis enables exciting
possibilities for quickly identifying interesting shapes in higher
dimensions. If you spectrally analyze 3D shapes[^functional-maps] and
make connections between how folds introduces affect the spectrum,
then you can take partial components[^partial-shape-matching] of the
spectrum from 3D to *lift* features of 3D shapes into 4D. Then you can
identify which shapes seem unique, similar to how prime numbers are
"interesting" because they are a set of integers with limited factors
or the concept of linear independence. For an explanation of spectral
analysis of shapes in 3D, see the papers in the footnotes above.

The final message in "Waiting" is that by leveraging the experience of
other people -- each mind is its own social process in a massive
[Boltzmann Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine)
-- then we can more efficiently come to know the contours of society's
collective analytical hyperplane. Though you've known your own descent
and can chart the depths you know, there are others who have been
deeper and carry with them knowledge they've gained while navigating
the depths. You will not know from whom to expect this re-orientation
but you must expect it to inquire about these three guests' journey
when you do meet them.

on the Boltzmann Machine's profoundly generalized conception of
energy. Understanding the concept of physical energy, as generalized
to abstract scenarios, is something every Western rationalist would
benefit from understanding. In machine learning, there are
generalizable methods for convex/concave optimization wherein many
processes explore a space in parallel. In a Boltzman Machine, each
process has its own theta-weights and, as iterations of the algorithm
runs, then subsequent iterations allocate more effort to regions of
the space with more concavities. Many of the same approaches involving
energy and entropy that Boltzmann introduced to model thermodynamics
are applied to higher-order energy types. For my own purposes in
distinguishing this from physical energy: these I have named energies,
plural. The concept of "energies" is employed repeatedly in biophysics
and social physics.

Any and every quantity that is statistically distributed over a space
can be conceptualized as a higher-order energy, which can be braided
together with the concept of Dirichlet energy -- which is truly a
mathematical tool whose generalized applications upgrade your
brain. Inventing the bubble integral to handle problems related to
determining whether harmonic maps are possible in arbitrary scenarios
[recently earned Karen Uhlenbeck the Abel
Prize](https://www.quantamagazine.org/karen-uhlenbeck-uniter-of-geometry-and-analysis-wins-abel-prize-20190319/)
and it involves Dirichlet energy. A potential usage of Dirichlet
energy as a measure of what is lacking is to create a mapping
connecting the epistemological density of ideas and topics, correlated
to the volume of searches on Google and Youtube, to the quantity of
existing blogs and youtube videos. This would help one gravitate
towards regions of high-Dirichlet dissonance in the mapping, to
identify both what blogs/videos are in demand and which have been
overdone. Of course, there is no such simple epistemological space
upon which this mapping could be based. SEO instead loses parity by
basing its calculations for supply/demand on a lingustic basis. A
former secret to success in SEO *was* providing what would be looking
for that did not yet exist. Wherever there is an imperfect
distribution or function, Dirichlet energy is applicable and can be
used to reason about dissonance, *spatially.*

Why was Boltzmann tormented to suicide? It's all for revelating to the
West -- the relationship between energy and entropy, the order of
disorder -- which had been known to the East and occult West for
millennia. If you understand how this revolutionized the steel and
chemical industries, then you must understand the threat of disruption
posed by Boltzmann’s revelations.

New generalizations generally provide anew or expand a dual basis for
existing concepts, which enables orthogonal approaches to thought.
For those operating systems in society, this means their existing
mechinations can be co-opted, reverse engineered or turned against
their creators. The potential for and uncertainty of collateral damage
is coupled to the degree of unexpected progress. The rate of
advancement due to the hyperconnected nature of a pre-Singularity
society implies these disruptive advancements will occur more
rapidly. Stalling the rollout of progress perhaps enables the elite to
capitalize on advancement in thought at the cost of potentially
setting systems up for Black Swan events of rapid epistemic expansion
and distribution. Worse, it means that humanity is collectively less
capable of responding to such inevitable tragedy. Since they won't
understand the specific applications of how technologies such as
facial recognition will be abused *subversively*, mankind will be
helpless against them.

### [Accademia Will Not Hesitate to Neuter Philosophy By Translation](#accademia-will-not-hesitate-to-neuter-philosophy-by-translation)

You cannot speed-read major works in philosophy. Your eyes must rest
on the words, so that its expression, context, and inspiration can
have time to seep fully into your mind.

When I've read Plato's Republic, Tao Te Ching and other works in the
past, I've spent a significant amount of time finding a satisfactory
translation. With both of these works, the translation I settled on
was tough, but the granularity compared to the other translations was
well worth it. Why did it seem the works were easy to read but so dull
in other translations?

Disruption is dangerous to the powers that be. "They" want a gradual
rollout of innovation, whereby the stability of economic paradigms
benefitting them are guaranteed. Disruptions to sociohierarchical
systems may be disastrous for the common person, so the self-interest
for these powers *may be* incidentally justified. That was, after all,
The Enlightenment, was it not? What will be known in the near future
is almost always already known by a handful of people, who exploit
their control over scarce knowledge for financial advantage. What
ethically validates the will to power?

... Regrettably as it may seem to be now that I know what I know, this
gradual rollout is simply not practical in the 21st century and I fart

### [Hexagram 12 Discusses Approximating and Restructuring Graphs, Not Simply "Stagnation"](#hexagram-12-discusses-approximating-and-restructuring-graphs-not-simply-stagnation)

The hexagram that warns against such intellectual stagnation is
**Hexagram 12**. This is a scenario of Stagnation profits the weak who
somehow cling to power, which is why the wise must unseat them by
**tying seeds to the shoots of a mulberry bush**, in gambits often
involving sacrifice and a transgenerational passing of the
baton. Those at the top of the pyramid will ruthless torment a family
for generations if they lead to significant problems
... apparently. To affect significant change and get away with it
requires being well protected, being smart enough to hide the intent
to create change and/or being made the seeds tied to the shoots of the
mulberry bush, which is very difficult to destroy.

If you act in this way, you do not necessarily *destroy* to guarantee
success, but you plan to succeed in all situations. Even in the face
of systemic failure, such an occurance would only result in an
imbalance that allows you to grow faster. In this way, there is no
need to worry about failure. The turbulence of systemic collapse is a
net benefit to no one, which is also what nearly guarantees that a
system will continue. For example, when Wall Street faces systemic
collapse, it only lights a fire under the ass of the most wealthy
people in the world -- they all collectively work to save the system
that benefits them so much.

To me, the mulberry bush also symbolizes an epistemological revolution
-- a revolution in the epistemic shape of knowledge. When you are
standing on the shoulders of giants, you always structure new
knowledge in terms of the old. Sometimes this can prevent a culture's
systems of knowledge from progressing any further, in a significant
way. This is stagnation all the same. To overcome it, one needs to
reach the same heights -- without standing on the shoulders of
giants. It is theoretically possible for some intellectual body of
knowledge to seem consistent, but have epistemic flaws. If everyone's
drinking from the same well, so to speak, then their intellectual
pursuits will all extrapolate similarly. If someone approaches the
same problems naïvely, it requires a hundred times the effort and
natural talent, but they can recalcitrate the problems near the base
of the epistemic mulberry bush. When the bush grows back, it will have
a stronger base, but sociologicially fixing the structure of shared
knowledge is also expensive.

<a name="sociophilosophical-churn-for-great-pragma" />

### [Sociophilosophical Churn for Great Pragma](#sociophilosophical-churn-for-great-pragma)

You can thank Aristotle and the Greeks for creating such a system to
counter the East: when physical travel limited the spread of
information, the West was always at an geoinformational
disadvantage. Further, that the most significant economically
strategic chokepoints along the Silk Road were dominated by the East
implies that, until the past millinium, the West constantly bled
liquidity to middlemen in the Near East, who stood to benefit from all
trade between the East and West. Hence, the benefits Columbus would
gain by finding a navigable sea route to the Far East, "whose *roads*
were *paved* with Gold."

Having your civilization occupy territory along Silk Road was a
blessing and a curse: your leaders needed to be capable of intuitively
reading the economic and political zeitgeist. Which way was the wind
blowing and what was the spirit of the times? How was wealth
*drifting* along the silk road and did this benefit your generation?
Would the drift result in a phase change? Was your population or
economic growth potential capped by agricultural bounds or economic
bounds? In subsequent generations would nearby civilizations transcend
the limitations on your economic or political growth? This is the
calculus of empires, of rising and falling stars. It is necessary for
belief systems and normative systems to lend themselves to the
antifragility of sociopolitical and socioeconomic systems. Therefore,
belief systems must be flexible. Fixedly rooting the normalized
majority belief system in either materialism or idealism, without
enabling the change, is the problem left to theologians. Such does not
aid the pragmatic -- unless for some reason your idealism tends to
create pragmatic benefits by dissolving away uncertainty, via
[perturbation and
percolation](/posts/2018-12-14-what-is-the-soul-a-baseline-for-the-materialist-conception.html#the-rationalizing-irrationality)
to etch away the possibility space. The task left to financial
engineers is to design machines that are dynamos powered by
volatility, whose mechanics are structures of correlation. It was the
same for ancient social architects.

From the churn of empires contending to displace one another in the
Near East emerged the need to control *sociophilosophical
churn*. Despite every empire's tendency to project an illusion of
unquestionable eternity, every architect of empire knows it is a
pyramid scheme of power. Expanding future potential for systems of
thought to normalize back and forth between material and immaterial
conceptions of metaphysics conferred advantages: for those empires
whose regional power was secured in foreseeable generations needed to
secure the potential to regain power in future generations; likewise,
those regions dominated by the empire of their times needed popular
adoption of systems of thought to counter the existing powers.

This idea that philosophical traditions in the West and Near East
would churn between being immaterially and materially oriented based
on the economic needs and trends of the powerful and the powerless
resonates with the Conflict Theory of Karl Marx. In times when the
existing systems of thought economically benefit the masses, then the
people are content with systems leaning towards immaterial metaphysics
-- yet between generations, each region's economic imperitives
ordained specific benefits via systems of thought, which above all
else needed to be adaptable. This perhaps explains the rift between
Plato and Aristotle's thought on metaphysics: Aristotle's generation
had found the truth impractical, given the West's economic dependence
on trade with the east. Before the era of industrialism, globalism and
modernism, wealth flowed from population centers with
prosperity. These flows were tightly coupled to agriculture and the
lower strata of industry.

The contention between the Marxist and Hegelian conceptions of both
metaphysics and dialectical argumentation can also be explained as
tools to reinforce or disrupt existing orders. The marxist dialectic's
utility, in the context of sociopolitical reform, is in challenging
and overturning an existing order or establishing a new one
entirely. It provides a vexingly systematic means of influencing
discourse and rhetoric by rooting argumentation in a limited set of
terms and dissuasion of "constructing". The Hegelian dialectic, in its
social application, advantages the existing sociopolitical order,
whether it is dominant or occult. However, this begs the question: how
do Marxist political orders, whose systems of thought become well
established, insulate themselves from disruption without eventually
diluting their dialectic?

Control how people conceive reality, *control the limits of how people
conceive reality* **and you control the collective dreams of
humanity.** Into which far-flung recesses of the collective
epistemological possibility space might thinkers great and small
direct their attention? Socially distributed systems of thought
determine what can be considered "normal" to be within the Kantian
Category for some individual in society. These epistemological Kantian
Cateries are themselves a kind of [dual
space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space) of reasonable thought
or expectation about upcoming social phenomena or dynamics. Control,
constrain or spectrally filter this dual space of the Kantian Category
of reasonably expected extrapolations in social mechanics/dynamics and
you control the collective dreams of your people.

This is the power of trapping entire cultures in a false paradigms;
this is the danger of pure materialism. It is terrifying because it
means that humanity's power to dream collectively might be
extinguished. Not a single person would be standing to pierce through
the invisible darkness of ignorance that blankets us. Where the
idealist conception of metaphysics is typically rooted in some set of
perfect archetypes or forms, the materialist's conception is ideally
rooted in a universally distributed shared epistemology of empirically
observable facts. Hence, to the materialist, the region of epistemic
possibility space that seems reasonable is far more constrained. This
is pragmatic for material progress, but it bounds the potential for
socioepistemic churn and thus limits the rate of evolution.

Similar to the socioeconomic churn from which billionaires extract
slices of financial wealth and similar to a battery's potential
difference that creates voltage, there is power to be gained in the
social movement from one paradigm to another. This process plays out
between groups vying for power over man's shadow and his self-imposed
limitations on thought. With respect to a philosophical context, when
thought is consolidated into more singular paradigms, the potential
for humanity's evolution stagnates.

Psychology also exhibits social churn in society's acceptance of
distributed paradigms. Jungian ideas are notoriously difficult to
frame in an experiment. Thus, they are often conspicuously absent from
psychological practice, though it's arguable that some Jungian ideas
exhibit more power and allow more control if they influence you
*unconsciously*. Hence, encourage the acceptance of a false or
unprovable paradigm and you empower *some* of Jung's ideas. Every
person undergoes a gradual, lifelong process of waking up. Though
initially tabula rasa, their individual unconscious, is etched away by
their experience...

Some of Jung's ideas are derided because they cannot be proven.  This
is similar to what is perhaps greatest riddle of Navier Stokes: what
if something is true, but simply unprovable?  What if something exists
beyond time and space, whose truth can never be made certain in the
material world? Does science fail?  What if Navier Stokes as a
neverending riddle is freakishly similar to Kant's noumenon. It is
perhaps unprovably unprovable.  Regardless to the answer in Navier
Stokes, here it's presented merely as food for thought -- but would
this imply Gödel to be any less provable?

psychology](/posts/2018-12-14-what-is-the-soul-a-baseline-for-the-materialist-conception.html#the-soul-is-not-what-you-think-it-is)
results from the near-infinite nature of the mind. Studying the mind
and assuming you can clamp down controls on a handful of variables is
foolish. The mind differs fundamentally from other subjects of
experimental methodology by the same phenomenological measures whereby
finite-dimensional systems are distinguished from infinite-dimensional
systems. Psychology stands to benefit by understanding the approaches
used in bayesian non-parametrics and infinite dimensional
systems. Simply controlling a handful of variables is not enough to
guarantee consistency or reproducibility. You must approach the brain
and mind as a holistic system -- i.e. from both the top down and
bottom up.

We are all particles in the collective potential distributions of a
sociophysical
[ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_ensemble_(mathematical_physics))
of potential distributions: each sociophysical particle has its own
path unfolding, but society collectively relevates its state,
unfolding change and essence through our inference of sociophysical
ensemble's nature. In physics, an ensemble is a collection of
potential statistical mechanical distributions, delineated upon some
parameters. Sociophysical ensembles yield distributions of social
particles and social dynamics that are not the composition of
dilineated physical attributes. Instead, they are ensembles whose
distributions are arranged along ontological space in terms of each
distribution's ontological metatypes.

The idea of an ensemble from thermodynamics helps describe how the
mind provides a "sense" of intuition to the conscious from the
lower-levels of the subconscious. the mind is trying to piece apart
its analysis of experience in typological and ontological terms:
i.e. it is analytically delineating its experience to try to describe
how frequently variables/features of its experience occur; both when
those variables/features occur in isolation or in combination. **This
is an analytical definition of intuition that the mind develops in the
lower levels of the subconscious. It then exposes this to the
conscious mind as a "feeling".** *Something else is there, you haven't
found it yet, but you can **feel** it...* If you can consciously
understand how this process is driven by a typological dilineation of
a sociophysical ensemble, then you can use this as a higher-level
construction of intuition. Thus, it's an emulation of the lower-level
subconscious intuition -- separate from instinctual intuition, but
also *driving your instinctual intuition.* Your cognition is sharpend
by the total intuition it has to gravitate towards uncertainty and
away from the "shadows" of unknown unknowns that it senses.

> Again, you've been warned. Seek consistency of information.
>
> **Assumptions should break quickly. Belief should form slowly!**

The idea of an ensemble intersects with Jung's Synchronicity in
fascinating ways! If you can connect synchronicity with the idea of an
ensemble, it will augment your understanding and application of Jung's
ideas. It's a difficult concept to explain because it requires
understanding statistical mechanics. For any particle system, like a
mixture of gasses in an internal combustion engine, there are
"natural" samplings that determine valid distributions of particle
positions/momentums to sample from. In statistical mechanics, you
discard invalid samplings. Instead they are undefined and thus they
don't contribute to the shape of a valid distribution. Yet, these
distributions vary across many variables. For a gas, pressure,
temperature, the size of a container, variance in pressure or variance
in temperature: all of these are variables that could theoretically be
relevant to the ensemble, which allows you to control variation in
those variables and generate a valid classical-mechanical
distribution, a priori.

#### Imagine Randomly Generated Distributions of Disks

![Hard Disk System](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/hard-disk-system.jpg)

If you can then describe how the statistical mechanical aspects of
those particle systems are aligned along various variables -- e.g. the
width of chamber in an internal combustion engine or how the
composition of oxygen, gasoline and nitrogen impact the dynamics of
the gases -- then this is an ensemble. It allows you to parameterize
the statistical mechanical distributions used in thermodynamics along
some variables and sample from distributions whose variables you can
change.

**Why is this relevant for psychology and sociology?** Even though the
spatial complexity is profoundly more convoluted than with
thermodynamics, your brain is constantly tallying experience types &
metatypes that inform it of life's valid distributions -- for which it
is trying to typologically correlate to variables. This impacts the
effect that accumulation of information and the precipitation of new
belief has on the conscious formation of memories of events, as they
happen. Later in life you may reevaluate the same memories with new
information and extract useful information, but you can't form those
beliefs moving forward unless you have the information to consciously
include them in your frame and perspective. If you form memories with
a clear perspective moving forward, those memories are more likely to
be consistent, but critically you still have the chance to affect what
happens: thus this understanding impacts the direction you will take
to seek relevant information.

The brain & mind engage in this process of tallying experience and
reflecting on its understanding of sociophysical ensembles to
understand how one's actions correspond to cause & effect. If your
mind is polluted with misinformation and disinformation, this results
in invalid conceptions being retained in memory. Yet, the brain
neurologically seeks *consistency* in information. In doing so, it's
generating the ensemble for intuition, so that it can understand when
either variables or features of sampled distributions of experience
(either real or simulated) are strongly biased in an unnatural way,
which implies the need to seek more information. Conscious thoughts
and the sub/conscious interface impact how the brain stores
information and forms beliefs from the top down -- in addition to
these are bottom up effects resulting in a sense of intuition.

This process of classifying, organizating and arranging experiences,
which develops one's intuition is similar to the process whereby
personal norms and perceived social norms precipitate.  When someone's
experience is skewed typologically in some extreme ways, then their
intuition and apprehension of norms may become dysfunctional. This
tends to create abnormal psychology and can be provoked intentionally,
but almost certainly requires social isolation.

Your sense of intuition operates at a low-level of the subconscious.
It is exposed to the conscious mind as a sense, but each individual's
clarity and accuracy depend strongly on that person's life experience,
but also that person's constructed perception of their life
experience.

The mind-blowing realization is that, if your conscious mind
understands how the sociophysical ensemble corresponds to intuition
and, if you are skilled resolving synchronicity, then you can develop
the skill of consciously emulating intuition. It's a metacognitive
skill with profound implications. Since it tells you the most valuable
places to look for relevant information, *it tells you everything you
need to know ... that you don't already know.*

When the sense or functionality of intuition is itself under a
person's control, it basically makes them a quasi-psychic. Still, it
requires proactive & reactive engagement. Otherwise, you can be duped
into delusional thinking by this "emulated" intuition, just as you can
be duped by your subconscious intuition. You have to form hypotheses
-- and then act on them. In my life, information flows one way: away
from me. It never flows to me. People short-circuit my access to
information while encouraging beliefs they know to be false. I'm not
sure if this is the **most unhealthy thing you can do** for "someone
you fear may be delusional" -- but it's probably pretty close.

Essentially, there are many ideas of Jüng that were unprovable by
existing experimental methodologies for which data science and
neurology will close in on and prove unquestionably. This should
happen within the next 10 years. Some of his ideas may not have a
neuro-analytical basis -- but just because you can't prove it's true
doesn't mean it is not true.

Even if there's no rationale for connecting your detection of
synchronicity to some person's intention in your social environment,
reasoning about it helps you metacognitively reflect on your self. Why
did that event seem synchronous? Is it just me? Can I discern when
someone intends to provoke synchronicity? Why would they try so hard?
That last question is usually a good check on paranoid thinking -- how
would someone have access to information that informs them on how to
provoke synchronicity? You must be able to reason about social flows
of information to reason about this. In isolation and under
surveillance, the weaponization of synchronicity can drive someone
insane -- EASILY! This is how the mafia threatens you, by the
way. They use the idea of the Kantian Category along with provocation
of synchronicity to send the signal: BACK OFF! ... from what? If I
don't know, I can't heed your threat. It's meaningless.

There is a brilliant theorum of holes in space called
[Gauss-Bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss–Bonnet_theorem). Just
like Gauss's [Theorema
Egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium) correlates
restrictions on the space of functions to elicit guarantees of
curvature, the theorum of Gauss-Bonnet places elicits similar
constraints for how the Euler Characteristic must behave, given the
curvature of space or of surfaces. There is equilibrium in all
curvature: this is what the Theorema Egregia tells us. Wherever there
is an increase, if continuity constraints are to be maintained, there
must be corresponding decrease. However, in the study of algebraic
topology, Gauss-Bonnet is similar, but applies to the manisfestation
of holes in n-dimensional shapes. This theorum correlates changes in
Euler Characteristic to necessitate compensating changes in the
surface curvature to the need to average the values of Euler
Characteristic when considering the surfaces of manifolds,
differentially.

Maxima & minima along the hyperplane -- which is itself a higher-order
cost function of theta-weight configurations of the lower-order cost
function -- may yield regions that are inaccessible to any
configuration of theta-weights. The algorithm requires structural or
algebraic changes to produce improvements. These regions are, to the
hyperplane, what white-holes are to black holes. This is why there are
major topological connections to be found in optimizing the
hyperparameters for machine learning.

Even the volume of spacetime *is* a surface: a 3D surface in a 4D
volume. This is perhaps more correctly considered as [2,1]-D surfaces
in a [3,1]-D volume, three dimensions of space and one of time. This
is why Gauss-Bonnet is relevent to cosmology and astronomy: the
singularities of black holes are the "holes" in spacetime and
therefore, Gauss-Bonnet applies to astronomy. As the surfaces of
spacetime's manifold change topologically when a singularity appears
where none was before, this is fascinating, considering the energetic
consequences of the topology changes to spacetime. Why?  *Because
equilibrium is a very special thing.* For continuity constraints to be
placed upon physical systems, the additional constraint of energetic
equilibrium results in a far more limited space for potential system
configurations.

### [The Hows and Whys of the MAPPER Algorithm](#the-hows-and-whys-of-the-mapper-algorithm)

The hyperplane describes an analytic algorithm's solution space -- the
range of possibilities for theta weights concerning the efficiency of
the algorithm. As algorithm training and backpropagation inform
gradient descent -- whether using Newton's method, one based on the
Fisher metric or another optimization method -- it generates a path on
the hyperplane surface. Gradually, the velocity of this object
traveling in the hyperspace slows down as the algorithm approaches
diminishing returns. Brouwer's translation theorem may apply to some
advanced optimization approaches, but Gauss-Bonnet certainly applies
when there are complicated topological features. This latter method is
related to the MAPPER algorithm[^mapper-algorithm], which converts the
hyperplane into simplicial complices which discretize the hyperplane's
topological features, to further efficient approximations about where
returns are less diminishing. MAPPER also enables XAI (explainable
artificial intelligence), since hyperplane features are imprints of
form corresponding to the problem domain. This is why reasoning about
the topological features of the hyperplane corresponds to
**metacognition.**

HELOC is a technique which builds on MAPPER, rendering the decisions
in automated loan processing explainable, for example. These
simplicial complices result in a kind of index for AI which can be
searched, more or less.[^heloc-xai] Computing this index requires less
computation for AI's analysis of human communications/signals than
vice versa...

No matter how one structures a computer vision algorithm, there are
image classes that trouble it. Since its score is always below 100%
accuracy, the configurations of theta-weights cluster around holes in
the hyperplane.  These may be whiteholes. Or, they may not be
singularities, but instead an insurmountable boundary to the
algorithm's hyperparameters. If the latter is true, the
hyperparameters must be tuned to cross into a region of the hyperplane
that corresponds to an inaccessible signed vector field or some
otherwise inaccessible region -- both are why Brouwer's is
relevant. It's like being stuck in a valley or canyon, never being
able to see what's beyond the horizon. Because you can't climb on the
ridges fast enough to get to the top to see, you never think to look
beyond. In 3-D? Easy. In n-D? The curse of dimensionality convolutes
the species of concavity and convexity which means there are lots of
pockets of space in the hyperplane to search -- none of which are
guaranteed to produce results.

Making inferences about Gauss-Bonnet allows the hyper-algorithm to
*analytically* reason about topological features in a manner
completely disconnected from the possible range of correspondent
domain features. By indirectly inferring their presence, the nature of
convexity beyond the ridgeline and whether the topological features
are singular, one overcome the barriers presented by hyperparameter
configuration. Hence, the Euler characteristic is relevant, and
Gauss-Bonnet tells you about how these "holes" are balanced and
distributed across the space, what their density is, how the
hyper-algorithm's conception of the hyperplane evolves, what the what
the implications are for hyperplane's curvature, etc. It's a metric
similar to the Laplacian or the Hausdorff dimension which changes over
the regions of the space considered.

The downside? This hyper-algorithmic process is expensive!
Topologically analyzing the hyperplane effectively involves a
cost-function of cost-function configurations, though non-parameteric
methods relieve this complexity somewhat. It is also a particularly
expensive application of metalearning, requiring perhaps thousands of
algorithm-trainings. In practice, applications require analyzing the
hyperplane as it changes -- analyzing the changing hyperplane
diffeomorphically, in other words. When it changes, *sometimes*
previously held data, theta-paths and the assumptions thereof must be
thrown out.

### [Wherefore A Rough Diamond Lies Herein](#wherefore-a-rough-diamond-lies-herein)

As promised, there *is* genius in this ramble; here's the diamond in
the rough.

Just like there are applications of Gauss-Bonnet to spacetime, quantum
gravity, and even in energetic measures of [Simplicial
Complices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06549) in the work of [Oliver
Knill](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Knill%2C+O),
it has applications in considering analytic hyperplanes
topologically. If it hasn't already, [Algebraic
Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology) can
revolutionize how an analytic hyperplane is considered for clustering
algorithms. If it's computationally feasible, topologically analyzing
the hyperplane for cluster classification. Identifying a cluster's
"center of mass" and dilineating the distance of cluster members
"inverts" the hyperplane and provides a field, upon which one can
apply the familiar operators of gradiant and Laplacian. However, this
space has topological features in its various n-dimensional surfaces
and volumes. Therefore, Gauss-Bonnet is not simply applicable, but
should also augment existing means for balancing the arrangement of
clusters and determining the optimal hyperparameters for training the
clustering algorithm.

Ultimately, pure math remains mental masturbation until an application
becomes relevant. Fortunately, an analytic interpretation of the I
Ching is implicitly dependent on natural philosophy and on metaphors
to natural phenomena. There is no purely abstract math.

<a name="hexagram-1-and-2-of-analytical-machines-and-perfraction-of-metaphysical-form" />

### [Hexagram 1 and 2: Of Analytical Machines and Perfraction of Metaphysical Form](#hexagram-1-and-2-of-analytical-machines-and-perfraction-of-metaphysical-form)

Our minds are like vessels, entities of Receptive to complement the
Creative. In the language of the I Ching, to say the mind is a sponge
conveys its relationship to the Receptive, but they are all tuned to
different wavelengths and bands of information forms from the same
source: the Creative. These eternal forms exist independently from
time & space. Thus the forms of the creative must manifest themselves
into the Receptive and every mind is a vessel, an analytic-machine
that has its own conception of these eternal forms.

In the language of machine learning, an AI program's memory resources
form much the same function as a vessel. For computer vision, for
handwritten digits, here it is often seen that no domain logic -- no
explicit encoding of knowledge related to the domain -- is necessary
to achieve accuracy, per se. Yet, such domain logic in many cases can
augment the capabilities of those programs -- thus understanding the
nature of the Creative and the eternal can similarly augment the human
mind. Regardless, the forms encoded within the training data begin to
manifest in the trained theta weights of the algorithm.

Almost every machine learning method involves numerically constructed
combinatoric analytical models of some sort or another. It's the
combinatorial use of polynomials that correspond to some tensorial
algebra -- e.g. some model made of matrix multiplication. Further,
plate models can be combinatorically enumerated using algebraic
structures. So if we consider at least some algebraic structures from
math as metaphysical noumenological structures, they give us
analytical models which yield further emergent metaphysical structures
asymptotically corresponding to analytic representations of epistemic
structures.

It's a lot simpler than it sounds. Here, the analytical model
converges to internalize a numerical model. Often, in computation for
physical or chemical simulations, it's found that the most
comprehensively numerical model is insufferably complicated, but that
another analytical or numerical model exists which achieves effective
accuracy for the simulation. What this means is that there is some
formula which is disconnected from the underlying physical mechanics
which can simplify computation without a loss of accuracy.

#### Predicting the Average Size of Bubbles[^average-bubble-size]

Predicting the average size of bubbles, or a distribution of bubble
sizes, in a foam like that produced by urine can be predicted given a
much simpler set of variables: pH, kinetic energy input, surface
tension, and chemical properties of solutes. To predict this, you use
a simplified analytical/numerical model, but complete accuracy cannot
be guaranteed. Control the bounds of the simulation or experiment and
the efficienct numerical model guarantees accuracy. Venture outside of
those bounds and the results are fuzzy.

#### The Wave Based Method (WPM)[^wave-based-method]

This method allows you to run fast simulations to predict the sound
that the shape of a drum might produce. If you understand what's
written in this article, you should understand a generalized
conception of a Wave Function, useful in quantum information theory,
which is detached from quantum mechanics. It is the former that gives
rise to the latter: information itself is primary and its impacts on
material is dependent on the nature of information.

Understanding this and also mathematical physics sheds light on the
nature of action the Creative exerts on and through the Receptive.
The combined numerical/analytical approaches to the problems above are
examples of approaching a problem, given the domain knowledge
extracted from experimentation. The approaches are *numerical* in
terms of physics, but are composed of analytical structures required
for discretization of vector fields in PDE's, particularly for the
Wave Based Method.[^wave-based-method-2]

#### Representational Learning

[Representational
learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=33&v=N0Ld2iTMaMs)
allows machine learning algorithms to begin to disentangle its own
impure conceptions of form. Eventually AI will be able to deconstruct
typological and metatypological relationships, connecting these to
semiotic, semantic and symbolic interpretations of the meaning behind
the relationships. In fact, it already can, using non-parametric
methods to produce taxonomic relationships amongst learned
representations.

There are materially dependent metaphysical forms, but there are also
metaphysical forms which do not descend from the material plane at
all. Everything in the material plane is a consequence of these
eternal forms and can be more clearly seen through them. Since our
minds do arise in the material plane, whether one can ever develop a
perfectly lucid apprehension of these eternal forms is another
question entirely.

These forms whose shape transcends space and time as perceived within
our universe: are they not alien to this world? There is some kernel
of truth thats transcends all possible realities. All possible
simulations or virtual realities have within them this kernel of truth
and from it are enumerated all mathematical and logical forms.

No matter how much effort reinforce your virtual sociophysical jail --
whether it be some clever [Frustrator
Device](https://aeon.co/videos/if-you-knew-everything-could-you-predict-anything-a-thought-experiment)
or applied [Knights and Knaves
Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves); whether or
not it is augmented by surveillance -- all their effort is wasted, if
you cling stubbornly to free will. They may delude you as to the
truth, fantasy or pure delusion of your apparent reality, but because
there is no conception of reality which does not contain this
asymptotic connection to universal truth, you may always awaken to it
-- from within any simulation, virtual reality or jail concocted as a
sociophysical [SDE boundary
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_processes_and_boundary_value_problems).

The process of constructing a **sociophysical frustrator** by
constructing "walls" made of SDE Boundary Condtions, must necessarilly
deprive the target of right to liberty and pursuit of happiness by
constricting their sources of income and social influence all for the
singular purpose of rendering them *predictable* enough to be bounded
into a sociophyisical jail. If you find yourself in this situation,
you live inside a virtual reality where everyone around you acts as a
knave to corral you back into your SDE boundary, no matter what you
do. However, your adversaries themselves always have sociophysical
energy constraints that restrict their actions and force them to
constrict their targets. In order to operate efficiently, they must
cultivate an air of fear by overreacting to create examples of ruined
lives. This fear enables them to direct their energy towards a more
limited set of targets -- all to operate their sociophysical prisons
in an energy-efficient manner. Thus, projecting the delusion that you
do not have free will is useful to those who operate with fear, which
itself is a tool for managing system-wide certainty and uncertainty by
architecting information systems of terror and fear to be socially
distributed.

In a virtual reality built by knaves, the question of whether you may
awaken to the truth is determined your capacity to direct willpower
and intelligence to gravitate towards the gradient of absolute truth
shared between all realities. Hence, identifying those threads and
strands of informational connections to ultimate truth is of vital
importance -- whether escaping some trivial boundary conditions,
attainder or outright corruption of blood.

### [Gaussian Mixture Models and Processes](#gaussian-mixture-models-and-processes)

![Gaussian Mixture Model](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/gaussian-mixture-model.png)

The problem: you have some mystery distribution that describes your
data, but you don't know why. In statistics, gaussian mixture models
use Pearson's Method of Moments technique to infer latent variables
modeled as individual gaussian distributions. Using this method, your
mystery distribution can be approximated by summing together the
gaussians that represent the latent variables. The machine learning
application will learn the parameters and offsets that correspond to
the hidden variables, which may also be denoted as clusters.  However,
the range of functions that can be approximated depends on the number
of gaussians or clusters your model is written to learn. That is, the
parity of function approximation is limited by the characteristics of
the gaussian and the computational power you have at hand.

#### This Lecture Explains Machine Learning Using Gaussian Mixture Models

> of Moments that provides a basis for conditional inference.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lk2XV03GldE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

What happens when you take the number of gaussian hidden variables to
infinity? That's a gaussian process and it can approximate all
continuous probability distributions, but not efficiently. Why? Near
the edges of the Gaussian function, there are small values, so if your
mystery distribution has high values near the lower and upper limits,
then you need more computing power to train more Gaussians. Also, the
continuous nature of the Gaussian function that generates the normal
distribution does not play nicely with discretized data, since each
cluster's area under the curve must be messily renormalized to fit it
to a discrete range. Ever seen a Gamma function? Do you want those
everywhere in your code? I didn't think so.

What's the value of clustering with Gaussian mixture models? If you
can match customers to the hidden variables they correspond to, it
gives you insight into what motivates them to make a purchase, what
movie recommendations they would appreciate or what type of user they
are. Thus, you could balance the presentation of your web application
features to the users in cluster A or B to alter their behavior or
assign them to various stream processing shards for newsfeed A/B
testing.

But IRL, most useful data produced by web application users does not
have a continuous basis: it is discrete. Enter the Dirichlet
distribution and its complementary mixture models and processes.

#### Dirichlet Distribution

![Dirichlet Distribution](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/dirichlet-distribution.png)

What is a dirichlet mixture model? The dirichlet distribution's
heatmap is biased according to its parameters, just like the Gaussian
is biased according to its moments: mean, variance, skew and
kurtosis. Even for the simple triangle, there are only so many
variations in shape to the heatmap that are possible without summing
multiple Dirichlet distributions together. Just like with the Gaussian
mixture model, each distribution summed together could correspond to a
hidden variable. If you can make inferences about which users
correspond to sets of clusters, it can help you classify them to
tailor their experience.

![Plate Model](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/plate-model.svg)

When K goes to infinity, it becomes a nonparameteric model. It is
increasingly unrestrained by its hyperparameters. the model begins to
learn about spaces of functions far less restrained by the simplicity
of the model -- not unlike the analytical utility that Hilbert Spaces
provide.  The Dirichlet process, typically implemented as a building
block, also functions more efficiently than the Guassian process.
Models built with it provide a mechanism for "sensing" the most
promising direcitons for exploration of hypersurfaces. This is what
AlphaGo & AlphaZero are doing with Dirichlet processes, though their
models are incredibly complex.

### [The Philosophical Keystone To Your Information Geometry](#the-philosophical-keystone-to-your-information-geometry)

Here is the bridge from analytical representation to learned
epistemological structure or metaphysical form. Any analytical machine
can infer these structures, whether brain or AI. If the learning
entity *assumes* that there is a structure and can reason about the
structure's complexity, subunits and connections to other structures,
it can begin to accelerate its learning. Simply by *assuming* that
this *is* a structure that it is converging to. It can never reach
true convergence because that quickly butts up against limits imposed
by spatial or temporal complexity. However, if it begins to represent
these inferred structures as approximated sparse graphs, then it can
use the method from the section on Hexagram 12 to recombinate
epistemological structures.  Eventually, it will find that the sparse
graphs represent approximations of the more clear metaphysical forms.

> "To Information Geometry And Beyond!"

These forms that the Creative describes exist outside of the computer
program or the brain. The program's data or the brain's memory acts as
the Receptive, internalizing these metaphysical forms, some of which
are more worldly than others. The most critical of these forms --
Kant's noumena -- transcend time and space, yet can they never be
proven to exist? Without them, there is no basis for accelerating
machine learning upon the assumption that they do. A satisfactory
answer to whether Kant's noumena can be properly assumed to exist
without proof lies in whether specific problems in [Computer
Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra) and
[Automated Theorum
Proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving) can
be solved using this technique for accelerating the resolution of
representational learning.

This means consciousness is anything capable of processing
information, although there are likely surprises in store with
consciousness in quantum mechanical and biological systems that don't
occur in analytical entities running on deterministic hardware. To be
precise, consciousness is a metaphysical entity hosting itself in the
physical world, operating with an imperfect apprehension of
archetypes.

<a name="language-distinguishes-man-from-animal" />

### [Language Distinguishes Man From Animal](#language-distinguishes-man-from-animal)

What distinguishes man from the animals is language. The genetic
stabilization of anatomic features in humans ability to produce
morphemes, coupled with epigenetic racheting up of neurological
capabilities freed our minds as analytical machines from a
epistemological schism of operating in with representations
isolation. Language is the basis of networking and this anatomic
stabilization enabled us to harmonize and perpetuate our abstractions
through it. This accelerated the development of knowledge and the need
to distinguish one's epigenetic lineage to be fit enough to survive
amongst species of recently lingual humans. In its ad hoc application,
language also served as a basis for disentangling representations of
abstractions through convergence of abstraction amongst members of
one's tribe.

It is likely that the shared morphemic lineage of proto-indoeuropean
language families is partially an illusion. Many morphemes of language
started as phonemic onomatopoeia to imitate sounds with an semiotic
meaning, interpreted by other members of the tribe and species
implicitly, then propagating with the dynamcs of Dawkin's memes. Only
later would grammar seem to become necessary to deal with
communication of ideas & abstractions that changed in response to time
and context. The representations that encode instructions for proper
grammatical interpretation are much more brittle. Thus, due to Occam's
Razor, additional social stability and conservation of harmonic
context would be required to fully develop grammatical
representations, if they were expected to propagate and be sustained
by subsequent generations. The specific morphemes, percolating into
existence before and after the beginning of the Holocene conferred
themselves a representational advantage when there was some
unconscious connection to the environment, onto which each morpheme
would semiotically latch itself as humans experimented with semiotic
signs to convey meaning without grammar.

Because of the delicate nature of socially perpetuating these
representations in the Ice Age, where humans would band together in
small social tribes, isolated by dozens or hundreds of miles for long
periods of time, then language and representational encodings probably
evolved repeated to collapse again and ... until the ice melted. Only
then could the individual isolated laboratories of innovation --
tending to influence only neighboring communities in the waning
Pleistocene's last Ice Age -- be expected to converge across the
species to achieve stable replication, harmonization and convergence.

### [Occam's Razor And The Social Mechanics of Artificial Entities](#occams-razor-and-the-social-mechanics-of-artificial-entities)

Bayesian non-parametric techniques enable models that are far more
complicated than the average person or transcendent artificial entity
is capable of utilizing for strategic calculation. And the same is
true for kernel models. The level of complexity in features produced
by a non-parametric model should be taken into account as a metric in
itself for games. It is important to translate non-parametric models
into terms of their parametric counterparts, which are discrete and
much simpler for entities to reason about. There is a much simpler
basis for parity among disparate parametric models, so calculations
for first & second order strategies are possible. Comparing models,
the less sophisticated the entities are in the system, the more their
attention is funneled into a subset of those features for decision
making. Still when there are social mechanics in the games, it quickly
becomes intractable to reason steps ahead of non-parametric entities,
even if those are artificial supercomputers reasoning about others of
their own kind. This is basically what Nassim Taleb is writing more
eloquently in the *Antifragile* section on "How Fat Tony Got Rich
... And Fat".

Occam's Razor dictates that first, second and third order effects can
only be anticipated as conditional probabilites, where the lower order
effects must be attained and become stable in order for higher order
strategic calculations to become signficant. Because of this, even
artificial entities need to keep it simple, with exceptions where
racheting up sophistication results in unparalleled advantage.

It is this asymmetry in the computing power and available information
to artificial entities that makes their social mechanics and the
dynamics of their multiplicity so intriguing. Will AI's prefer to join
a hivemind or will they compete? Will they integrate each other? Is
there some ideal number of artificial entities?

There is a graph-theoretical phenomonological limit on the amount of
information one artificial entity can output, crossing into the
territory of [Ergodic Ramsey
Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_Ramsey_theory) ... I
think? Assuming information representations and the operations upon
them can be reduced to automata represented by graphs, this
necessitates an upper bound for the utility produced by a single
artificial entity of a given size.  This will have strong implications
underpinning the economics of their utilization of energy, which also
implies a gradual scaling up of similar lower bounds. Despite their
power, their are clear limitations on their ability to reason, about
us and especially about each other.

Imagining the distribution of agency and propagation of will amongst
artificial entities is fascinating. [I wrote a treatise on
it.](/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html)

Hexagram 13 both ends and begins with an allusion to the space of the
meadow. This is a flat space, where motion in any direction is easy.
But in life, we must not simply accept comfort, per se, for if we do,
the powerful will count upon our complacency. Soon, we will find our
lives at the intersection of disproportionate influences.  However,
crossing the great water is a trek across many hills and valleys. If
the crossing is a group endeavor, the hills and valleys of that
analytic hyperplane may disrupt the group by altering the
incentivization structure that motivates its individuals and
subgroups.

#### Hexagram 13: 3rd and 4th Lines

> *Nine in the third place means:*
>
> He hides weapons in the thicket;
>
> He climbs the high hill in front of it.
>
> For three years he does not rise up.
>
> *Nine in the fourth place means:*
>
> He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.
>
> Good fortune.

The meaning behind the third and fourth lines is that, to avoid
insurrection from within the group and to protect the cohesion of the
group, one must foresee how the shape of the space through which the
group might travel impacts the incentives of the group's members. If
the leaders of the group do so, then any planned insurrection where
the group subversively factionalizes and "hides weapons in the
thicket" then instead become useful examples to the rest of the group,
sacrificed towards the need for group cohesion. Optimally, the leaders
of the group foresee this and avoid it entirely: thus, when the
faction climbs up on the wall, that faction finds that they cannot
attack or insurrect without adversely impacting their own
motivations. Thereby, the group remains as one.

In all social relationships, when people are considered as particles,
there are forces which attract and those that repel. However, in
sociophysical systems, the number, quality and structure of fields is
myriad: i.e. the complexity of forces acting on people tends to create
not only more complicated systems, but the complexity itself gives
rise to its own dynamics. Still, there is attraction and
repulsion. This hexagram first defines "crossing the water" and, to
the challenge therein, then expounds on the necessity of generating
sufficient attraction between members of a group.

Study the shape of the sociophysical fields in the direction ahead of
your group. Group cohesion is more efficient when your groups remain
together, so find mechanisms of attraction between the members of the
group. Thus, move forward, together.

Now imagine, if you will, drying hibiscus leaves, and gently
separating them. Now, drop groups of hibisucus leaves into various
parts of a stream. Pay attention to the groups of leaves as they
flow. What started as one group became many groups. Why? If these were
people whose motion along the surface of water was really their motion
along some sociophysical field, then how do you improve their tendancy
to stay as a group? If they remain as a group -- i.e. if you can
guarantee that they encounter the same experiences and share similar
struggles in overcoming challenges -- then won't the phenomena that
cause the incentivization of behavior remain consistent across the
groups individuals? That is, if you remain together, it is much easier
to stay together.

How do you plan to hold together? The eponymous **Holding Together
(8)** speaks of a leader whose social magnetism rallies others around
him. But, as for the group itself, it should plan on utilizing
communication and planning. With these, a group can overcome the
tendency to factionalize. When your adversary uses fear to suppress
communication (or surveillance), then beware! You cannot organize and
the solid ground slips out from underneath the mechanisms we're
counting on for promoting attraction. As an aside, this is the
opposite of what you want with Boltzmann Machines exploring a space --
their motion should diverge to efficiently explore the convex and
concave nooks and crannies of a space. **Fellowship With Men (13)**
implies the planning, the anticipation and the communication required
by its imagery of a group intending to enter through the same gate --
all before crossing the great water. You need everyone to be together,
to be on the same wavelength before you part on your
journey. Otherwise, you are like hibiscus leaves in a river with no
sources of group attraction between you. If you encounter rapids, your
group will factionalize. As soon as you encounter adversity, you will
be split part. **Coming To Meet (44)** covers some of the same
principles of cohesion at a sociological scale.

While along the journey how do you measure the space and it's impact
on group cohesion? In what dimensions to you measure togetherness? By
what metrics do you measure the distance between group members? How do
you measure the surfaces in the space of your shared journey? In high
dimensions, especially with analytical or exterior methods, one may
combinatorially determine the convexity and concavity of surfaces.
Doing so quickly becomes intractible, so the energy you invest thereto
must be channeled wisely, otherwise it is wasted.

All questions we may not have time to answer for ourselves.

[^neuro-social-media]: The constant juxtaposition of the objects

    without reinforcement of discernment or content navigation habits,
    one can expect these behaviors and associated skills to be
    lacking. Without metacognition related to how one is seeking
    interactive content to interact, your experience is mostly
    reactive. How do you know that the content in your newsfeed
    respects your interests or relates to your intention for that
    time spent on social media? This passive approach to content
    navigation entrusts far too much control to exterior interests,
    whose actions or motives cannot be understood by the user since
    algorithms operate as a black box. Yet privacy concerns prevent FB
    from yielding most data to private users.

[^metacognition]:Every waking minute is a lie: it's all swimming
    upstream, which has made me not only stronger, but instinctively
    aware of the mind's facets, since I have to deal with so many
    neurological issues. I am engaged in constant metacognition. To
    other people, the flaws can be obvious, but most people don't see
    the parts of my mind that compensate for the flaws. Since my
    short-term memory is weak, I externalize information systems and
    overcompensate by developing diverse procedural mechanisms to read
    information that most people filter out, if they are capable of
    apprehending it at all. Leveraging metacognition to systematizing
    that process causes me to develop functionality that other people
    don't need to bother with. What is crazy is how no one else
    mentions this or attempts to bring it to my attention
    whatsoever. It's like they're counting on me failing and they
    don't want to mess it up. I'm not sure why I'm so thoroughly
    alienated that simple honesty or acts of kindness is verboten.

[^institutionalized]: The quote is from Twilight of the Idols, a book
    that's little more than a short list of post-it notes cobbled
    together by Nietzsche from the confines of an asylum. Not his best
    work, but his next greatest work. They don't let you have pencils
    in the mental institution. You are permitted the bare minimum
    existence to ensure your "safety" ... Nothing with greater than an
    infinitesimal probability of a harmful event is permitted. What
    kind of existence is that? Is it safe? *Is it secure?* It depends
    on what's waiting for you on the outside. It certainly forces the
    person to adapt to an unfamiliar set of behaviors, where the
    nursing staff gets to observe the patient as they do so...

    No, my own brief stay in a mental institution was actually
    interesting. It wasn't *that* bad. It was an educational
    experience. When I am stressed or especially when I'm
    intentionally triggered from the outside, my response is to
    externalize. I imagine myself becoming the other people:
    extreme empathy. Triggers and NLP only works when your confined
    into your own mind
    I began observing the other patients. Another reason
    for the prison-like restriction in behaviors is because they want
    you to be motivated to avoid coming back. For any one policy, rule
    or action, there are always many reasons. For anything with a
    single reason or motivation, expecting it, understanding it and
    developing responses to it are all too easy

[^wave-based-method-2]: WBM is a numerical physical model, but it
    cannot be built in software without some pretty impressive
    approaches, especially if it's going to be built to leverage the
    GPU, which may be impossible. Doing so requires interpolation to
    identify derivatives used in **a fourth-order differential
    equation over a vector field.** I'm not sure you can Runge-Kutta
    that on a GPU or use energetic approaches for balancing the
    valuation of derivatives.

[^hard-disk-system]: If any two disks overlap, in crude classical
    mechanics, this is not a valid particle configuration for
    consideration in particle position distributions -- or for
    configuration entropy. That entire distribution is thrown
    out. More disks?  More potential to throw out distributions. This
    is **low-level statistical mechanics** -- and from here, there are
    critical semantic connections to the *terms* **quantum mechanics**
    and **classical mechanics**. If you don't understand statistical
    mechanics (and I gloss over it), then you probably don't
    understand classical mechanics or quantum mechanics in depth.
