When people choose to define their own will independently of the
existing power, seek the cultivation of a will to power for
self-actualization, enable others to pursue such transformation, then
the society as a whole and mankind become collectively stronger.
Moreover, those who independently determine their needs, desires and
crucially the means whereby such are attained cannot be predicted or
understood. It is so unlikely for an individual to possess all of the
characteristics outlined in Will to Power (976) - while also pushing
ever forward towards true progress in philosophy - without having
their energy coopted by societal power structures.

That philosophy can never move forwards in an authentic direction is a
product of insurmountable complexity combined with Neitzsche's [Danger
of Dangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE67Ye91Ii0q). The
required complexity renders it exceedingly unlikely that anyone could
ever deconstruct existing ideas to reconstruct them into some truly
novel basis. Existing moral systems are frightened by the prospect of
any such authentic move forwards in philosophy, if it is to be
significant -- but never in human history have the stakes been higher.

Why would a man with so many skills be employable, yet writing? And
about how to think, of all things -- who needs another Plato? If he is
useful, put him to work. If he's dangerous, where does he work? If he
resonates with the times, why does he find himself so superfluous?

# [Das Lied des Notwendigen](#das-lied-des-notwendigen)

The linguistic implications of Neitzsches choice of
[überflüssig](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/überflüssig) (from latin,
[superfluus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/superfluus)) are
contradicatory: both who he who is overflowing and he who is
unneeded. Both phrases "Überflüssig" and “Das Lied des Notwendigen”
seem to be translated without granularity into english, but both are
critical to a proper reading of Neitzsche, whose work decompresses
with paradoxical implications abound. Nothing satisfies, with
Nietzsche. Nothing ever will. It is this blind lust to strive forward
-- while overcoming every stumbling block, lilliputian and pleasant
sidestreet -- that transforms humanity.

> From "Elfen Lied"

![Elfen Lied](/img/posts/2019-04-10-the-highest-man-as-the-lawgiver-of-the-future/nyu-elfen-lied.jpg)

In his masterpiece Zarasthustra, Nietzsche is essentially saying the
überflüssig are those outside of or without leverage over channels of
influence who are unnecessary or dispensable to those who have access
to such channels/influence. Instead these dispensable people are
unneeded by those who control their circumstances, but instead develop
a need to become needed by those above them -- particularly in the
context of the State in “The New Idol”. i.e. No one needs them except
to use them, but as they are unable to fulfill their needs
independently, the superfluous develop a dependent relationship to the
more powerful, to whom they are dispensable. It is those above such
überflüssig people who define how and whether their needs will be met:
they are dispensible to those in power. Such a system caps its
evolutionary potential because the weak exist to serve the powerful
who feed themselves and weed out what is threatening or isn’t
useful.

### [But The State Lieth In All Languages Of Good And Evil](#but-the-state-lieth-in-all-languages-of-good-and-evil)

#### From Thus Spoke Zarasthustra, The New Idol

> "This sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its language of
> good and evil: this its neighbour understandeth not. Its language
> hath it devised *for itself* in laws and customs.
>
> But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever
> it saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen."

*Unless specifically addressed through the architecture of the
culture* -- which is among the sociocultural implications of
Nietzsche's work -- then such a system sacrifices advancement of the
collective for the supposed benefit of the collective. In "The New
Idol", Nietzsche seems to imply both that the state was designed for
the überflüssig, the superfluous, and designed to produce them for its
purposes.

#### From Thus Spoke Zarasthustra, The New Idol

> "Confusion of language of good and evil; this sign i give unto you
> as the sign of the state. Verily, the will to death, indicateth this
> sign!"

Nietzsche writes that the state speaks in a kind of one-sided
meta-language of values, the true comprehension of which escapes its
neighbors. This is implicit language of action and effect of action --
the state which feeds itself does so by deceiving its citizens and its
neighbors: they are fooled by its system of values and the explicit
language a state uses to justify its actions -- i.e. the language of
its laws and customs.

### [Nietzsche's Sociocultural Dynamo to Transform Volatility For Great Übermenschen](#nietzsches-sociocultural-dynamo-to-transform-volatility-for-great-ubermenschen)

To prevent the state from extinguishing its own fire through
stagnation, it must architect social systems that encourage both a
healthy level of conflict and a healthy response to conflict. Similar
to the notion of how financial engineers architect systems to benefit
from a healthy level of economic volatility, then to promote evolution
of the collective, a state or culture must devise means of capturing
the energy from the dissonance of sociocultural conflict at the
individual level. Such a dynamo converts this dissonance into a means
to allow its individuals to evolve and become stronger. Nassim Taleb
would say "Don't be so neurotic", so live to learn and learn to
thrive. Be antifragile and orient yourself to grow stronger from every
hit you take.

The passive aggressive tactics of the far left -- e.g. short circuit
mild conflict through isolation and obfuscation, while leveraging
intersectionalism to disempower specific social groups -- are toxic in
the long run. By the way, your guerilla theatre[^guerilla-theater] may
have created a costly tail event that your value system cannot justify
having contributed to. See the footnote for a complete explanation.
You should have communicated to me and acquired information. You do
not understand me, so you should not have targeted me. No one on any
side understands me. I write to be understood not today, but in the
future.

### ["More Precisely, We Are Never Understood -- Hence Our Authority"](#more-precisely-we-are-never-understood-hence-our-authority)

> Can we say ... "Thanks, Nietzsche!"

In the context of the New Idol, “Das Lied des Notwendigen” refers to
those who are independent. Literally, it means "the song of the
necessary ones", from *Notwendig* which means "the *agile* ones,
needed to avert the distress", the ones whose independence and
capacity for fluid agency fills in the gaps. Their needs are not
defined by others and thus neither are the goals/objectives they seek
to attain to meet such needs. Since their needs, desires, and
objectified behaviors are neither typical nor are they so externally
defined, the evolutionary potential of such individuals is much
greater. The "lied" of the necessary ones is their song, which is what
serves to amplify their presence in society. When individuals become
complacent, this begets behavior and character qualities which are
contrary to flexibility of the necessary ones. *Das Lied des
Notwendig* is the opposite of the siren song: it is a rallying cry to
cultivate values and sociophysical potential energy necessary for
action not today, but in the future. Do your enemies tomorrow want you
to be culturally awake and strong or weak and sleeping?

<a name="the-siren-song-of-cultural-marxism" />

### [The Siren Song of Cultural Marxism](#the-siren-song-of-cultural-marxism)

The siren song is cultural marxism and our enemies will not hesitate
to debase our culture to butter us up for subjugation. We must define
our own values on our terms. Only when we can secure our economic
independence and sovereignty can we hope to push other cultural issues
forward in society. Just watch what happens to the transgender rights
movement after economic collapse: only when other more pertainent
national interests are secured do these issues move forward to attain
permanent progress. The correct way to move these issues forward is
*slowly and steadily*, but instead we are forgetting our priorities,
falling asleep at the wheel and thus enabling the future backslide of
these social issues.

### [Neo-Leninists Care Not About Your Economy Nor Your Social Issues](#neo-leninists-care-not-about-your-economy-nor-your-social-issues)

Causing an enemy to neglect their economic and geopolitical
imperatives while bickering amid sociocultural chaos is how cultural
marxism is weaponized to butter up an enemy for subjugation. The
subject of a future article, disnormalization systemically drives
sociocultural and socioeconomic uncertainty, which leads to distrust,
lack of cooperation, factionalization and the breakdown of
strategy. Times where prosperty reigns are the times where
sociocultural evolution can proceed sustainably. Guarantee prosperity
first and you guarantee the potential for social change. Society
focuses the collective social energies of individuals by directing
their attention. Cultural marxism and other pragmatic neo-leninist
tools short-circuit a society's ability to guarantee prosperty by
diverting the collective attention of individuals away from economic
and geopolitical imperatives. For leninism to secure a revolution, an
economic collapse is necessary and engineered by the most radical
elements. The collapse guarantees that sociocultural issues that the
moderate left cares deeply about will suffer a tremendous
backslide. The most radical far-left really does not care about who
gets hurt in society as long as they gain power.

When people choose to define their own will independently of the

the society as a whole and mankind become collectively stronger.
Moreover, those who independently determine their needs, desires and

### [Define Yourself](#define-yourself)

Make yourself independent. Define your own terms. Put yourself and
your neighbors in win-win positions. When everyone is lives in a
society that rewards and creates self-reliance, everyone benefits and
everyone is independent. This does not imply that individuals should
be distant and self-concerned, but that we should have the freedom to
live on our own terms, so that we have the options to avoid
victimization by coerced circumstances and exploitative values
systems. Do not simply trust promising politicians: they are selling
you a one-size-fits-all hammer to nail you down to exploitative
circumstances. The economy cannot support centrally financed
government programs to solve everyone's problems. What results is a
bureaucratic nightmare, the policies and regulations of which require
weeks of study in themselves and which you will not have the power to
change. Regardless of whether the sociohierarchical structure is
business oriented or a social institution, power flows up to the
top. The Bolsheviks soon found that their precious revolution simply
made them serfs to a new master.

Power is power is power!

### [What Adam Smith Would Write Today: Capitalism Is Emergent Machine Learning](#what-adam-smith-would-write-today-capitalism-is-emergent-machine-learning)

Financial mechanisms of influence enable you to store financial
potential energy the direction of which you determine. When leftist
regimes deprive you of right to property and the ability to save
money, you are deprived of independence. Perhaps the economic collapse
necessitated by leninist ideology replaced the old masters, but it
changes nothing: you are still proletariats. The difference is that
you only have social and information mechanisms to influence society,
since communism implies financial resources are "shared". Communist
regimes are still bound by capitalism, since they must manage their
economic externalities. The difference lies in the domestic economics,
as it relates to the individual, who loses the ability to store
financial resources, which are far less ephemeral than social or
informational resources. Since the success or failure of their regimes
are fated from the start by their economic externalities, they doom
themselves when they bureaucratize away the ability of individuals and
domestic economic entities to be agile. Capalitism literally is the
IRL implementation of machine learning algorithms to seek efficient
solutions to problems of supply and demand. It is not free of
problems, but without that emergent property of domestic economic
entities auto-magickally seeking efficient solutions via IRL "machine
learning", the domestic mismanagement of a command economy tends to
create a disaster. And the individual has NO POWER to coooperate
collectively to change the fate of their nation.

### [Processes of Social Change Are Subject To The Boom and Bust Cycle](#processes-of-social-change-are-subject-to-the-boom-and-bust-cycle)

When the conduits of influence in large societies constrain
independent will, prune away the nontypical and consume the
dispensable, then agents within such a system will behave with more
singular will. This enables greater accomplishment towards the goals
of the higher social echelons of that group, but paradoxically limits
the long-term evolutionary trajectory of that social group. If such
concerns are not augmented by artificial initiatives to balance
singular oneness with the diversity of experience that advances the
goal beyond competition and externalities, then any state or social
group will crash like a wave whose crest has fallen. The strength of
the maximum tidal flow of a group merely determines the strength of
the diverging riptides that pull it apart into a vacuously minimal
ebb, awaiting the next such social tsunami. These social dynamics are
not unlike the financial dynamics leading to the as-yet-aeternal
business cycle of boom and bust. However, it is possible to attain
such singular oneness while accelerating evolutionary mechanisms. And
I believe that is what Nietzsche was writing about.

[^guerilla-theater]: Being a victim of street theatre combined with
    hypnosis and NLP, let me tell you: [guerrilla
    theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_theatre) is a
    disease. It deprives people of the chance to respond and
    encourages cognitive bias amongst its members and "audience", all
    while fostering toxic long-term tail risks. Information is
    good. Deception in the form of guerilla theatre manufactures bad
    information and leads to bad decisions. The far-leftist tactic of
    guerilla theatre intends to leverage cognitive bias in the minds
    of the movements' less radical members, to create the monster it
    wishes they believed existed. To engage in this is to promote the
    artificial creation of that which your espoused values system
    implies you detest. For far-leftists, it provides a useful means
    of "hazing" members and stratifying its members for willingness to
    "engage" the enemy. But to me, these tactics invalidate your
    supposed credibility. The dissonance between your intent and your
    portrayal of intent is disgusting, not to mention *that the actual
    outcomes you are creating could be the exact opposite of what your
    values system claims is paramount*. You are not ridding the world
    of racism, you are empowering it and enabling intersectionalist
    conflict to justify radical action. If you cannot accurately
    understand the actual outcomes you are creating or must deceive
    your members into creating adverse outcomes, what justification do
    you have for gaining power for social engineering?
