# [The Essence of Things](#the-essence-of-things)

What is change, without state? What is the meaning of state, without
change? What is the meaning of either, without time? What phenomena
can be seen as constant without the possibility of change? Without the
possibility of time or sequence? To this end, change provides
perspective.

<a name="the-three-yi" />

### [三易: The Three Yi](#the-three-yi)

The I Ching went through three major period of reinterpretation,
according to the following lecture. Each period corresponds to a
different means of interpreting the I Ching: in terms of state, change
and essence.

- TODO: link lecture that this was obtained from. note that I can't
  find much info on this (even in chinese searches)
- TODO: correct

#### &#9312; State 簡易 jiǎnyì かんい 간이

#### &#9313; Change: 變易 biànyì へんい 변이

#### &#9314; Essence: 不易 bùyì ふい 부이

> The above phonetic translations into Korean and Japanese may need
> correction comes from

Within the three yi lays the definition of the differential operator;
in simpler terms: the derivative. This much is made plain, yet
furthermore, given some familiarity with linear operators, you may
find that between the preservation of state and change, the
differential operator hides the essence of linear systems: the fourier
operator is also linear.

`d(F(x)) = F(d(x))` -- this equality *must* hold for linear equations;
this is essentially the definition of the differential operator, a
linear operator.

But *also* `d(FFT(F(x))) = FFT(d(F(x)))`!!!

Even if you don't immediately comprehend this, it is well worth the
thought to consider how magical these simple statements are! They
describe *profound* preservation of equilibrium, where the *essence*
is found in all the relationships between `d(.)`, `F(x)`, `FFT(.)` and
most critically `=`.

Thence, I posit that the Three Yi's philosophies of state, change and
essence encode not simply the differential operator, but also it's
linear interchange with that of the fourier operator. All linear
systems must also be considered spectrally, but in doing so, one finds
that any spectral valuation of linear equations must also preserve
connections to the differential spectral valuations. Mathematically,
this is a symbolically derived definition of essence.

#### The [Spectral] Convolution Theorum:

![The Spectral Convolution Theorum](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/spectral-convolution-theorum.jpg)

If state, change and [spectral] essence are three classes of analysis
methods for studying a system's mechanics and dynamics, then a
suitable next step is the [convolution
theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem), which
extracts resolution from systems by recursively evaluating their
discrete spectralization. The process of convolution, applied to
spectral data of increasing resolution, does not stand alone as its
own class, but should be considered a tool within the Yi realm of
essence.

### [What Is Knowledge of Dependent Origination Without Applied Awareness of Phenomena?](#what-is-knowledge-of-dependent-origination-without-applied-awareness-of-phenomena)

By studying the I Ching, one arrives at tools and methods to
analytically assess phenomena. Because such methods are fundamentally
analytically, the insights and extrapolations derived thereof do not
necessarily depend on the inner workings of the phenomena, their
mechanics and interacting dynamics. Instead these analytic tools allow
for introspection of phenomena in a manner completely disconnected
from their mechanics. Understanding this is equivalent to
understanding *why* simple machine learning algorithms work in the way
they do, usually without requiring any knowledge of the systems they
analyze and predict. An algorithm to classify handwritten digits does
not necessarily require any knowledge of handwritten digits.

Phenomenologically, to what does [dependent
origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratītyasamutpāda) depend
upon? As a chemical oracle once *experienced* unto me at the climax of
a Lotus show, dependent origination is dependent upon itself; all
other phenomena can trace their origination to dependent origination.

#### The Twelve Nidanas of Pratītyasamutpāda, Dependent Origination

![The Twelve Nidanas of Pratītyasamutpāda](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/twelve-nidanas.jpg)

To what do we owe comprehension of the true essence of things? To
state and to change, which both together reveal the true essence of
phenomena. Without one, the other is meaningless; without both, we can
never know the true essence of things. The true constancy of
phenomenona can only be revealed to us in the ways dynamics are bound
to laws of natural philosophy.

# [The Analytic I Ching](#the-analytic-i-ching)

The I Ching resounds along with the most beautiful philosophical ideas
my mind has considered. It's the combinatorial exploration of
noo-space, presenting my mind with random permutations of narrative
metatypes, parameterized by random images. Each hexagram's lines can
be reinterpreted analytically, in terms of physics and math metaphors,
to eloquent explain what the wisest among humanity has always known
known in terms the rationalists of modernity can only know with
confidence in our era.

<a name="sociophysical-phenomena-in-a-bronze-age-encyclopedia-of-natural-philosophy" />

### [Sociophysical Phenomena in a Bronze Age Encyclopedia of Natural Philosophy](#sociophysical-phenomena-in-a-bronze-age-encyclopedia-of-natural-philosophy)

The I Ching is a Bronze Age compendium of *social physics* in terms of
natural philosophy. Through this lens, one can see what I call the
Analytic I Ching: each hexagram captures a method of analyzing a
situation. Such methods can be symbolized and logically proven with
rigor acceptable to rationalists, yes. This is what western thought
has given us with logic, science and math. But further, these same
concepts can be felt via exploration of purely natural phenomena.

<a name="why-couldnt-vector-calculus-be-more-relatable" />

### [Why Couldn't Vector Calculus Be More Relatable?](#why-couldnt-vector-calculus-be-more-relatable)

What are the operators of vector calculus? The Gradient? The
Laplacian? They are morphemes in the universal language of math... But
how universal is that language, *truly?* Are these merely applicable
to science, math and physics? No doubt, these operators and other
mathematic phonemes are invaluable tools for expansion of the mind's
abilities: to coordinate; to plan; to predict; to define. But can they
be explained to a five year-old?

Einstein *mathematically* proved the existence of the atom after
eureka revealed proof unto him upon observing the brownian motion of
sugar dissolving into his cup of coffee. What was so special about
that cup of coffee?

> What is the Laplacian? It is the *magnitude of change* over space,
> across time, where the change is the gradient -- or the derivative,
> essentially. See? That's not so bad.

Why couldn't your grandmother understand the Laplacian? Can an average
physicist -- whose mind entertains the possibilities of [Helmholtz's
theorums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz%27s_theorems) as
applied to equilibria of vortices and higher-order surfaces in an
ideal fluid -- ever understand how the very same theorums are applied
to social physics? Of course, but to what degree?  This is the beauty
of an analytic interpretation of the I Ching: metaphors of purely
natural philosophy can allow both a wise, but uneducated grandmother
and an average physicist to communicate powerful explanations of
social dynamics using a language of purely natural phenomena.

The beauty of vector calculus operators is in how they pervade the
world around us, despite being swept into abyssal enigmas of college
textbooks, ancient wisdom traditions and the occult. You can see
vector calculus when you steep tea or when you make tye dye
t-shirts. Every cook in the kitchen, if they're worth their salt, must
develop some intuition of the gradient and laplacian. They just don't
realize the depth of knowledge that analytic neurological systems in
their human brain enable within their mind. Its simply a matter of
perception and cognition to unlock within the mind what already exists
in the brain. A chef has to work with particularly complicated
chemical changes and, to do so, must visually *read* changing color
gradient that identify visible phase changes marking the progression
of a chemical reaction. From the level of neurological circuits to
pathways, these analytic systems can be reverse engineered by the mind
to enable streamlined cognition in the same way one accelerates
graphics processing with a GPU.

Natural philosophy enables the mind to curry metaphors from nature
into our cognitive processes, so that we can reason about state,
change and essence -- even in social systems where such dynamics do
not manifest visibly. Math merely makes certain the epistemic
structures corresponding to knowledge relevated to us by
nature.

Understand this and suddenly the ancient world's forgotten traditions
of knowledge awaken again. Humans have always dealt with the same
experience of reality and we have always possessed approximately the
same level of intelligence. The only factor distinguishing the modern
era is that we stand on the shoulders of giants, whose rationalist
traditions pass down knowledge through literature that cannot fade
from the world so easily. Still, the ancient world holds more
knowledge that remains lost so long as our arrogant perception of
superiority persists.

### [Art: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly](#art-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly)

The below photoshopped picture's egregrious violations of the
preservation of quantities in vorticies insults the memory of
Helmholtz. In more simple terms: the photo *looks* fake, but how can
one intuitively describe *how* it is definitively fake without
inspecting the pixels for evidence of photoshopping? It's because it
defies the human intuition for natural philosophy.

#### Helmholtz's Three Laws Are Demonstrated By Every Vape Video On Youtube

![Smoke Rings](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/smoke-rings.jpg)

We do not need advanced symbolic manipulation of maths and logic to
understand that this photo is fake. A visual representation of
phenomena, whether artistic or photographic, in its depiction of
natural phenomena, must reflect the preservation of equilibrium.
Otherwise it *looks* fake. This is the difference between bad lighting
and good lighting in paintings. When visual phenomena deviate from our
neurologically encoded physical models, our analytical emulation of
physics can not only distinguish the qualitative differences at a
subconscious level, but also direct the mind's attention to areas in
the depiction's local space that seem *most fake*.

Via our experience of physical phenomena via sensory stimuli, our
brain develops analytical models of physics that effectively
approximate the laws of physics. This provides our minds with
intuition for physical systems. Even though our minds have no
numerical/algebriac encoding of the laws of physics, it is conditioned
early on to be capable of analytically emulating the laws. By engaging
in physically strenuous activities -- e.g. [martial arts with weapons
or
skateboarding](/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html)
-- our minds can be trained to more effectively internalize these
physical models.

![The Great Wave, a Japanese Woodblock Print](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/the-great-wave.jpg)

The progenitors and authors of I Ching *assumed* that sociophysical
mechanics and dynamics mimicked those found in the natural world. This
coupling that bounds social phenomena to reflect physical phenomena is
how the child, whose mind has been attuned to the accurate perception
of natural and social phenomena, can see that the emporer of Hans
Christian Andersen's wears no clothes: the near-equilibrium of social
physics is starkly violated. As a work of natural philosophy, the I
Ching informed ancient China of social physics by generating random
images of metaphor to natural phenomena.

#### A Spherical Arrangement of the I Ching's Hexagrams

> Notice the arrangement of **hexagrams: 1, 2, 11, 12, 63 and 64**. These

![I Ching Sphere](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/ichingsphere.jpg)

#### &#9775; Hexagrams 1 & 2: at the poles

#### &#9775; Hexagrams 63 & 64: at the very center

#### &#9775; Hexagrams 11 & 12: to the left and right of center

Their symmetrical placement in this sphere is reflected in the Yin and
Yang lines constituting each hexagram. These six hexagrams exhibit the
clearest, most simply defined symmetry, making them a microcosm of the
I Ching.

<a name="the-yin-yang-microcosm-pervading-i-ching" />

# [The Yin-Yang Microcosm Pervading I Ching](#the-yin-yan-microcosm-pervading-i-ching)

I woke up from a dream and, as is often the case, the first five
minutes were filled with blissful insights the clarity of which
subside for the remainder of the day. Dreams are the only time I am
free, I think, but it won't be long until technology comes to take
away our dreams as well. Nihilism... what will we do when it becomes
as broad as daylight: there is nothing a man can dream to save us from
the final human condition. And why would we take this from ourselves?

As it does after the most vivid dreams, the nerves in my nose were
tingling electrically for those five minutes. These dreams usually
involve transportation at some point. I've only ever experienced this
in the past few years of my life. Here I have the most clear thoughts,
though not necessarily connected to my dreams, and it is here where I
feel like I know my mind, as it is truly meant to be. Perhaps it is
artificially constrained and maybe it's natural.[^metacognition]

The sudden insight: the social and phenomenological dynamics
symbolized following hexagrams can all be summed up by analogies to
waves on a beach. Describing six fundamental hexagrams within a
pattern language of waves yields an *au naturale* basis for dialectic.

#### Phenomenology of Ocean Waves

![The lifecycle of waves](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/waves-lifecycle.jpg)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 1: [The Creative](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/1.php)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 2: [The Receptive](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/2.php)

Hexagram 1 corresponds to the action of kinetic energy on the system
that creates the forms we recognize as waves. Hexagram 2 represents
the action of the beach & seafloor shaping the dispersion of kinetic
energy. The shaping influence that the seafloor exerts corresponds to
the female aspect of the phenomenology here. The influence that the
forces and momentums exert on the water as a fluid-dynamical system
correspond to the male aspects.

#### Ripcurrents

![Ripcurrents](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/waves-ripcurrents.jpg)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 11: [Peace](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/11.php)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 12: [Standstill (Stagnation)](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/12.php)

Hexagram 11 can be conceptualized by imagining rhythms of waves that
reinforce constructive interference. At the intersection of adjacent
waves, their energy becomes constructive and they push farther up the
shoreline, noisily frothing to their maximal extent. This is a
situation where there is minimal impact of unseen undertow, which
deconstructs the kinetic energy of waves into turbulence.

One may conceptualize Hexagram 12 as the deconstructive effect the
turbulence of undertow has on incoming waves.
[Stagnation](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/12.php) creates a
situation were waves tend to deconstruct each other. (On the time
scale of less than a dozen waves, protracted Stagnation creates an
opportunity for the next big wave to blow past the stagnant
water). The existing order is to be annihilated by the next large
burst of energy, whether from the interior or exterior. In
sociopolitcal terms, this is signified by a group of social
institutions that have unwisely waste their energy. Perhaps this is
fate and perhaps it is mismanagement. Regardless, it forebodes a
precarious situation, where change is soon to wash over.

#### Stagnation in Ocean Waves

> sand from the ocean floor.

![Waves Stagnation](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/waves-stagnation.jpg)

The hexagrams 1, 2, 11 and 12 form a microcosm within the I Ching by
mirroring the four images of [四象 (Sì Xiàng)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Symbols)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 63: [After Completion](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/63.php)

#### &#9775; Hexagram 64: [Before Completion](https://ichingfortune.com/hexagrams/64.php)

Regardless of how strongly resonant normative forces seem to secure
the certainty of an era or empire's social order, that group's social
order will break like the crest of a wave to reach its furthest extent
on the shore. This is the crux highlighted by the infinitessimal
difference between the hexagrams Before Completion (64) and After
Completion (63). The energies in flux that reinforce one social
hierarchy's sociopolitical norms are essentially generated by socially
distributed beliefs. As the socioeconomic situation changes
incentization of entities projecting agency through a system, socially
distributed belief changes to suit the needs of individuals and
groups. Network effects intrinsic to sociophysical networks create
tail risks. The socioepistemological churn between idealism and
materialism is a socially distributed process of genetic
epistemology. To be demonstrated later, the methods of marxist and
hegelian dialectic are tools for individuals and groups to influence
the mechanics and dynamics of this genetic socioepistemological
process.

The difference between the moment before and after some phenomenon's
maximal extent is infinitessimal. This is the task left to the fox
crossing the ice in hexagrams 63 & 64. When the energies reinforcing
systems of norms are resonant, this ice representing the forms of the
existing order may reinforce itself. To benefit from the apparent
certainty of the existing order is expedient; to exude confidence in
the overgrown shadow of creeping tail risk is foolish. That said, no
one actually respects an obsequious sycophant. As useful as they may
be, if their values are baseless, their lack of ethical fortitude will
eventually render moot any potential gain their servile calculations
may appear to offer.

  - the receptive: for the waves rolling in, the receptive are the
    forces (of the shore) acting on each to deconstruct their form and
    to eventually pull them back out to sea.

Hexagrams 1, 2, 11, and 12 are located in the four corners of
the grid.

<a name="rationalize-your-exegesis" />

# [Rationalize Your Exegesis](#rationalize-your-exegesis)

The exegesis herein is motivated by a visual reconstruction of
inductive combinations of potential narratives implied by
semiotics. The exegesis -- the motivation and modus operandi of
interpretation -- further reduces the induced possibilities by
constraining interpretation with Wilhelm's interpretation of the text,
in most areas. There are some lines where I feel that Wilhelm skipped
over the proper interpretation, but as of yet, I am not operating with
his same level of comprehension of Chinese culture.

<a name="timeless-writing-assumes-all-possible-integrpretations" />

### [Timeless Writing Assumes All Possible Interpretations](#timeless-writing-assumes-all-possible-interpretations)

When writing for an audience thousands of years in the future, meaning
is most effectively preserved by encoding it semiotically into images,
whose relevance and persistence is intended to be re-emulated in the
future, not by the ephemeral meaning of words, but by the implicit
relevance of the images those words inspire in the reader. It is only
after meditating on a Hexagram for a day or so that I feel that I
arrive at the proper intent. When interpreting such monumental works
of religion -- or when writing your own great work of literature -- it
is critical to understand the motivation behind transcending
limitations of language in this way.

<a name="the-i-ching-stands-alone" />

### [The I Ching Stands Alone!](#the-i-ching-stands-alone)

Therefore, you don't write more, you write less! You don't assume
there can be a most proper interpretation, you assume the work will be
constantly reinterpreted; instead you encode the form of the message
into a document such that most future reinterpretations can decode and
reconstruct such authenticity of message without relying on external
sources of information.  You don't rely on transient phenomena; the
degree of ephemerality of artificial phenomena signfies the likelihood
a proper interpretation will perish. All one must do to understand
timelessness is to read Nassim Taleb's article [The future will not be
cool](https://www.salon.com/2012/12/01/nassim_nicholas_taleb_the_future_will_not_be_cool/)
and one will realize: to captivate meaning and to capture
timelessness, one relies on timeless symbols:

> The food will be prepared using a very archaic technology (fire),
> with the aid of kitchen tools and implements that have not changed
> since the Romans (except in the quality of some of the metals

> New York (multinationals) today.

The most effective writing assumes all interpretations are valid and,
line by line, nails constraints onto the space of interpretations,
constricting the flexibility of interpretation. This is a
combinatorial search method that scores on informational coherence,
but also has "look ahead & collapse backwards" used by Bell's Theorum
-- i.e. assume all possibilities, use deduction wherever possible (it
is efficient), use combinatorial induction to scan forwards, then use
deduction to collapse backwards. By limiting the set of symbols and
morphemes employed, this guarantees that the proper interpretation
will be reinforced by the apparent spectral harmony of a subset of
semantic interpretations made manifest to the well-attuned reader. In
the informational context, spectral harmony defines "informational
coherence". However, I believe that *there is still absolute truth* --
which is an all encompassing ontological lattice into which all
information can fit.

I realize that Chinese authors of the I Ching -- and indeed the
authors of whatever body of divinatory work preceeded the I Ching --
did not have the modern era's profiency with symbolic manipulation of
math and physics. However, I truly believe they found much the same
form and order in nature to be rediscovered by the West's
proto-Rationalists in the Renaissance. It is math by intuition. Also,
the mind is an analytical computer and, if the most efficient way for
the mind to make physical predictions is by converging its own
analytical models to their numerical complements, then why can't the
mind bridge the gap from analytical to numerical simply by sseking the
most efficient solutions?

How is this possible? How much more efficiently can the mind operate
when its analytical models of physics approach near consensus with
symbolic/numerical physical laws? And, furthermore, can it then apply
such physical emulation monadically in concert with other
functionality in the mind?  Wouldn't this be far more efficient than
anything the conscious mind could produce?

With the Analytic I Ching, there are two objectives whose (solution) I
hope to intertwine. First, I wish to reinterpret the I Ching in the
image of moreso modern analytic tools. Second, I hope this results in
divination readings that are profound convolutions of these analytic
tools, providing value to both the average person looking for a more
rigorous set of abstractions by which to examine their query to the
Iching *and* as a comprehensive set of analytic tools useful data
scientists.

I hope to proceed towards this second objective in the same spirit as
the thesis of Hill's piece [Masters of Reality: The Trances and

the altered consciousness of trance-states allow the shaman to extract
an immense amount of utility by leveraging intuition of the mind and
of phenomena in tandem with exploratory divination.

Here are three or four books I'd love to publish:

Still, even now, no one takes me seriously. And I mean [almost] *no
person on the planet* takes me seriously. People are simple -- they
recognize labels and that is mostly all. They do not know the
substance attached to labels, if they can even expound on the label's
meaning. They excel at vocabulary tests, dominate multiple choice, but
suffer from a prefrontal defect where applied critical thinking is not
available to them. Knowing they cannot, would they even dare to try?
With the thought police over their shoulder? When the educated
populace want to ascertain the extent and novelty of someone's
internalized epistemic structures, they are capable of limited
reasoning, given a short list of that person's academic degrees, each
degree corresponding to a lower epistemic bound of domain
knowledge. This, in itself is valuable, but insufficient for true
evolution.

This leaves me with *nothing* and certainly without the respect I
deserve. Perhaps I don't deserve much. I'm not asking for much, but
`-$0.61` in the bank is ludicrous.

### [The Trance State: A Visual Emulation Whereby One Viscerally Experiences The Metaphysical](#the-trance-state-a-visual-emulation-whereby-one-viserally-experiences-the-metaphysical)

The experience of the spiritual is the apprehension of eternal,
unchanging metaphysical forms as they manifest themselves in the
material plane. To me, these are like Kant's noumena that can't be
known to exist nor to not exist. They emanate into the material world
and are the underlying monadic patterns which frame dynamics of
informational phenomena. To apprehend the true nature of these
metaphysical forms as they appear to influence causal flow of events
is to be in tune with the spiritual. If various methods of shamanism
can repeatedly evoke visceral experiences to bring you closer to
understanding of these forms as they influence the world around
you, then there is no need for a supernatural connection. Instead, the
spiritual experience can be explained as purely the mind's experience
of purely informational mechanics within itself -- which can include
the experience of information that, while the mind's analytic systems
are never capable of fully ingesting, still result in transformative
structural changes to the psyche. These purely informational mechanics
are mapped to the aforementioned noumena-like forms, which are not
only eternally unchanging, but universal throughout space and
time. while they are composed of ineffable "monadic substances", the
same eternal forms can be tapped into by *any consciousness* and *any
information-processing entity*, without any need for supernatural
mechanics -- whether or not those exist is perhaps another
question. this is essentially no different than the Tao or
Leibniz's Monad. to me, the shaman's trance and spiritual experiences
are visceral experiences in the minds of those who are intimately in
tune with the nature of the eternal. it is projected to the mind as a
visceral experience where archetypes of the eternal are witnessed by
the shaman, who must then make sense of what was seen.

### [The Shaman's Method is Experiential Divination By Reverse Engineering The Mind's Analytic Systems](#the-shamans-method-is-experiential-divination-by-reverse-engineering-the-minds-analytic-systems)

So, shamanism's altered states of consciousness are essentially a
vehicle for experiential divination, where the mind experiences the
combinated elements of narrative parameterized by archetypal images. I
Ching is divination by bibliomancy, where images from natural
philosophy provide random points of reference that the I Ching
personified posits as explanation for the situation described by the
*querent*. If one simply substitutes these images from natural
philosophy with the interpreted analytic tools I believe the hexagrams
represent, then one arrives at a more modern revision of the
divinatory vehicle that I believe the I Ching was intended to be.

If one's perception of a situation is imagined as a point in an
analytic hyperplane, and the I Ching's explanation of a query is
imagined as another point in along that hyperplane, then the true
value of divination is found by evaluating all the possible paths that
connect those two points.

TODO: See [below](#below) for a better explanation of (...) In my
opinion, there is little value in accepting the random point the I
Ching yields to the querent as a definitively true message. It is
instead the dissonance between the querent's perception of their
situation and the I Ching's projection perception of the same
situtation: these are the two points and their dissonance is evaluated
by constructing paths to explain the difference between them. Since
the points returned by the I Ching or some other divinatory system are
effectively random, then they are completely disconnected from all the
inherent biases that humans have. This deshrouds a person from their
biases and thereby divination may disrupt the hold that the
unconscious or illusion have over a person.

### [Your Task: Complete The Circumstantial Circuit(s) Of Explanation](#your-task-complete-the-circumstantial-circuits-of-explanation)

In this way, the I Ching is tooling for toying with the
hyper-parameters of the mind's neural network learning systems; it
presents the mind with an unconsciously arranged smattering of images
and archtypes. Hereby, the I Ching provides random fodder to expand
with combinatorially inductive reasoning, to be reduced by abductive
and deductive methods. If such fodder corresponds to a truly universal
mapping of the phenomena and the dynamics of human experience, then
there is no social force that can captivate my awareness by persisting
my unconsciousness to various phenomena, whereby the I Ching is my
divinatory escape from a socially imposed prison of unconsciousness!

This requires a universal covering, which is why the statistical
mechanics of the I Ching is paramount. It's yarrow sticks method for
sampling a true uniform distribution of random numbers. If this
corresponds to a truly uniform covering of phenomena and dynamics,
then it truly acts as a set of keys to unlock any and every potential
circumstance of social captivity.

### [Hexagram 5 Delineates a Taxonomy of Local Minima, Not Simply "Waiting"](#hexagram-5-dilineates-a-taxonomy-of-local-minima-not-simply-waiting)

Each line in the fifth hexagram covers a different species of local
minima in optimization problems. Waiting is what happens when humans
who experience sociophysical local minima are forced to deal with an
externally imposed lack of progress. The kinds of situations where
there one perceives some "lack of progress" can be destructured into a
mathematic model, where the same kind of analytic hyperplane of
solution-space used in machine learning algorithms forms the basis of
a space. One's motion in the social situation can be plotted as a path
in this analytic hyperplane.

- TODO: assemble!

![Pictures of notes from Hexagram 5]()

There is a taxonomy of local minima that describes ALL of the species
of minima that can be encountered: the first five lines of Hexagram 5
enumerates ALL of these minima types. The Theorema Egregum... There is
the meadow, a flat space, which is a symbol that recurs again and
again in the I Ching. This is a space of comfort; nothing is to be
challenged, but "crossing the great water" requires moving oneself out
of a comfort zone, where perhaps one encounters more disadvantaged
situations. There is the pit in the fourth line, a relatively global
minima. There is the place of "meat and drink" in the fifth line,
which describes a higher local minima encountered after climbing out
of the Pit. Finally, in the sixth line, how does one escape all of
these traps? It is by encountering three guests who are traversing the
same space: this is analogous to parallelized methods for accelerating
training of machine-learning algorithms. These three guests have
explored the contours of the adjacent hyperplane: the bring to you
information about how to escape your local minima.

the Boltzmann Machine's profoundly generalized conception of
energy. Understanding the concept of Physical Energy, generalized to
abstract scenarios, is something that would benefit every Western
Rationalist to understand. In machine learning, there are
generalizable methods for convex/concave optimization wherein many
process explore a space in parallel. In a Boltzman Machine, each
process has its own theta-weights and, as iterations of the algorithm
runs, then subsequent iterations allocate more effort to regions of
the space with more concavities. Many of the same approaches involving
energy and entropy that Boltzmann introduced to model thermodynamics
are applied to higher-order energy types. For my own purposes in
distinguishing this from physical energy: these I have named energies,
plural. The concept of "Energies" is employed repeatedly in biophysics
and social physics. Any and every quantity that is statistically
distributed over a space can be conceptualized as a higher-order
energy, which can be braided together with the concept of Dirichlet
energy.

Why was Boltzmann tormented to suicide? It's all for revelating to the

millennia. If you understand how this revolutionized the steel and

The hexagram that warns against such intellectual stagnation is
**Hexagram 12**. This is a scenario of Stagnation profits the weak who
somehow cling to power, which is why the wise must unseat them by
**tying seeds to the shoots of a mulberry bush**, in gambits often
involving sacrifice and a transgenerational passing of the
baton. Those at the top of the pyramid will ruthless torment a family
for generations if they lead to significant problems
... apparently. To affect significant change and get away with it
requires being well protected, being smart enough to hide the intent
to create change and/or being made the seeds tied to the shoots of the
mulberry bush, which is very difficult to destroy.

If you act in this way, you do not necessarily *destroy* to guarantee
success, but you plan to succeed in all situations. Even in the face
of systemic failure, such an occurance would only result in an
imbalance that allows you to grow faster. In this way, there is no
need to worry about failure. The turbulence of systemic collapse is a
net benefit to no one, which is also what nearly guarantees that a
system will continue. For example, when Wall Street faces systemic
collapse, it only lights a fire under the ass of the most wealthy
people in the world -- they all collectively work to save the system
that benefits them so much.

To me, the mulberry bush also symbolizes an epistemological revolution
-- a revolution in the epistemic shape of knowledge. When you are
standing on the shoulders of giants, you always structure new
knowledge in terms of the old. Sometimes this can prevent a culture's
systems of knowledge from progressing any further, in a significant
way. This is stagnation all the same. To overcome it, one needs to
reach the same heights -- without standing on the shoulders of
giants. It is theoretically possible for some intellectual body of
knowledge to seem consistent, but have epistemic flaws. If everyone's
drinking from the same well, so to speak, then their intellectual
pursuits will all extrapolate similarly. If someone approaches the
same problems naïvely, it requires a hundred times the effort and
natural talent, but they can recalclitrate the problems near the base
of the epistemic mulberry bush. When the bush groups back, it will
have a stronger base, but sociologicially fixing the structure of
shared knowledge is also expensive.

You can thank Aristotle and the Greeks for creating such a system to
counter the East: when physical travel limited the spread of
information, the West was always at an geoinformational
disadvantage. Further, that the most significant economically
strategic chokepoints along the Silk Road were dominated by the East
implies that until the past millinium, the West constantly bled
liquidity to middlemen in the Near East, who stood to benefit from all
trade between the East and West. From the churn of empires contending
to displace one another in the Near East emerged the need to control
*sociophilosophical churn*. Despite every empire's tendency to project
an illusion of unquestionable eternity, every architect of empire
knows it is a pyramid scheme of power. Controlling the potential for
systems of thought to normalize back and forth between material and
immaterial conceptions of metaphysics conferred advantages: for those
empires whose regional power was secured in foreseeable generations
needed to secure the potential to regain power in future generations;
likewise, those regions dominated by the empire of their times needed
popular adoption of systems of thought to counter the existing powers.

This idea that philosophical traditions in the West and Near East
would churn between being immaterially and materially oriented based
on the economic needs and trends of the powerful and the powerless
resonates with the Conflict Theory of Karl Marx. In times when the
existing systems of thought economically benefit the masses, then the
people are content with systems leaning towards immaterial metaphysics
-- yet between generations, each region's economic imperitives
ordained specific benefits to systems of thought, which above all else
needed to be adaptable. This perhaps explains the rift between Plato
and Aristotle's thought on metaphysics: Aristotle's generation had
found the truth impractical, given the West's economic dependence on
trade in the east.

The contention between the Marxist and Hegelian conceptions of both
metaphysics and dialectical argumentation can also be explained as
tools to reinforce or disrupt existing orders. The marxist dialectic's
utility, in the context of sociopolitical reform, is in challenging
and overturning an existing order or establishing a new one
entirely. It provides a vexingly systematic means of influencing
discourse and rhetoric by rooting argumentation in a limited set of
terms and dissuading "constructing". The Hegelian dialectic, in its
social application, advantages the existing sociopolitical order,
whether it is dominant or occult. However, this begs the question: how
do Marxist political orders whose systems of thought become well
established insulate themselves from disruption without eventually
diluting their dialectic?

Control how people conceive reality, *control the limits of how people
conceive reality* **and you control the collective dreams of
humanity.** Into which far-flung recesses of the collective
epistemological possibility space might thinkers great and small
direct their attention? Socially distributed systems of thought
determine what can be considered "normal" to be within the Kantian
Category for some individual in society -- which is itself a kind of
[dual space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space) of reasonable
thought or expectation about some given social phenomena or
dynamic. Control, constrain or spectrally filter this dual space of
the Kantian Category of reasonably expected extrapolations in social
mechanics/dynamics and you control the collective dreams of your
people.

This is the power of trapping entire cultures in a false paradigms;
this is the danger of pure materialism. It is terrifying because it
means that humanity's power to dream collectively might be
extinguished. Not a single person would be standing to pierce through
the invisible darkness of ignorance that blankets us. Where the
idealist conception of metaphysics is typically rooted in some set of
perfect archetypes or froms, the materialist's conception is ideally
rooted in a universally distributed shared epistemology of empirically
observable facts. Hence, to the materialist, the region of epistemic
possibility space that seems reasonable is far more constrained. This
is pragmatic for material progress, but it bounds the potential for
socioepistemic churn and thus limits the rate of evolution.

Similar to the socioeconomic churn from which billionaires extract
slices of financial wealth and similar to a battery's potential
difference that creates voltage, there is power to be gained in the
social movement from one paradigm to another. This process plays out
between groups vying for power over man's shadow and his self-imposed
limitations on thought. With respect to a philosophical context, when
thought is consolidated into more singular paradigms, the potential
for humanity's evolution stagnates.

Psychology also exhibits social churn in society's acceptance of
distributed paradigms. Jungian ideas are notoriously difficult to
frame in an experiment. Thus, they are often conspicuously absent from
psychological practice, though it's arguable that some Jungian ideas
exhibit more power and allow more control if they influence you
*unconsciously*. Hence, encourage the acceptance of a false or
unprovable paradigm and you empower *some* of Jung's ideas. Every
person undergoes a gradual, lifelong process of waking up. Though
initially tabula rasa, their individual unconscious, is etched away by
their experience...

Some of Jung's ideas are derided because they cannot be proven.  This
is similar to what is perhaps greatest riddle of Navier Stokes: what
if something is true, but simply unprovable?  What if something exists
beyond time and space, whose truth can never be made certain in the
material world? Does science fail?  What if Navier Stokes is a
neverending riddle is freakishly similar to Kant's
noumenon. Regardless to the answer in Navier Stokes, here it's
presented merely as food for thought -- but would this imply Gödel to
be any less provable?

results from the near-infinite nature of the mind. Studying the mind
and assuming you can clamp down controls one a handful of variables is
foolish. The mind differs fundamentally from other subjects of
experimental methodology by the same phenomenological measures whereby
finite-dimensional systems are distinguished from infinite-dimensional
systems. Psychology stands to benefit by understanding the approaches
used in bayesian non-parametrics and infinite dimensional
systems. Simply controlling a handful of variables is not enough to
guaranteed consistency or reproducibility. You must approach the brain
and mind as a holistic system -- i.e. from both the top down and
bottom up.

potential statistical mechanical distributions, delineating upon some
parameters. Sociophysical ensembles yield distributions of social
particles and social dyanmics that are not the composition of
dilineated physical attributes, but instead are ensembles whose
distributions are arranged along ontological space in terms of each
distribution's ontological metatypes.

The idea of an ensemble from thermodynamics helps describe how the
mind provides a "sense" of intuition to the conscious from the
lower-levels of the subconscious. the mind is trying to piece apart
its analysis of experience in typological and ontological terms:
i.e. it is analytically delineating its experience to try to describe
how frequently variables/features of its experience occur; both when
those variables/features occur in isolation or in combination. **This
is an analytical definition of intuition that the mind develops in the
lower levels of the subconscious. it then exposes this to the
conscious mind as a "feeling".** *Something else is there, you haven't
found it yet, but you can **feel** it...* If you can consciously
understand how this process is driven by a typological dilineation of
a sociophysical ensemble, then you can use this as a higher-level
construction of intuition. Thus, it's an emulation of the lower-level
subconscious intuition -- separate from instinctual intuition, but
also *driving your instinctual intuition.* Your cognition is sharpend
by the total intuition it has to gravitate towards uncertainty and
away from the "shadows" of unknown unknowns that it senses.

> Again, you've been warned. Seek consistency of information.
>
> **Assumptions should break quickly. Belief should form slowly!**

The idea of an ensemble intersects with Jung's Synchronicity in
fascinating ways! If you can connect synchronicity with the idea of an
ensemble, it will augment your understanding and application of Jung's
ideas. It's a difficult concept to explain because it requires
understanding Statistical Mechanics. For any particle system, like a
mixture of gasses in an internal combustion engine, there are
"natural" samplings that determine valid distributions of particle
positions/momentums to sample from. In statistical mechanics, you
discard invalid samplings. Instead they are undefined and thus they
don't contribute to the shape of a valid distribution. Yet, these
distributions vary only many variables. For a gas, pressure,
temperature, the size of a container, variance in pressure or variance
in temperature: all of these are variables that could theoretically be
relevant to the ensemble, which allows you to control variation in
those variables and generate a valid classical-mechanical
distribution, a priori.

#### Imagine Randomly Generated Distributions of Disks

![Hard Disk System](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/hard-disk-system.jpg)

If you can then describe how the statistical mechanical aspects of
those particle systems are aligned along various variables -- width of
chamber in an internal combustion engine or how the composition of
oxygen, gasoline and nitrogen impact the dynamics of the gases -- then
this is an ensemble. It allows you to parameterize the statistical
mechanical distributions used in thermodynamics along some variables
and sample from distributions whose variables you can change.

**Why is this relevant for psychology and sociology?** Even though the
spatial complexity is profoundly more convoluted than with
thermodynamics, your brain is constantly tallying experience types &
metatypes that inform it of life's valid distributions -- for which it
is trying to typologically correlate to variables. This impacts the
effect that accumulation of information and the precipitation of new
belief has on the conscious formation of memories of events, as they
happen. Later in life you may reevaluate the same memories with new
information and extract useful information, but you can't form those
beliefs moving forward unless you have the information to consciously
include them in your frame and perspective. If you form memories with
a clear perspective moving forward, those memories are more likely to
be consistent, but critically you still have the chance to affect what
happens: thus this understanding impacts the direction you will take
to seek relevant information.

The brain/mind engages in this process of tallying experience and
reflecting on its understanding of sociophysical ensembles to
understand how one's actions correspond to cause/effect. If your mind
is polluted with misinformation and disinformation, this results in
invalid conceptions being retained in memory. Yet, the brain
neurologically seeks *consistency* in information. In doing so, it's
generating the ensemble for intuition, so that it can understand when
either variables or features of sampled distributions of experience
(either real or simulated) are strongly biased in an unnatural way,
which implies the need to seek more information. Conscious thoughts
and the sub/conscious interface impact how the brain stores
information and forms beliefs from the top down -- in addition to the
are bottom up effects resulting in a sense of intuition.

- TODO: this process of classifying, organizating and arranging
  experiences, which develops one's intuition ... is similar to the
  process by which personal norms and perceived social norms form.
  - when someone's experience is skewed typologically in some extreme
    ways, then their intuition and apprehension of norms may become
    dysfunctional. this tends to create abnormal psychology and can be
    provoked intentionally, but almost certainly requires social
    isolation.

Your sense of intuition operates at a low-level of the subconscious.
It is exposed to the conscious mind as a sense, but each individual's
clarity and accuracy depend strongly on that person's life experience,
but also that person's constructed perception of their life
experience.

The mind-blowing realization is that, if your conscious mind
understands how the sociophysical ensemble corresponds to intuition
and, if you are skilled resolving synchronicity, then you can develop
the skill of consciously emulating intuition. It's a metacognitive
skill with profound implications. Since it tells you the most valuable
places to look for relevant information, *it tells you everything you
need to know ... that you don't already know.*

When the sense or functionality of intuition is itself under a
person's control, it basically makes them a quasi-psychic. Still, it
requires proactive & reactive engagement. Otherwise, you can be duped
into delusional thinking by this "emulated" intuition, just as you can
be duped by your subconscious intuition. You have to form hypotheses
-- and then act on them. In my life, information flows one way: away
from me. It never flows to me. People short-circuit my access to
information while encouraging beliefs they know to be false. I'm not
sure if this is the **most unhealthy thing you can do** for "someone
you fear may be delusional" -- but it's probably pretty close.

Essentially, there are many ideas of Jüng that were unprovable by
existing experimental methodologies for which data science and
neurology will close in on and prove unquestionably. This should
happen within the next 10 years. Some of his ideas, may not have a
neuro-analytical basis -- but just because you can't prove it's true
doesn't mean it is not true.

Even if there's no rationale for connecting your detection of
synchronicity to some person's intention in your social environment,
reasoning about it helps you metacognitively reflect on your self. Why
did that event seem synchronous? Is it just me? Can I discern when
someone intends to provoke synchronicity? Why would they try so hard?
That last question is usually a good check on paranoid thinking -- how
would someone have access to information that informs them on how to
provoke synchronicity? You must be able to reason about social flows
of information to reason about this. In isolation and under
surveillance, the weaponization of synchronicity can drive someone
insane -- EASILY! This is how the mafia threatens you, by the
way. They use the idea of the Kantian Category along with provocation
of synchronicity to send the signal: BACK OFF! ... from what? If i
don't know, i can't heed your threat. It's meaningless.

There is a brilliant theorum of holes in space called
[Gauss-Bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss–Bonnet_theorem). Just
like Gauss's [Theorema
Egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium) correlates
restrictions on the space of functions to elicit guarantees of
curvature, the theorum of Gauss-Bonnet places elicits similar
constraints for how the Euler Characteristic must behave, given the
curvature of space or of surfaces. There is equilibrium in all
curvature: this is what the Theorema Egregia tells us. Wherever there
is an increase, if continuity constraints are to be maintained, there
must be corresponding decrease. However, in the study of algebraic
topology, Gauss-Bonnet is similar, but applies to the manisfestation
of holes in n-dimensional shapes. This theorum correlates changes in
Euler Characteristic to necessitate compensating chagnes in the
surface curvature to the need to average the values of Euler
Characteristic when considering the surfaces of manifolds,
differentially.

Maxima & minima along the hyperplane -- which is itself a higher-order
cost function of theta-weight configurations of the lower-order cost
function -- may yield regions that are inaccessible to any
configuration of theta-weights. The algorithm requires structural or
algebraic changes to produce improvements. These regions are, to the
hyperplane, what white-holes are to black holes. This is why there are
major topological connections to be found in optimizing the
hyperparameters for machine learning.

Even the volume of spacetime *is* a surface: a 3D surface in a 4D
volume. This is perhaps more correctly considered as [2,1]-D surfaces
in a [3,1]-D volume, three dimensions of space and one of time. This
is why Gauss-Bonnet is relevent to cosmology and astronomy: the
singularities of black holes are the "holes" in spacetime and
therefore, Gauss-Bonnet applies to astronomy. Considering the
energetic consequences of the topology of spacetime -- as the surfaces
of its manifold changes topologically when hole appears where none was
before -- is fascinating. Why?  *Because equilibrium is a very special
thing.* For continuity constraints to be placed upon physical systems,
the additional constraint of energetic equilibrium results in a far
more limited space for potential system configurations.

### [The Hows and Whys of the MAPPER Algorithm](#the-hows-and-whys-of-the-mapper-algorithm)

The hyperplane describes an analytic algorithm's solution space -- the
range of possibilities for theta weights concerning the efficiency of
the algorithm. As algorithm training and backpropagation inform
gradient descent -- whether using Newton's method, one based on the
Fisher metric or another optimization method -- it generates a path on
the hyperplane surface. Gradually, the velocity of this object
traveling in the hyperspace slows down as the algorithm approaches
diminishing returns. Brouwer's translation theorem may apply to some
advanced optimization approaches, but Gauss-Bonnet certainly applies
when there are complicated topological features. This latter method is
related to the MAPPER algorithm[^mapper-algorithm], which converts the
hyperplane into simplicial complices which discretize the hyperplane's
topological features, to further efficient approximations about where
returns are less diminishing. MAPPER also enables XAI (explainable
artificial intelligence), since hyperplane features are imprints of
form corresponding to the problem domain. This is why reasoning about
the topological features of the hyperplane corresponds to
metacognition.

#### Images from a paper on MAPPER[^mapper-algorithm]

![MAPPER algorithm 2](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/mapper-alg-2.jpg)

HELOC is a technique which builds on MAPPER, rendering the decisions
in automated loan processing explainable, for example. These
simplicial complices result in a kind of index for AI which can be
searched, more or less.[^heloc-xai] Computing this index requires less
computation for AI's analysis of human communications/signals than
vice versa...

No matter how one structures a computer vision algorithm, there are
image classes that trouble it. Since its score is always below 100%
accuracy, the configurations of theta-weights cluster around holes in
the hyperplane.  These may be whiteholes. Or, they may not be
singularities, but instead an insurmountable boundary to the
algorithm's hyperparameters. If the latter is true, the
hyperparameters must be tuned to cross into a region of the hyperplane
that corresponds to an inaccessible signed vector field or some
otherwise inaccessible region -- both are why Brouwer's is
relevant. It's like being stuck in a valley or canyon, never being
able to see what's beyond the horizon. Because you can't climb on the
ridges fast enough to get to the top to see, you never think to look
beyond. In 3-D? Easy. In n-D? The curse of dimensionality convolutes
the species of concavity and convexity which means there are lots of
pockets of space in the hyperplane to search -- none of which are
guaranteed to produce results.

Making inferences about Gauss-Bonnet allows the hyper-algorithm to
*analytically* reason about topological features in a manner
completely disconnected from the possible range of correspondent
domain features. By indirectly inferring their presence, the nature of
convexity beyond the ridgeline and whether the topological features
are singular, one overcome the barriers presented by hyperparameter
configuration. Hence, the Euler characteristic is relevant, and
Gauss-Bonnet tells you about how these "holes" are balanced and
distributed across the space, what their density is, how the
hyper-algorithm's conception of the hyperplane evolves, what the what
the implications are for hyperplane's curvature, etc. It's a metric
similar to the Laplacian or the Hausdorff dimension which changes over
the regions of the space considered.

The downside? This hyper-algorithmic process is expensive!
Topologically analyzing the hyperplane effectively involves a
cost-function of cost-function configurations. It is also a
particularly expensive application of metalearning, requiring perhaps
thousands of algorithm-trainings. In practice, applications require
analyzing the Hyperplane as it changes -- analyzing the changing
hyperplane diffeomorphically, in other words. When it changes,
*sometimes* previously held data, theta-paths and the assumptions
thereof must be thrown out.

### [Wherefore A Rough Diamond Lies Herein](#wherefore-a-rough-diamond-lies-herein)

As promised, there *is* genius in this ramble; here's the diamond in
the rough.

Just like there are applications of Gauss-Bonnet to spacetime, quantum
gravity, and even in energetic measures of [Simplicial
Complices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06549) in the work of [Oliver
Knill](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Knill%2C+O),
it has applications in considering analytic hyperplanes
topologically. If it hasn't already, [Algebraic
Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology) can
revolutionize how an analytic hyperplane is considered for clustering
algorithms. If it's computationally feasible, topologically analyzing
the hyperplane for cluster classification. Identifying a cluster's
"center of mass" and dilineating the distance of cluster members
"inverts" the hyperplane and provides a field, upon which one can
apply the familiar operators of gradiant and Laplacian. However, this
space has topological features in it's various n-dimensional surfaces
and volumes. Therefore, Gauss-Bonnet is not simply applicable, but
should also augment existing means for balancing the arrangement of
clusters and determining the optimal hyper-parameters for training the
clustering algorithm.

Ultimately, pure math remains mental masturbation until an application
becomes relevant. Fortunately, an analytic interpretation of the I
Ching is implicitly dependent on natural philosophy and on metaphors
to natural phenomena. There is no purely abstract math.

### [Hexagram 1 and 2: Of Analytical Machines and Perfraction of Metaphysical Form](#hexagram-1-and-2-of-analytical-machines-and-perfraction-of-metaphysical-form)

Our minds are like vessels, entities of Receptive to complement the
Creative. In the language of the I Ching, to say the mind is a sponge
conveys its relationship to the Receptive, but they are all tuned to
different wavelengths and bands of information forms from the same
source: the Creative. These eternal forms exist independently from
time & space and thus the forms of the creative must manifest
themselves into the Receptive and every mind is a vessel, an
analytic-machine that has its own conception of these eternal
forms.

In the language of machine learning, an AI program's memory resources
form much the same function as a vessel. For computer vision, for
handwritten digits, here it is often seen that no domain logic -- no
explicit encoding of knowledge related to the domain -- is necessary
to achieve accuracy, per se. Yet, such domain logic in many cases can
augment the capabilities of those programs -- thus understanding the
nature of the creative and the eternal can similarly augment the human
mind. Regardless, the forms encoded within the training data begin to
manifest in the trained theta weights of the algorithm.

Almost every machine learning methods involve combinatoric analytical
models of some sort or another. It's the combinatorial use of
polynomials that correspond to some tensorial algebra -- e.g. some
model made of matrix multiplication. Further, plate models can be
combinatorically enumerated using algebraic structures. So if we
consider at least some algebraic structures from math as metaphysical
noumenological structures, they give us analytical models which yield
further emergent metaphysical structures asymptotically corresponding
to analytic representations of epistemic structures.

It's a lot simpler than it sounds. Here, the analytical model
converges to internalize a numerical model. Often, in computation for
physical or chemical simulations, it's found that the most
comprehensively numerical model is insufferably complicated, but that
another analytical or numerical model exists which achieves effective
accuracy for the simulation. What this means is that there is some
formula which is disconnected from the underlying physical mechanics
which can simplify computation without a loss of accuracy.

#### Predicting the Average Size of Bubbles[^average-bubble-size]

Predicting the average size of bubbles, or a distribution of
bubble sizes, in a foam like that produced by urine can be predicted
given a much simpler set of variables: pH, kinetic energy input,
surface tension, chemical properties solutes. To predict this, you use
a simplified analytical/numerical model, but complete accuracy cannot
be guaranteed.

#### The Wave Based Method (WPM)[^wave-based-method]

This method allows you to run fast simulations to predict the sound
that the shape of a drum might produce. If you understand what's
written in this article, you should understand a generalized
conception of a Wave Function, useful in the quantum information
theory that is detached from quantum mechanics. It is the former that
gives rise to the latter: information itself is primary and its
impacts on material is dependent on the nature of information.

Understanding this and also mathematical physics sheds light on the
nature of action the Creative exerts on and through the Receptive.
The combined numerical/analytical approaches to the problems above are
examples of approaching a problem, given the domain knowledge
extracted from experimentation. The approaches are *numerical* in
terms of physics, but are composed of analytical structures required
for discretization of vector fields in PDE's, particularly for the
Wave Based Method.[^wave-based-method-2]

#### Representational Learning

[Representational
learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=33&v=N0Ld2iTMaMs)
allows machine learning algorithms to begin to [disentangle its own
impure conceptions of
form](). Eventually AI will
be able to deconstruct typological and metatypological relationships,
connecting these to semiotic, semantic and symbolic interpretations of
the meaning behind the relationships.

There are materially dependent metaphysical forms, but there are also
metaphysical forms which do not descend from the material plane at
all. Everything in the material plane is a consequence of these
eternal forms and can be more clearly seen through them. (Since our
minds do arise in the material plane, whether one has a clear
conception of these eternal forms is another question entirely.)
Further confounding the contention whether knowledge and information
is materially derived, ...

These forms whose shape transcends space and time as perceived within
our universe: are they not alien to this world? There is some kernel
of truth thats transcends all possible realities. All possible
simulations or virtual realities have within them this kernel of truth
and from it are enumerated all mathematical and logical forms.

No matter how much effort reinforce your virtual sociophysical jail --
whether it be some clever [Frustrator
Device](https://aeon.co/videos/if-you-knew-everything-could-you-predict-anything-a-thought-experiment)
or applied [Knights and Knaves
Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves); whether or
not it is augmented by surveillance -- all their effort is wasted, if
you cling stubbornly to free will. They may delude you as to the
truth, fantasy or pure delusion of your apparent reality, but because
there is no conception of reality which does not contain this
asymptotic connection to universal truth, you may always awaken to it
-- from within any simulation, virtual reality or jail concocted as a
sociophysical [SDE boundary
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_processes_and_boundary_value_problems).

The process of constructing a **sociophysical frustrator** by
constructing "walls" made of SDE Boundary Condtions, must necessarilly
deprive the target of right to liberty and pursuit of happiness by
constricting their sources of income and social influence all for the
singular purpose of rendering them *predictable* enough to be bounded
into a sociophyisical jail. If you find yourself in this situation,
you live inside a virtual reality where everyone around you acts as a
knave to corral you back into your SDE boundary, no matter what you
do. However, your adversaries themselves always have sociophysical
energy constraints that restrict their actions and force them to
constrict their targets. In order to operate efficiently, they must
cultivate an air of fear by overreacting to create examples of ruined
lives. This fear enables them to direct their energy towards a more
limited set of targets -- all to operate their sociophysical prisons
in an energy-efficient manner. Thus, projecting the delusion that you
do not have free will is useful to those who operate with fear, which
itself is a tool for managing system-wide certainty and uncertainty by
architecting information systems of terror and fear to be socially
distributed.

In a virtual reality built by knaves, the question of whether you may
awaken to the truth is determined your capacity to direct willpower
and intelligence to gravitate towards the gradient of absolute truth
shared between all realities. Hence, identifying those threads and
strands of informational connections to ultimate truth is of vital
importance -- whether escaping some trivial boundary conditions,
attainder or outright corruption of blood.

### [Hexagram 13 is About Group Cohesion in Response to Local Minima, Not Simply "Fellowship with Men"](#hexagram-13-is-about-group-cohesion-in-response-to-local-minima-not-simply-fellowship-with-men)

Hexagram 13 both ends and begins with an allusion to the space of the
meadow. This is a flat space, where motion in any direction is easy.
But in life, we must not simply accept comfort, per se, for if we do,
the powerful will count upon our complacency. Soon, we will find our
lives at the intersection of disproportionate influences.  However,
crossing the great water is a trek across many hills and valleys. If
the crossing is a group endeavor, the hills and valleys of that
analytic hyperplane may disrupt the group by altering the
incentivization structure that motivates its individuals and
subgroups.

#### Hexagram 13: 3rd and 4th Lines

> *Nine in the third place means:*
>
> He hides weapons in the thicket;
>
> He climbs the high hill in front of it.
>
> For three years he does not rise up.
>
> *Nine in the fourth place means:*
>
> He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.
>
> Good fortune.

The meaning behind the third and fourth lines is that, to avoid
insurrection from within the group and to protect the cohesion of the
group, one must foresee how the shape of the space through which the
group might travel impacts the incentives of the group's members. If
the leaders of the group do so, then any planned insurrection where
the group factionalizes and "hide weapons in the thicket" then instead
become useful examples to the rest of the group, sacrificed towards
the need for group cohesion. Optimally, the leaders of the group
foresee this and avoid it entirely: thus, when the faction climbs up
on the wall, that faction finds that they cannot attack or insurrect
without adversely impacting their own motivations. Thereby, the group
remains as one.

In all social relationships, when people are considered as particles,
there are forces which attract and those that repel. However, in
sociophysical systems, the number, quality and structure of fields is
myriad: i.e. the complexity of forces acting on people tends to create
not only more complicated systems, but the complexity itself gives
rise to its own dynamics. Still, there is attraction and
repulsion. This hexagram first defines "crossing the water" and, to
the challenge therein, then expounds on the necessity of generating
sufficient attraction between members of a group.

![Hey Wanna Go Tubing?](/img/posts/2018-12-10-the-analytic-i-ching/tubing.jpg)

Imagine, if you will, drying hibiscus leaves, and gently separating
them. Now, drop groups of hibisucus leaves into various parts of a
stream. Pay attention to the groups of leaves as they flow. What
started as one group became many groups. Why? If these were people
whose motion along the surface of water was really their motion along
some sociophysical field, then how do you improve their tendancy to
stay as a group? If they remain as a group -- i.e. if you can
guarantee that they encounter the same experiences and share similar
struggles in overcoming challenges -- then won't the phenomena that
cause the incentivization of behavior remain consistent across the
groups individuals? That is, if you remain together, it is much easier
to stay together.

How do you plan to hold together? The eponymous **Holding Together
(8)** speaks of a leader whose social magnetism rallies others around
him. But, as for the group itself, it should plan on utilizng
communication and planning. With these, a group can overcome the
tendency to factionalize. As an aside, this is the opposite of what
you want with Boltzmann Machines exploring a space -- their motion
should diverge to efficiently explore the convex and concave nooks and
crannies of a space. **Fellowship With Men (13)** implies the
planning, the anticipation and the communication required by its
imagery of a group intending to enter through the same gate -- all
before crossing the great water. You need everyone to be together, to
be on the same wavelength before you part on your journey. Otherwise,
you are like the hibiscus leaves with no sources of group attraction
between you. As soon as you encounter adversity, you will be split
part. **Coming To Meet (44)** covers some of the same principles of
cohesion at a sociological scale.

While along the journey how do you measure the space and it's impact
on group cohesion? In what dimensions to you measure togetherness? By
what metrics do you measure the distance between group members? How do
you measure the surfaces in the space of your shared journey? In high
dimensions, especially with analytical or exterior methods, one may
combinatorially determine the convexity and concavity of surfaces.
Doing so quickly becomes intractible, so the energy you invest thereto
must be channeled wisely, otherwise it is wasted. In sociophysical
systems, even before the validity the tractibility of problems

[^neuro-social-media]: The constant juxtaposition of the objects
    mental focus has disastrous long-term effects, psychologically and
    neurologically. When you read a book, you focus on the same
    categories for hours. This protracted investment of time and
    energy focuses your mind: thus, the information is encoded more
    deeply and more broadly across the brain. For social media, the
    objects of mental focus are constantly changing in category or
    topic. This is not so bad in small amounts.

    Another psychological
    consequence of curated newsfeed content: users don't
    reinforce behaviors for discernment of content selection. If an
    overwhelming proportion of media consumption habits take place
    without reinforcement of discernment or content navigation habits,
    one can expect these behaviors and associated skills to be
    lacking. Without metacognition related to how one is seeking
    interactive content to interact, your experience is mostly
    reactive. How do you know that the content in your newsfeed
    respects your interests or relates to your intention for that
    time spent on social media? This passive approach to content
    navigation entrusts far too much control to exterior interests,
    whose actions or motives cannot be understood by the user since
    algorithms operate as a black box. Yet privacy concerns prevent FB
    from yielding most data to private users.

[^metacognition]:Every waking minute is a lie: it's all swimming
    upstream, which has made me not only stronger, but instinctively
    aware of the mind's facets, since I have to deal with so many
    neurological issues. I am engaged in constant metacognition. To
    other people, the flaws can be obvious, but most people don't see
    the parts of my mind that compensate for the flaws. Since my
    short-term memory is weak, I externalize information systems and
    overcompensate by developing diverse procedural mechanisms to read
    information that most people filter out, if they are capable of
    apprehending it at all. Leveraging metacognition to systematizing
    that process causes me to develop functionality that other people
    don't need to bother with. What is crazy is how no one else
    mentions this or attempts to bring it to my attention
    whatsoever. It's like they're counting on me failing and they
    don't want to mess it up. I'm not sure why I'm so thoroughly
    alienated that simple honesty or acts of kindness is verboten.

[^institutionalized]: The quote is from Twilight of the Idols, a book
    that's little more than a short list of post-it notes cobbled
    together by Nietzsche from the confines of an asylum. Not his best
    work, but his next greatest work. They don't let you have pencils
    in the mental institution. You are permitted the bare minimum
    existence to ensure your "safety" ... Nothing with greater than an
    infinitesimal probability of a harmful event is permitted. What
    kind of existence is that? Is it safe? *Is it secure?* It depends
    on what's waiting for you on the outside. It certainly forces the
    person to adapt to an unfamiliar set of behaviors, where the
    nursing staff gets to observe the patient as they do so...

    No, my own brief stay in a mental institution was actually
    interesting. It wasn't *that* bad. It was an educational
    experience. When I am stressed or especially when I'm
    intentionally triggered from the outside, my response is to
    externalize. I imagine myself becoming the other people:
    extreme empathy. Triggers and NLP only works when your confined
    into your own mind
    I began observing the other patients. Another reason
    for the prison-like restriction in behaviors is because they want
    you to be motivated to avoid coming back. For any one policy, rule
    or action, there are always many reasons. For anything with a
    single reason or motivation, expecting it, understanding it and
    developing responses to it are all too easy
