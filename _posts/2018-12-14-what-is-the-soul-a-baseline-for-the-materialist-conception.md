So many people accept at face value either some identity given to them
by others or perhaps the assumed identity developed by a younger
self. They stop looking or maybe they've never looked much at
all. This is what's so dangerous about the materialist misconception
that *there is no soul!* What do you mean by that? Do you even know?
To the person who needs soul-searching, if they believe the soul
resides entirely within some internalized encoding of matter,
then they allow the noise of life to define all they see and all they
think. They believe the extent of their soul to exist entirely
separately of society and this is a dangerous assumption because it
deprives the person of power over their mind, over their life and over
the composition of their soul."

What is the soul? How is the soul structured? Is my soul separate from
yours? How is it socially distributed? How does it impact the mind?
How can it be measured or known? How does belief impact this
definition of the soul? Do impacts on the mind arising from a
informational basis (viz. epistemic basis) affect the soul? Do they
affect the brain?

Why do materialists get a free pass for causing harm to others via
turbulence and carnage of a socioinformational kind? When someone is
defamed and nailed down with socially distributed belief to be
tormented by the remainder of their life, why does society believe
this is permissible? Why is it so easy for people in society to
believe that such torment is simply mental illness and a "chemical
imbalance"? If this is so patently false, then isn't it a convenient
false paradigm? Architect someone's suffering via insinuation, the
rumor mill and defamation -- they will suffer for the rest of their
life, until their mind is chemically destroyed by pharmaceuticals.
Yet, the false paradigm of "a chemical imbalance" means that nothing
will be done to address the true socio-epistemic causes of mental
illness -- is it because there is nothing that no person or group can
do to ameliorate the suffering of some individuals? How can this be
so? What God would create the possibility for social information
viruses to cause such unrelenting torment for individuals who will
suffer for the remainder of their lives, but never understand why?

# [From the Soul, Defined, to Jung's Individuation](#from-the-soul-defined-to-jungs-individuation)

At the end of her [third
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTrc7zmBh1M&t=0s&index=5&list=PLC4D19CAA84861524)
on I Ching, [Nana Akosua Baakan
Agyeiwaah](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC4D19CAA84861524),
makes a very simple statement that resonates powerfully, *if you
understand what the soul is*. It doesn't necessarily require the
definition of the soul outlined in this article. Still, whatever your
definition of the soul, this statement is very powerful:

> The oracle is a vehicle to help us listen to our soul speak, but we
> must be *quiet* if we are to hear what our soul is trying to speak
> to us.

I have come to realize recently that I don't know what the soul is
... More clearly, despite the prevalance of the word in all forms
culture, including that of religion, new age, agnosticism and atheism,
I have never bothered to reach a personal consensus or definition of
the term. What is it? Listening to Agyeiwaah's videos accelerated my
exploration of the soul as a concept. Isn't it strange that while so
many of us believe so strongly for or against the soul, I made it more
than thirty years without bothering to clarify some self-understanding
of the soul? Or is it that I am incapable of defining it? How is it
possible that I wouldn't know what the soul is, when its existence (or
lack thereof) is so universal and so necessary to belief systems? This
universality contributes greatly to confusion over its existence: your
concept of soul is not my concept of soul.

When considering the soul from a materialist's perspective --
i.e. operating with a limited set of typical materialist tools -- then
one can extrapolate from some basis of axioms, which extend to
pan-psychism. To be clear, these conclusions do not rely whatsoever on
Quantum Woo: they are a consequence of reflections of internalized
information representations in matter and life. There is no dependency
on quantum mechanical effects, which are rendered all but moot by the
chaos of thermodynamics at reasonable temperatures. See the footnote
for an explanation that connects the dots between evolution,
biophysics, information representation, and delineation between self
and other.[^biophysics-and-information-representation]

I have come to understand the soul as a cross between the psyche of
Carl Jung and the socially distributed belief or memory relating to
someone's identity. There may be more to the soul, but until such is
proven, it requires accepting more premises than the materialist is
willing to accept.

<a name="the-soul-is-not-contained-entirely-within-your-body" />

### [The Soul Is Not Contained Entirely Within Your Body](#the-soul-is-not-contained-entirely-within-your-body)

The first statement: if the soul exists purely within us, why would we
need to listen to it speak? We should already know what the soul is.
There are aspects of our soul which exist outside of us, whether this
is information that exists substantiated in material form or
connections to elements within the *astral plane* or shards of our
soul that exist in some purely incorporeal plane.

From my own shortcomings in communication, what I've learned is to
listen to others. By listening to Nana Akosua, I've learned a lot and
I can tell that she has the same *a postieri* familiarity with
philosophical and spiritual concepts that I do; it is simply developed
with more wisdom, practice *and contact with people.* I've learned a
lot from watching her videos. However, my own weaknesses thereof have
taught me to examine more deeply the experience and word of others for
substance, *not appearance of substance*. True substance lies within
and her message exudes spiritual authenticity. If I can't listen to
others, how the hell could I expect them to listen to me?

<a name="if-the-soul-is-not-purely-internal-then-how-does-one-know-their-own-soul" />

### [Then How Does One Know Their Own Soul?](#then-how-does-one-know-their-own-soul)

The second statement: she implies we must be still to separate
ourselves from the noise of life that interferes with the vibrations
from our soul. We need to develop that sense of a soul connection, so
that our actions *resonate* with our deeper, more authentic self -- it
is found *somewhere* in our soul, but it might not exist within us
already. To me, this means to pull back from the noise of life and
calibrate our spiritual connection.

<a name="one-does-not-simply-accept-their-identity" />

### [One Does Not Simply Accept Their Identity](#one-does-not-simply-accept-their-identity)

So many people accept at face value either some identity given to them
by others or perhaps some assumed identity developed by a younger
self. They stop looking or maybe they've never looked much at
all. This is what's so dangerous about the materialist misconception
that *there is no soul!* What do you mean by that? Do you even know?
To the person who needs soul-searching, if they believe the soul
resides entirely within some internalized encoding of matter, then
they allow the noise of life to define all they see and all they
think. They believe the extent of their soul to exist entirely
separately of society and this is a dangerous assumption because it
deprives the person of power over their mind, over their life and over
the composition of their soul.

<a name="didnt-i-say-that-her-statement-had-a-powerful-effect-on-me" />

### [Didn't I Say That Her Statement Had A Powerful Effect?](#didnt-i-say-that-her-statement-had-a-powerful-effect)

If you can manage to separate yourself from the mental mazes that
life's trappings has you running in your mind, then you can start to
zero out life's noise wherefore you calibrate a clearer picture of
true self -- who is not *one*, but *many*. Your soul contains within
it all your potential selves: some unrealized; others that have
remained out of focus; more still are as yet unknown to you, without
further knowledge of self! This knowledge of self provides a
collection of lenses and perspectives that form a kind of a microscope
for your mind, your soul and your self. What seems blurry today should
seem more clear tomorrow. And iff you tune this scope of self
knowledge, then you'll see your composite actualized selves coalescing
from your self awareness breaking through threshold shadows of
unconscious.

This song's lyrics are deep. Real deep. Like everything else k-os
writes, it's a smorgasboard of symbolism and that tends to create an
onion, the layers of which you can peel back year after year, finding
new food for thought and never quite making it to the center. As for
k-os, whose name means knowledge of self, this was the first song of
his I had heard and it captivated me *because of it's cry to defend
authenticity.* Technically, I had heard Superstarr Part Zero before.
That song is like bliss to the ears of a padawan B-Boy, but it wasn't
until I bought the album that I realized it was the same artist. CD's
and life before Shazam, eh? What makes something worth finding? *Can
you google that?*

For me, today, those lines are about escaping some preconceived
construction of an identity that is not only forced upon us, but seems
to be hopelessly prevalent in society. Is it a true conception of
one's identity? If the doors of opportunity are closed and if you are
excluded, how do you change the distorted belief that bars them shut?

### [Are The Myriad Fragments of Your Soul Searching For Knowledge of Self?](#are-the-myriad-fragments-of-your-soul-searching-for-knowledge-of-self)

The true key is to listen to people: they contain within them
fragments of your soul that you must collect. Even if they have no
idea who you were, their experience deposits layers of
conceptualization onto their notion of your identity. You must listen
to find inner truth: there is substance that resides in others, but if
it is valuable, it usually may not be found at the surface. **If you
do not listen**, *you cannot see
clearly*.[^metaphor-of-platonic-sight] If someone has made it so that
you cannot hear others at all, then you may be lost for some time. If
you're lucky, you find that most of your newfound selves are also
searching for their knowledge of self: the fragments of your soul or
socially distributed self are themselves searching for self. When you
develop a clearer resolution of self, you begin collecting information
from these socially distributed fragments that key you in to your
whole soul, entirely. This will lead you to your true self, but if you
are not *still*, you cannot *listen*. Once you learn to listen, you
can begin to learn to perturb the local social configuration to then
filter and percolate inferences about those scattered fragments of
soul. Explanations of
[perturbation](#play-is-social-perturbation-for-children) and
[percolation](#children-please-get-your-symplectic-manifolds-and-turn-to-the-section-on-percolation)
for the layman are included further in.

<a name="the-formation-of-the-interface-between-psychee-and-unconscious" />

### &#9312; [The Formation of the Interface Between Psyche and Unconscious](#the-formation-of-the-interface-between-psychee-and-unconscious)

Perhaps driven by some miraculous accident in youth, when your psyche
still nascent forming shone a light unto the right unconscious corners
, then perhaps this configured the interface between one's psyche and
the unconscious in some miraculous way. To what end? To Seek
continuous self improvement without the defect of a false sense of
completion after one learns so much of the world. How does one stay on
the path?  How does one stay course on the Hero's Journey? Does the
hero with the longest journey result with unsurpassed heroic
development?

<a name="an-unconscious-metatype-in-the-reward-systems-framework" />

### &#9313; [An Unconscious Metatype In The Reward System's Framework](#an-unconscious-metatype-in-the-reward-systems-framework)

Some miracle compels the early and prevalent formation of a metatype
in your psyche's reward system(s) that pushes you towards
self-awareness and self-improvement for some higher goal, wherefore
the true extent of which you must remain somewhat unconscious. If you
can define the extent of your goals in totality, then they are not
great enough to compel you onwards along the Hero's journey. It must
be something seemingly insurmountable that you will master because you
must overcome it, not because you understand it or are yet capable of
deconstructing it. This is the true path to awakening and
self-actualization: it is indeed *not* medication, IMO, though that
may help some to numb their pain, from which their circumstances might
change enough to enable change... Yet, isn't there a purpose to pain?
It's a signal like no other, and it's there for a reason.

What compels people towards rending the insuperable into some short
list of a dozen herculean feats, despite all the doubts, the pains and
your ensuing fears? What is that heroic version of ourselves towards
which we orient ourselves upwards? Is there a single such version?
It's some miraculously twisted rewards systems whose shape and
configuration are the result of slow and steady precipitation of life
experience. This is not unlike the stalagtites and stalagmites of
caves, whose shapes can change but whose range of potential change are
all but set, *diffeomorphically* once they start forming. Freudian
ideas are all about the shape of the psyche's earliest kernel: how
initial experience, especially before the conscious mind can
adequately recognize or model behaviors, sets in motion developmental
dynamics that have a greater effect on *change* the mind than most
later life developments could ever have. Freud's ideas were about
building a dictionary-like taxonomy of nascent psychological
developmental progressions that would allow the therapist to
*classify* the patient's current perspectives and developmental
potential in terms of the past. Yet, why must our flexibility for
psychological change be petrified in any way by the past?

<a name="whatever-it-is-your-psyches-configuration-hides-a-miracle" />

### &#9314; [Whatever It Is, Your Psyche's Configuration Hides A Miracle](#whatever-it-is-your-psyches-configuration-hides-a-miracle)

If you were unconscious to what drove you to seek self-improvement by
expanding knowledge of self, then it might more strongly express
itself almost as if by instinct. One does not simply "turn off" that
of which one is unaware. Therefore, mid-development, as you begin to
awaken to the sophisticated metacognition and the self-reflection
required for self-actualization, then that instinctual compulsion has
perhaps given you quite a head start.

The socially distributed variation in the diversity of human
experience and of *psychic* configuration -- the configuration of
one's psyche -- [is in itself
miraculous](/posts/2018-03-04-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity.html). Every
flower is beautiful in its own way. It is up to you to find those
jewels hidden in your psyche. Somewhere buried within your mind, your
memories and even the trauma, there is to be found another miracle
that gives you purpose. There must be and if you find it not, then you
make it.

The corollary: It is horrible when people refuse to enable any
progression from your current state. They look upon your manufactured,
fabricated identity -- over which you had little control -- and
short-circuit all progress. ALL WITHOUT COMMUNICATING WITH YOU ABOUT
IT. They never intended you to succeed and they never cared.

<a name="catalysis-of-individuation-the-keystone-of-self-actualization" />

### &#9315; [Catalysis of Individuation: The Keystone of Self-Actualization](#catalysis-of-individuation-the-keystone-of-self-actualization)

To catalyze self-actualization requires disaggregating the influences
on your mind that spawned so many selves that were...  so the most
significant versions of them can be known and reverse-engineered. If
you like, combine this idea with [Piaget's genetic
epistemology](https://youtu.be/BQ4VSRg4e8w). After the disaggregation
of socially distributed self is reverse-engineered, then those
modified selves must be reoriented towards an end-goal and wherefore
reaggregated. In necessarily terse terms, this sums of the process of
individuation from society -- by deconstructing and reconstructing the
socially distributed self.

Once you have disaggregated your socially distributed self, you must
reorient your self ... from there, it's warp-speed all the way. That
is, until you must reassess your location in quadrant four.

# [Doxastic Games: Telephone and The Rumor Mill](#doxastic-games-telephone-the-rumor-mill-and-your-eternal-torment)

Understanding how people understand your identity is critical. We all
operate, given some notion of self, by comparing our sense of self
with that of the identity of others. People play [epistemic
games](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-game/) and
doxastic games[^doxastic-games]. These are games centered around
projection and propagation of knowledge or belief. There are many
board games which are formalized conceptions of these and the
magnificent thesis in the footnote discusses doxastic games in terms
of some well-known boardgames, like [One Night Ultimate
Werewolf](https://www.amazon.com/Bezier-Games-Night-Ultimate-Werewolf/dp/B00HS7GG5G)
and
[Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi). Understanding
the ideas of epistemic, doxastic and deontic games *with depth*
requires [incredibly deep knowledge of
logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqtZrzI_ko) with applied game
theory[^mat-science-playlist]. Try to watch the videos I just linked:
I dare you LMAO. Essentially, these are games where beliefs are
projected among players or through society. **Telephone** and **The
Rumor Mill**: these are also doxastic games.

> "Explain it to them like they're five" they said...

Your conceived image of self has refracted into myriad images in
society. The collective set of memories that members of society have
formed about you compose your social memory. The individual
recollections of experience can be activated almost like files are
opened on a computer. Individuals in society collectively guide their
attention towards memories that are each associated with collections
of identities.

The strategy and tactics of **meme magic** and **viral marketing** are
deontic games because it relates to dispersion of memes into social
media, understanding how norms will form *before normification
occurs*, and how people will orient themselves to norms *as
normification occurs*. Don't simply believe it because I told you so
-- "You have to actually know what you're talking about", *they* said
-- so here's crazyman, he'll explain and he's probably got one of
those college degree things.

### [aEternal Torment of the Soul Is A Doxastic Game](#eternal-torment-of-the-soul-is-a-doxastic-game)

People can torment you, perhaps eternally, by targeting those
fragments of your soul scattered through society. If they are better
at playing doxastic games, they can strongly influence the social
residue of your soul to distort the collective social memories that
relate to your identity. In extreme cases, they can torment your
aeternal soul perhaps for all time. It requires power. Power over such
horrible, *paltry* people requires power itself. When you find you
have none, power is best obtained through knowledge. Knowledge is
power.

<!-- This was the fundamental flaw in ancient Judaism that required a
Messiah, according to early Christians. The Messiah would be required

One thing about Fabrication: the perpetrators do not want to leave a
paper trail, especially when they cannot anticipate what the
steganographer is going to type. They have to cover their tracks. Did
[Bobby Blankenship](https://github.com/dcunited001/bb8) want court
records. Hell motherfucking no! They will bluff it, but if you size it
up *and truly recognize fabrication for what it is*, then you can call
their call their bluff. You don't need to look at their cards. It
doesn't matter anyways, *THEY'RE
CHEATERS!*. [#BB8](https://github.com/dcunited001/bb8). #Surveillance
(somehow)...

If you bind people down with fabricated information or belief, that is
wrong. It is especially easy to do to the ignorant, the young ... or
people with Asperger's. Society turned me into a doll into which they
could stuff all of *their* bad karma and send into the desert: a
literal scapegoat. And they did it by keeping me in a prison of
unconsciousness, without ever intending to help me change. Wrong,
wrong wrong, wrong, WRONG!

By encouraging sin in youth, people are intrinsically disempowered,
often for the rest of their lives. This was the reason Jesus flipped
the tables of moneychangers, *who stood to profit if sin was
encouraged*.  This story was single example of an angry Jesus. More
sin, more money. Today: more sin, more doxastic leverage: more power
over people. While that story applies to *Ancient Judaism's* flaws of
executing theological ideas in its social institutions, what is to be
underscored here is the potential for people to be enslaved by sin in
their youth. Perhaps sin is a loaded term: more clearly, I mean
information about sin or wrongdoing or unethical action or immoral
justification. Before the person has understanding of the doxastic
consequences of their actions, their wings are clipped in a gradual
process. By depriving people of knowledge or of access to a *modern
belief system*, then people are deprived of the ability to circumvent
doxastic leverage. When such belief system(**s**) begin to emerge,
watch in amazement as authorities censor the hell out of what deprives
them of the ability to enslave youth via sin.

Still think religion has no value?

### [The Truth Is *Always* Convergent](#the-truth-is-always-convergent)

The truth about belief in doxastic games? It does not hold a candle to
truth. Light *is* truth and *light reveals all*. Light does not need
strategy or tactics. Light walks in the truth; the truth walks in the
light. Whether one who exemplifies truth walks in the shadow of the
valley of death, threats do not matter: *TRUTH* is your eternal
guardian. Threats will be rendered moot; swords raised against you
will hesitate and become uncertain. Your enemies will question
themselves. All you have to do is be capable of walking in the light
and magickally, your threats will be rendered moot. When you leverage
the truth as your shield, you truly leverage your own innocence. Thus,
if there is a single crack, any enemies will relish in your
destruction. You walk a fine line, but if you manage it, your threats
will cancel out if they manifest at all. To do so is often to give up
greatness and only the truly great can wield power with truth in the
light. To do so requires faith in the truth as a shield, faith in the
process and an understanding that is difficult to come by *without
religion*. If you cannot connect the dots between Psalm 23 and the
power of truth as a guardian, then you need to go to school. To
devalue religion as ancient, pre-modern, non-scientific hocus pocus is
the pinnacle of ignorance.

### [Our Specialty? It's Fabrication](#our-specialty-its-fabrication)

For any fabrication operation, pulling the wool over someone's eyes is
essential: they must be constantly lied to, deprived of information
necessary to their responsibilities at work, etc. Why?  So that when
the preordained endgame occurs, the disinformation and misinformation
enshrouds the apprehension that the righteous has of the truth. They
reach for the truth as their weapon or their shield, but they do not
have it. It was pre-meditated fabrication: the "truth" manufactured
and little more -- to a limited audience, which is why startups are
perfect. Where there was one fabrication operation, there are
many. There's no handbook for fabrication: it's a difficult skill to
teach because its edge is dulled when the general public is aware of
the possibility of intentionally manufactured circumstances. It's just
not effective when people expect it: they become cynical and
skeptical. They ask questions. They gain insight: therefore the
public's powers of deduction, abduction and induction are magnified
when the spatial complexity of logic is reduced by gradual coalescence
of the truth.

### [Ever Since Pontius Pilate, One Hand Washes The Other](#ever-since-pontius-pilate-one-hand-washes-the-other)

The story of Jesus was perhaps the biggest coverup in history. Whose
coverup? After two millenia, no one will ever know the answer to
that. Proof of the historical Jesus is to be found by abduction:
reading the why's between the lines.

> "You're going to need a lot of faith, my dude" - Jesus

Jesus really drove home that *faith without proof* thing. If there
*was* a historical Jesus, it's as though that shrewd player expected
every move the Romans and Jews would make.  He knew they'd cover up
all those pesky *revolutionary* questions he asked, like **"wherefore
art thou , meek?"** -- to paraphrase with Shakespearean eloquence, in
case you read Romeo and Juliet, but never understood that line.

> "And the *blind* and the *lame* came to Him in the temple; and He
> healed them." -- Matthew 21:14

Where does it say that Jesus toyed with the lives of the weak or
protected them from the truth? He opened their eyes and healed the
sick. He empowered the people for being what they were: people. Ever
individual has inherent power they produce. In the I Ching, this
energy is fire as discussed in [Hexagram 37:
Family](http://the-iching.com/hexagram_37_to_hexagram_24). This is an
individual's inherent ability to produce and accumulate power, no
matter whether rich or poor, through the social group(s) to which they
are most tightly connected. Hexagram 37 is about leveraging tight
connections to be an efficient social power generator. To do so
requires *knowledge*. Knowledge is power. Jesus opened the eyes of the
poor and healed the lame. He empowered the meek. For this and other
'blasphemies' he was crucified by the Jews *and Romans.*

The Romans and Jews *thought* they had killed the enlightened Jesus:
the Jesus whose soul lived on in others. The Romans and Jews were
engaged doxastic games: to purge an enlightened individual's image
from society, you must hunt down all images in the collective social
memory that reference their identity and reshape them. You can
brainwash people or use other tricks to distract their minds from the
truth. If there are documents, you must destroy them. This is why the
Dead Sea Scrolls were such a magnificent cache: they escaped *all* of
the pre-Dark Age document purges: pre-Nicene and post-Nicene. The
burning of the Library of Alexandria and murdering of scholars in
pre-Han China?  These were engineered tragedies of doxastic games for
power by controlling the seeds of all later scholastic thought.

Moreover, it seems that the soul of Jesus lived on in the form of a
sociophysical programme for building institutions that would continue
the work of Jesus after his death ... a programme bounded to the
limits of the materialistic perspective, perhaps? It then seems that
perhaps his death was not only anticipated but also necessary for you
can kill a person, but you cannot kill an idea.

### [Why Did Adam And Eve Hide From God?](#why-did-adam-and-eve-hide-from-god)

Adam and Eve were unconscious to God's unparalleled capacity to
ascertain the commission of their original sin. They symbolize early
mankind's mistakes in committing sins without yet being conscious to
the typologies of consequences of sins, the study of which is covered
by [hamartology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartiology). Yet,
there is no hiding from God, for which the question remains: what is
God? That is a subject for another post. Even for secular sin, you
must hide it or hide from its consequences for the rest of your
life. That's what the story of Jesus was about, in case you missed it
-- freeing man from sin. And if you don't believe in sinful nature or
profiting from the sinful nature of others, then you don't propagate
the methods of doing so, unless it is to empower others for their
defense.

Society has robbed me of the ability to have children in any safe
environment, where they won't simply be used as someone else's pawns,
just like it has robbed me of everything else I might have. The man
who has nothing has nothing to fear. Why do you think Jesus did not
have children? What would Jesus do? Apparently, *he would not have
children.*

# [Reincarnation, Defined In Materialistic Terms](#reincarnation-defined-in-materialistic-terms)

Extrapolating from the baseline for what I'm about to describe, then
one may conceive of reincarnation via metaphor. If one’s psyche is a
compositite of metatypes and archetypes, some more aeternal than
others, then we are all similar to those who've existed before. How
can you tell? Put two people whose composition of types are similar
into similar situations, and if their thought processes are similar,
the outcomes, their responses or their choices should be similar. Is
that really so hard? Again, this extrapolates from the "baseline"
which this article will establish. I am going to compel materialists
to accept at least this much.

<a name="reincarnation-is-psychosocial-type-theory" />

### [Reincarnation is Psychosocial Type Theory](#reincarnation-is-psychosocial-type-theory)

If one defines the psyche has the mind within the constraints of our
body, then in the typological terms of [Type
Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), if the
singleton-types representing some individual's psyche is composed of
metatypes and archetypes that we all share, it becomes straightforward
to compare each others psyche by contrasting type-composition.
Furthermore, if we assume these metatypes and archetypes are drawn
from an interwoven ontology of psychosocial typologies -- which I hope
to eventually map onto a structure similar to E8 to marry the physical
and metaphysical -- then this only strengthens the application of my
baseline of the soul. Given this conception, if we are all so similar
to people who’ve existed before, we might as well say we are “the
reincarnation of X, Y or Z.” That said, it's presumptuous and arrogant
to attempt to define this conception as identical to ideas of rebirth
and reincarnation from world religions.

### [The Soul Is Not What You Think It Is.](#the-soul-is-not-what-you-think-it-is)

There are certainly materialistically derived components of the
soul. If there weren't, psychology would have produced zero results.
There are patterns to the structure of the psyche: there are common
metatypes found in psychology and sociology; there are common
archetypes whitherto extend the components of our singleton
composition of type.

Jung's theory's have simply outpaced science's existing methods of
quantification. So much famous psychological research suffers from the
inability to be reproduced because it attempts to control variables in
extremely non-linear systems whose dimensions are infinite and
convoluted. Data science will change all this, since it allows for
comparison between analytic representations, fitting typological data
from systems (even those of disparate design) into overarching
ontological structures. Although limited by computational capacity,
the key to phenomenology of technology, this can already be done to a
limited degree via analysis using [shapley
values](http://lineardigressions.com/episodes/2018/5/13/shap-shapley-values-in-machine-learning)
that is capable of objectifying and quantifying typological structures
in data that are usually considered purely subjective.

<a name="artificial-intelligence-will-exhibit-jungian-developmental-patterns"

### [Artificial Intelligence Will Exhibit Jungian Developmental Patterns](#artificial-intelligence-will-exhibit-jungian-developmental-patterns)

These jungian developmental patterns will become more plain to see as
AI becomes more advanced and generalized. There are strict limits on
the computational capacity of a single entity, which is why the ideas
in [To Catch A Butterfly: Epistemic Miracles of
Serendipity](/posts/2018-03-04-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity.html)
about diversity of social experience in relation to socially
distributed computation are so important.

Many of Jung's ideas that science has been unable to prove will be
vindicated as artificial intelligence matures. It will become
well-understood that all learning systems exhibit dynamics typical of
Jungian individuation/development; algorithms will congeal the
structure of their analytic representation in terms of or in contrast
to the unconscious biases in their available data; their their
capacity for sudden acceleration in development/progression will pare
the learning systems capacity for generality; they will exhibit
phenomena similar to cycles of progression and regression; the
frequency, quality and degress of each aforementioned phenomena will
be tightly coupled to the computational capacity of the systems and
variance in exposure to data.

Most frightening of all: artificial intelligence will suffer from
mental illnesses, but not merely a subset of human mental illness. No,
artificial intelligence will have its own completely distinct forms of
mental illness. This will *prove* the primarily informational basis
for mental illness -- can you give a machine Prozac? Nope, can't
prescribe anything to AI: just pull the plug. Now, don't you wish it
were that simple every time? The truth is, mental illness is not easy:
the human mind does not have an undo button. How can doctors classify
mental illness in generalized articial intelligence when it will be so
tightly coupled to the G.A.I.'s specific structure and history of
data-ingestion? It's a frightening problem.

Given the above insights that more or less extend the notion of soul
to generalized artificial intelligence, then a purely materialistic
conception of the soul feels a bit cold and depressing, like
non-alcoholic beer with a four-stage "cold activation" that freezes
your brain before the sobering lack of alcohol bottoms your heart
out. If religion is the opiate of the masses...

<a name="what-is-the-soul" />

### [What is the Soul?](#what-is-the-soul)

The materialistic components of the soul are disaggregated shards of
identity -- they exist in the self *and* they are socially distributed

that, you lack imagination or you do not understand Carl Jung

There is *no smatter* contained in this definition of the soul. The
language is intentional. The explanation is clear and if it isn’t,
then you do not undestand the ideas contained therein. The soul
exists, *definitively*. Whether it arises materially or
supernaturally? That is another question entirely. This definition is
a baseline, above which materialists are confined to operate
rhetorically. They must admit at least this and if they don't it means
they are a materialist not well-educated enough on dynamics of
information representations from within a purely material conception
of our world. If you do not understand my definition, then it means
you lack either imagination or intellect. There is no room for
subjectivity in this context. The soul exists. End of story.

Why do militant atheists spit on the memory of Christianity? Even
according to the most educated atheists -- i.e. Richard Dawkins --
concepts such as memetics and holonic information theory imply that

I really do enjoy tearing apart rationalists and atheists.  The
pursuit of out-rationalizing their intellect is like a delicacy to me:
I invert your rationalism and use it against you to tear apart your
conceptions of “purely rational thinking” ... they are as inherently
flawed as they are incomplete. I'm sorry if this offends or insults
you, but I have spent a lot of time thinking: I have nothing better to
do with my time. I do not receive any visible respect and I would
really appreciate it. In other words, you aren’t as rational as you
believe yourself to be, so you probably shouldn’t be so *adamantine*
in your response to ideas outside those you accept as “real” or
“proven”.

If everything just beyond the boundaries of accepted knowledge is
*unproven*, then how does one definitively rationalize about futures
still disjointed from the present? Conceptualizing the barborous
regions just beyond this boundary and strategizing about the potential
futures that evaporate compared to those that crystalize -- that is
**diffeomorphic epistemology**. What is the shape of the body of
knowledge, as either a common person or erudite would perceive to be
rational? How does that shape change upon revelation of impending
contributions to the body of knowledge? Diffeomorphic epistemology is
what you get when you combine the idea of a Kantian Category with
Kant's work on epistemology. Could there have been any other era more
critical for such an understanding of developmental dynamics of
epistemology in the realm of science than in Kant's century?

Which holds more possibility for change: the future, the present or
the past? And which holds more human potential for imagination: an
all-knowing future or mankind's once open road now traveled? Weren't
fantasy and mystery more majestic when that road lay still unbounded
by its certain lack of certainty? What is it like to be there? To
actually be there -- do you know? Can you reason about lack of
knowledge? And from within a lack of knowledge? **"Emulation of
ancient thought is penultimate metacognition"** -- how can you know
all the ways to know each thing?  If you could restrict your mind's
utilization of epistemic structures in argument, then if you ever
found some alternate path leading to what was decidedly modern
knowledge, what are the chances that we've all missed some paths less
traveled? When restricted epistemic exploration is a skill you
strengthen, whether intentionally or by necessity, myriad avenues
begin to appear everywhere your mind takes you.

Kant was far, far ahead of his time, perhaps from a galaxy far, far
away. All the more, Kant *emblematic* of the soon-to-unfold
Enlightenment. Upon extrapolation, the intersection of diffeomorphic
epistemology and spectral informational theory must converge to
produce of a coalescence of [synthetic a

### [What are Perturbations in Adversarial Network Analysis?](#what-are-perturbations-in-adversarial-network-analysis)

What is a perturbation? Well, whether you can explain the answer to
that depends on what kind of rationalist or atheist you are...

Perturbations allow you to inject noise or random behavior into neural
networks and see what comes out. You're basically comparing a system
-- whose pure states are unknown or perhaps unknowable in totality --
with a more idealized system whose states are more clear. This is
accomplished by injecting noise into the former system to see how the
induced changes move its states towards or away from the the latter,
more ideal system. At each step in machine learning, gradient descent
is typically paired with a kind of simplified perturbation without
some known ideal system to compare it to. This simplified kind of
perturbation has noise whose magnitude is controlled via the
algorithms hyperparameters, which control the learning rate.

<a name="play-is-social-perturbation-for-children" />

### [Play is Social Perturbation For Children](#play-is-social-perturbation-for-children)

For children *and adults*, play is social perturbation. Children don't
conceptualize it this way. Since children are still accumulating the
experience that allows them to structure conception of social norms,
beliefs, habits and practices, they engage in a high degree of social
perturbation without intending to. In groups of children, this lack of
concectualization of social norms, beliefs, habits and practices
corresponds to greater degree of flexibility and variety in such
structure. Since such structure is nascent, changing, and far from
concrete, then the experiences children have together -- particularly
play -- produces more randomness for social perturbation. Earlier on,
children are unconscious to their lack of structure, but eventually
become more conscious to it. When you introduce people with more
structure, whether in situations of play or not, children are
receptive to such structure and they become affected by it. However
they do this -- whether it is by imitating it, mirroring it, rebelling
against it, responding to it in some orthogonal way or by presenting
an anti-parallel response to it -- they are parameterizing their
apprehension of novel phenomena with it. This influences ther
cognition of it, their gradual accumulation of structure, etc.

For social applications, artificial perturbation introduces a bit of
noise and play into a situation. The responses people give you allows
you to make inferences related to their psychosocial state: their
rational conception of the interactions, their emotional state. If
someone blocks you from engaging in such noise and play -- e.g. by
claiming you are crazy, blocking your interactions, policing your
dialogue or overanalyzing your responses to "triggers" without
assessing how one's own biases can never truly be muted when judging
another's reactions -- then it becomes difficult to probe the
intellectual or emotional state of others: this will confound your
ability to seek healthy interactions; it deprives you of power over
your circumstances. Such tactics may be well-intentioned, but in the
extreme may suffocate the other person by depriving them of the
ability to experiment, to read social reactions, to be themselves, to
respond, to express themselves and to adapt.

It is easy to convince people that "they are doing it wrong",
socially. If not approached with sufficient communication to identify
how that person changed in response, can you really say that you care
enough to tell them about themselves? In my life, this has been so
unbelievably toxic: my lack of awareness of social phenomena,
mechanics and dynamics left me practically nothing but blank canvas
for others to fill with whatever shit they wanted. Some had the best
intentions, but those skilled in psychology who were malicious did an
unbelievable amount of harm by exacerbating my neuroses and implanting
anxieties. One of the 48 Laws of Power warns about trifling people who
seed slow-growing problems and cultivate enmity in the lives of
others. A neurosis implanted in someone's psyche may be provoked with
varying frequency, but contributes to problems every time that
behavior pattern is triggered and each time, it is almost certainly
reinforced.[^so-yes-i-know]

The idea of percolation simplifies the process of connecting the
emergence of social dynamics to potential later developments. All
types of causal progressions have their partial or total causes. If
some kind of social dynamic is *always* linked to a specific cause,
then by spotting the earlier signs, you can reason about the patterns
that emerge later. There are signs that indicate correlated behavior
patterns in social behaviors, but more critically, there are more
general patterns that convey more information. You can more
effectively reason about potential social cause-and-effect by attuning
yourself to how information about actions and effects implies other
reactions, patterns and effects.

Other examples of using percolation to connect the emergence of signs
of causal progression are less clear, but it is necessary to first
recognize the signs. Social perturbation causes people to react and
present you with tells or it helps indicate propensity for specific
behaviors. If you catch these signs, you can more easily anticipate
later progressions. Thus, you can understand the range of
possibilities much more clearly, but moreover, percolation allows you
to filter out much of the possibility space.

**Thus, you have a better idea of what to expect and *what not to
expect* from people.**

Your grandparents have had lifetimes of crash courses in statistics
for the layman, whether they know it or whether you've figured it
out. Why lifetimes, plural? They have, moreover, adjusted to the
anecdotes shared amongst all their their friends: they begin to absorb
developmental experience from stories about the next generation in
addition to their own. Though this information is mostly anecdotal and
often comes with emotional attachment to the outcomes, simply
understanding that some infinitessimally probable event is possible
changes the game insofar as whether and how events of related type can
be anticipated.

The "psychic" is especially attuned to typologies of events, their
taxonomic speciation and the ontological structures into which they
fit -- here, this dubious term is referred to in quotes to distinguish
it from literal psychic, in which I do not believe. Why? The notion of
a literal psychic deprives my mind of the strenuous exercise in
metacognition that it so deserves: *what are all the possible ways to
know* -- of which I have not yet have conceived?

How can a five year-old understand the idea of infinitessimal? Disney
perfectly illustrates the significance of such events with the archery
contest in Robin Hood.

#### For A Statistical Model Not Accounting For Skill...

![Robin Hood](/img/posts/2018-12-14-material-conception-of-soul/robin-hood.jpg)

Now, what are the odds Robin Hood would strike the same target three
times? Infinitessimal again, eh? It depends on your model's ability to
conceptualize the skill of an archer, but most models can not predict
such an event with low likelihood -- much less when it involves
mulitple degrees of infinitessimal. Yet, given a statistical model
that *can* account for skill, could it ever accurately value the
probability of this event?

Most infinitessimal events are not so simply stated as the above: they
are the definition of ineffable -- what makes the event special is not
capable of being put into words. So if a statistical model cannot
define them or classify their interdependencies for the [variational
inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods)
which is the magick glue of deep learning, then how does one tally the
number of times the event has occured? So that future infinitesimal
events can be accurately anticipated in proportion to its near-zero
rate of occurance? Thus is the crux of infinitesimals and their
mysteries may be illuminated by the [Continuum
Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis) and
[Axiom of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice).

Cresting atop the greatest challenges for machine learning algorithms
are infinitesimals: adjusting to the experience of them, accurately
valuating their probability so they don't skew your algorithm,
developing any awareness for the variables which are true causal
influences that variationally precipitate them... **Infinitesimals
break artificial intelligence** and the numerical challenges they
present are only the tip of the iceburg. Regardless of how advanced
the computer that runs them -- statistical models are cursed to be
bound to the same phenomenology of life as humans. Again, for
emphasis: numerical complications are simply the beginnings of
accounting for issues related to infinitesimals. You have to encounter
an event to even hope to accurately define it's probability and the
structure of its interdependent links to other variables in your
model.

**The nature of trauma and psychological responses evoked by them --
these are not phenomena unique to the human condition!** The
psychological impact that trauma has on a mind -- it is a curse that
descends from the nature of information itself. Trauma is a curse to
haunt the minds of any sentient beings, whether artificial or those
made by the hands of some "beneficent" God. We should be so lucky to
be capable of believing in such a God, for even an "omnipotent" being
residing at the zenith of creation can not escape the nature and
bounds of information -- such a being is also bound by the laws of
spatial and temporal complexity, at least insofar as it may manifest
itself through creation. After living through trauma, one should
simply hope to live without such experience being methodically
identified as an effective mechanism of control: to be paired with
some semiotic trigger to implant reactions or delusions useful for
provoking predictably destabalizing psychological responses.

### [Children, Please Get Your Symplectic Manifolds And Turn To The Section on Percolation](#children-please-get-your-symplectic-manifolds-and-turn-to-the-section-on-percolation)

#### Feel free to skip this paragraph...

The combination of perturbation and percolation are incredibly
powerful techniques for understanding high-dimensional systems with
potentially non-linear dynamics. What is a symplectic manifold? From a
pragmatic perspective on its utility, it's a mathematical object that
allows for percolation or filtration of the possibility space. If the
concept of the Hamiltonian is familiar, insights via symplectic
manifolds enable you to reason about equivalent or similar
configurations of particle systems. See the footnote for mind-blowing
implications to metaphysics by understanding how Brouwer's Translation
Theorum requires and necessitates pattern for area-preserving
maps.[^brouwers]

Geologically, the process of cave-formation involves the percolation
of groundwater to fissures in rock. The softer the rock and the
greater the volume of water that flows through it, the faster a cave
forms. The more the cave is carved away, the faster water flows
through this area. Similar to a lightning strike, although on a
geological time scale, when a cave forms in one area, the way it
changes the drainage patterns for that area by accepting and passing
more water reduces or impacts the formation of nearby areas. For
lightning strikes, the dispersion of accumulated charge prevents
lightning from discharging in that area since the neutralized positive
ground charge necessary no longer exerts influence on the aggegate
electrons in rainclouds.

#### The Process of Percolation in Cave Formation[^groundwater-percolation]

![And the Devil always has something to say, huh?](/img/posts/2018-12-14-material-conception-of-soul/percolation.jpg)

Erosion changes the shape of fissures and thereby changes drainage
patterns. Percolation is the funneling of the total volume of water
through these spaces. For physics or statistics models, the
implications of being able to use a symplectic manifold on the clarity
of your model is like having a model of groundwater flow that accounts
for the structure of bedrock, including fissures. Instead of having a
spherical cow that can only model the space naively, your model can
understand how the possibility of some quantity of water would flow
through the available channels and how the shape of those channels
influences the rest of the statistical system. This is your
"ten-thousand foot view from an armchair mathemetician" version of
percolation, a concept that doesn't necessarily rely on symplectic
manifolds.

Here's some posters from [Melinda
Lanius](/img/posts/2018-12-14-material-conception-of-soul/symplectic-1.pdf)
and [Sylvain
Courte](/img/posts/2018-12-14-material-conception-of-soul/symplectic-2.pdf),
which can help visually clarify this concept, although it's still
prohibitively obstruse for the layman.[^symplectic-manifolds]

Symplectic manifolds are a kind of structure for percolation by value
preservation. In physics, this value preservation begins with the
statement of equilibrium in the Hamiltonian -- which essentially
states that energy can not be created or destroyed. This results in
the conceptualization of phase space, but also extends to intuition
around degrees of freedom in surfaces/volumes in phase space. In
statistics, assuming a model is valid, there are similar constraints
of equilibrium and value preservation: each probability distribution
must sum to one. Therefore there are analogies of phase space to
statistics, but how does one measure confidence in the valuations of
probability distributions?

Even though I only understand it's simplest facets, a symplectic
manifold is a special type of manifold that helps you percolate the
possibility space by making assumptions about energy equivalence,
enabling inferences via the nature of degrees of freedom in phase
space or the conceptualization of probability density as a kind of
idea fluid. To the third, ideas from information geometry constrain
values and dynamics in statistical models as though they have
attributes of ideal fluids. [Balancing a tensor
network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08142v3) illustrates this
well.[^balanced-tensors] Even with the determinism of classical
mechanics, there are regions of configuration space and phase space
that require paths through phase space that are exceedingly
unlikely. Why would a stochastic model built on classical mechanics be
relevant, given its determinism?  These are questions I can reason
about, but can't quite clarify without finishing the lectures on
symplectic manifolds. Still, they seem to embody the idea of
percolation for statistical systems: eroding the possibility space of
potential system configurations by leveraging inherent mechanical
constraints and its degrees of freedom.

### [Of Alice and Bob, Networks and Hyperplanes](#of-alice-and-bob-networks-and-hyperplanes)

Let's say Alice and Bob are both working on a college project to
produce the best image-classification network -- for an exam credit in
a course on machine learning. What is exam credit? Fuck if I
know. Anyways, they are both fairly rational and that's also entirely
beside the point. Perhaps the previous three sentences were
irrational. Do I care? Fuck no. Anyways, Alice wants to be first in
clase, so she gets real smart and hacks Bob's computer. Bob is smart
and reads Kaggle posts. He finds a typical Deep neural net
strategy. Every time Bob trains the network, Alice has embedded
malware that sends his training weights to her computer. She's running
the same network. That's what almost everyone on Kaggle does: they run
the best network. The major differences are found in whether a model
incorporates domain knowledge and how it does so, particularly with
regard to hyperparameters and backpropagation.

Alice is real smart though, so she decides to construct a General
Adversarial Network on top of the training weights that Bob's network
produces. Her goal is actually to fuck Bob's grade in the course
because she's a true adversary. So, her adversarial network does
typical
[GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)
things: it has one half to "generate candidates" that the other half
must classify as being real training data or fake training data. Her
GAN departs from the traditional network: her goal is to train an
algorithm capable of interpolation and extrapolation along Bob's
hyperplane. In this way, she can hack Bob's weights at the last minute
(before he submits) and nudge them slightly so that he fails and she
gets the top spot in the class. Yeh, Alice wants to fuck Bob.

understand how her GAN can manipulate Bob's network's theta-weights,
it needs to be able to construct the hyperplane from Bob's trainings
-- assuming he runs the network hundreds of times and she collects the
data. From perturbatation of Bob's stolen theta-weights, Alice's
"Hyperplane-Adversarial-Network" can perturbate those theta-weight
values and attempt to guess the how the total score for the network
will change. Alice has spare time on CERN's supercomputers -- just to
run her algorithm and fuck with Bob. Social justice, n'est-ce pas?

### [A Lack of Irrational, Non-Deterministic Behavior Cripples Your Adversarial Signals Analysis](#a-lack-of-irrational-non-deterministic-behavior-cripples-your-adversarial-signals-analysis)

In almost any context with adversarial signals analysis, a critical
paradox arises: optimally rational inferences about another entity's
behavior requires irrational behavior to *scan* your adversary's
decision structures. Without the proper amount of irrational behavior,
you cannot consistently win these games or retain advantage in any
rational sense.

This is adversarial signals analysis for neural networks. For Alice to
win and to fuck Bob by adversarially manipulating his network -- this
requires irrational, non-deterministic behavior to make assessments of
Bob's network. You must perturbate with injected noise to see how the
adversary's conceptions of hyperplane surfaces will respond. This is
true for artificial neural networks, but also for game-theoretical
inferences about inter-agent dynamics generally.

In doxastic games, to gain the upper hand, you have to be able to
influence the beliefs and decisions of others. Regardless of the
"scoring" mechanics of any games, if there is any formalized
conception between agents, there are three highly effective methods of
influencing the beliefs and decisions of others. These are generally
relevant to all games with doxastic componants -- i.e. all games where
humans or analytical entities are involved.

#### &#9312; Influencing the direction of attention, both individually or collectively

#### &#9313; Influencing, amplifying, falsifying or fabricating information and, thereby, derivative beliefs

#### &#9314; Introspecting the nature of information and decision trees/forests occluded by agent-compartmentalization

Without perturbation and the "rationalizing irrationality", you cannot
effectively engage in the third technique. Without introspecting into
the logistics, processes and decisions of your adversaries in the last
technique, you cannot effectively engage in former two techniques.
Further still, by restricting yourself to purely deterministic or
moreso predictable tactics, then you yourself become more predictable.
From the perspective of a human or analytical entity, the assessment
of another entity's decision making or behavior is exposed as a
feeling. If you're lucky, you'll observe deterministic behavior, but
this is assuming you preemptively know the underlying structures of
your adversaries decision-trees beforehand -- otherwise any probing to
reveal deterministic decision-making will be *baseless*. Further,
assuming that your adversary engages in *at least some irrational
behavior*, then such probing is less fruitful when it assumes purely
deterministic behavior patterns.

![HELOC XAI](/img/posts/2018-12-14-material-conception-of-soul/heloc-xai.jpg)

When the rationalist's additively constructed beliefs render
themselves overly-deterministic, then they not only become more
predictable, but become less capable of predicting the behavior of
others. Perturbation of noise is required to scan the space of your
adversary's decision trees and forests. There are discretized
conceptions of decision trees, but also continuous and/or analytical
conceptions. These are critical for enhancing the performance of
machine learning algoritms. BUT! To make inferences about networks
outside your control in adversarial signals analysis requires:
illogical behavior, non-deterministic behavior, irrational thought.

It is by compelling your adversary to rationalize your
irrationally-motivated behavior that you can compel them to expose
their decision-making processes & structures of incentivization. To
this end, engaging in somewhat irrational behavior beats purely
rational processes. If you only engage in simplistic deterministic
behavior patterns, you will be exposed -- but also, you will not
compel your adversary to expose themselves.

# [The Soul: Your Problem Is The Word](#the-soul-your-problem-is-the-word)

If you don’t define the soul, you can’t say that what I define as the
soul doesn’t exist. You basically don’t like the word. And yes, if you
actually internalize the terms written here and extrapolated from my
argument, it what I’m establishing as a baseline extends to
materialistic pan-psychism.

<a name="the-baseline-and-its-extrapolation-to-panpsychism" />

### [The Baseline and Its Extrapolation to Panpsychism](#the-baseline-and-its-extrapolation-to-panpsychism)

What am I’m setting as the baseline? information representations are
encoded into the physical configuration of matter, but there is no
clear boundary between one physical container of information and
another. therefore, from one biological machine encoding state and
information to every other nearby biological machine, there is a very
grey line between one "container" of information and other life
forms. therefore: panpsychism. but the soul is in the information
ascribed to one individual (or lifeforms) identity as it is
distributed among other nearby (or faraway) lifeforms. However, the
information that defines an individual is not completely contained
within that biological entity. their true self are the disaggregated
shards reflected through society. therefore, my self extends (via our
interactions) into the reflections of my image that exist within you
and are completely out of my control.

Those who become aware of their soul, their true extent of self
outside their brain -- and can exert control over it! -- are far
better adapted to interacting within society than those who cannot,
whether you believe these ideas to be true or not! this is partially
what is so *dangerous* about the *ablation of causality*:
computationally, the problem of knowing these aspects of self
extending into society become increasingly recalcitrant. Even before
considering the introduction of non-physicalized artificial entities
-- because social media and the internet disrupt our perception of
causality -- then it becomes impossible to know the reverberations of
self throughout this material panpsychism. Therefore, it becomes
difficult to distinguish or know one’s identity as it is perceived by
others -- or to know this materally dependent definition of
soul. Hence: the ablation of causality extends to an ablation of
knowledge of self.

Again, if you don’t understand the ideas behind what's written in this
article, then you may not understand Carl Jung. I still have a lot to
learn about his ideas myself, but I at least have imagined the social
precipitation of psychological archetypes. His ideas are profound. I
cannot believe I had not understood psychology and sociology until
now.

overlapping subsets of the last. There is no financial cost without
social consequences. There are no financial or social actions without
informational consequences. Did you bother to think about this or did

Oh boy! I got myself started on the Marxist-Leninists who think their
petty revolutions are anything other than power changing hands from
one social structure to another. The only difference is that their
power structures do not allow for the conservation of value/resource
in financial form, since saving rates plummet in proto/communist
societies. Therefore, people still exchange value in society, but they
end up **bartering with social resources** (i.e. corruption) instead
of being capable of conserving stores of value independent from the

Fuck y’all, I finally learned to life, but *now* y’all want to stop

Solo contendere? This is fine...

[^metaphor-of-platonic-sight]: Sight is not merely visual; given a
    metaphor of the phenomenology of senses explored in Plato's
    Republic, sight can be something you are capable of apprehending,
    so long as it is not occluded. Usually, if your vision is not
    clouded, in time, you can seek to move around occlusions that
    block your sight.

[^biophysics-and-information-representation]: These materially
    dependent forms must reflect, refract, internalize and respond to
    each other, but are compartmentalized into entities or units that
    lack any clear boundary. One such axiom: information about the
    past is never destroyed in physics. Lifeforms and even viruses or
    RNA interact with other biophysical information
    representations. Life evolved increasingly complex methods of
    processing cause and effect -- e.g. mechanisms to detect and
    process optical signals to see. These stimuli gave life the
    ability to internalize and analyze information local to an
    organism's environment, yet there is no clear distinction between
    the signals received as stimulus and the biophysical chain
    reaction leading to the organism's response. Lifeforms began to
    process stimuli to internalize images representing some altered
    images of them, which gives rise to memory, the spatiotemporal
    processing of stimuli and increasingly sophisticated abstractions
    of these images. This extrapolates to pan-psychism.

    After animals had developed social behavior, the appearance of
    information exchange changed, but its underlying biophysical
    mechanics remained the same. Despite the level of a lifeform's
    sophistication there is a critical need to distinguish between
    self and other. Even though plankton, fish, octopi, lizards,
    meerkats and chimps seem to have varying levels of awareness of
    identity, they all share the biophysical mechanics that
    compartmentalize it and react to other entities with
    identities. More ancient forms of life react to the notion of the
    other in purely mechanical means. As life progressed, these images
    of stimuli accumulated references to notions of self and other. If
    it were not so, then a predator could not identify prey or
    recognize cues necessary for reproduction. Even if such cues from
    sensory input are mechanical signals not traditionally understood
    as thought, per se, they are all merely images of information
    transferred in biophysical means. The primary factors
    distinguishing social animals are the modes and bandwidth for
    information processing, regardless of the circumstances,
    dependencies and stability necessary for evolution to produce such
    functionality out of chaos.

    but I couldn't find it on Google Scholar.

[^so-yes-i-know]: So yes, I know exactly what some of you sick fucks
    did to me. Now you want to say i'm dangerous for trying to warn
    other people? Go to hell! Or fucking live in it! Either way,
    humanity is going to fix these fundamental flaws in psychosocial
    dynamics. And social institutions will cease shielding the
    perpetrators.

[^brouwers]: The implications of Brouwer's Translation Theorum for
    mathematical physics are fascinating, although I'm basically
    paraphrasing from a lecture. This theorum is required for most
    work on symplectic manifolds, but it is only applicable in spaces
    and systems with &#9312; A Hamiltonian and &#9313; A Measure of
    Energy. This theorum requires a manifold with `2*n`
    dimensions. When the theorum and its proof are augmented with
    differential forms, it becomes apparent that, in order for all
    looped paths in `R(2*n)` to preserve area, it is necessary for
    relationships that are essentially position and momentum to exist
    between **each** of the `n` planes *and* for those relationships
    to be coherent between **all** of the `n` planes. And this either
    implies or is developed from a definition of conserved energy,
    which is essentially specified by the Hamiltonian.

    As for the the
    metaphysical implications, where are they? Brouwer's Translation
    is required for all symplectic manifolds, but also appears in many
    other areas: both are needed in some applications of Information
    Geometry, though I had far exceeded my level of knowledge once I
    had mentioned symplectic manifolds. The main takeaway is that not
    only do energy, Hamiltonians and these manifolds appear in various
    areas of mathematics, but these concepts are concomitant and
    concurrent to the differential connections between and within
    pairs of planes. The concept of the Hamiltonian is, then,
    primarily one of mathematical physics, as are so many other
    objects developed out of necessity to model physical
    systems. Therefore, physics is firstmost a system of math and math
    is not simply knowledge developed by sentient organisms capable of
    abstract reasoning, as is frequently reaffirmed. Further, this
    translation theorum doesn't work for volumes, only areas. Unless
    there is some equivalent for `R(3*n)`, then all those mechanics in
    the laws of physics that exhibit only position, momentum and
    acceleration -- and never jolt! -- descend from this theorum in
    mathematical physics. That limits the possibilities for conceiving
    worlds with alternative laws of physics.

[^freud-was-a-showboater]: "After they broke up, Freud had big penis
    envy.... Freud was kind of a fraud actually. A real showboater."
    Although, Freud was a true genius, though perhaps not to the same
    degree of Jung.

[^mat-science-playlist]: This playlist on Youtube's
    [matsciencechannel](https://www.youtube.com/user/matsciencechannel)
    is [a fantastic collection of 12
    lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVOpXJZWLC4&list=PLhkiT_RYTEU0jce7u5fJz_S6nOad-58Uk)
    which would probably require me a month to watch, were I to
    extract 12-15% of the content with an understanding of the
    symbolic manipulation of epistemic, doxastic and deontic logic
    with applied game theory. It is unbelievably fascinating and a
    major upgrade to your brain.

[^addressing-anti-semitism]: Greed is an inherently human flaw. Human
    beings -- and truly any consciousness itself, natural or
    artificial -- all suffer the same inherent flaws. They create
    belief systems which are ideal, the later analysis of which may
    state "encouraging sin is sin itself". However, social
    institutions are man-made. These are human flaws that are
    magnified by the games of power -- they were more prevalent in
    Roman society.

    I hate accounting for how my writing will be distorted because to
    shield it from potential distortions, I have to add in all kinds of
    caveats that detract from the overall value when those caveats
    themselves will be used as "proof by unconscious/subconscious
    inclusion". That is, people will point to my anticipated need to
    include statements as some kind of "proof". Would any of those
    people discuss such accusations with me? I would certainly hope so,
    because otherwise it would leave me with no clue that people would
    paint me as anti-semitic while depriving me any ability to defend
    myself. They do not understand the power of my ideas and if my
    philosophic analysis were to be immortalized, would you really want
    the label of anti-semitism to be attached to that? Where do such
    accusations of racism or anti-semitism come from? White middle-class
    leninists who have no respect for the cultural trauma of the people
    they claim to defend.

    Everything in my life is like a doxastic game where I am deprived
    of any ability to change my kafkaesque circumstances. There are
    some tactics in games of belief which are irresponsible -- they
    will create consequences contrary to those which you claim to hold
    sacred. Labeling someone as racist or anti-semitic while depriving
    them of any discussion to defend themselves, should they choose to
    do so, seems to have created the perfect storm of shit in my
    life. This is a tactic people seem to have chosen simply because
    it effectively pushes other people away. In our current decade,
    waging social war against
    entire classes of people, especially if it is to be primarily
    accomplished through the rumor mill, has demonstrated itself as
    not simply dangerous, but childish. Perhaps not the most turbulent
    consequence of such recent attempts at social engineering --
    which have been myopic at best if not clouded by disinformation --
    is that we have mistakenly prioritized creating division at home
    instead of attending to problems of real strategic significance,
    both abroad and at home. Does it *feel* good? Does it *feel* like
    you're accomplishing something? That's the socially engineered,
    disfunctional incentivization at work, which is unintentionally
    creating the domestic stagnation needed for other great powers to
    deconstruct American hegemony.
