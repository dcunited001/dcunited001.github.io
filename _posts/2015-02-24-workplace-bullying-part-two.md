I'm not sure the term **Workplace Bullying** really captures the
essence what happens.  This name *bullying* has too many connotations
attached to it.  It's associated too much with what happens in middle
schools and on playgrounds, making you seem helpless and incapable of
handling your own problems.  While bullying in the workplace is
similar, there are many differences.  Bullying in the workplace is
more methodical, plausible deniability is usually exploited and it's
usually motivated by the bully's fear of being inadequate.
Additionally, workplace bullying involves many strategies and tactics
which aren't inherently harmful or evil in themselves.  Many of these
tactic are necessary for proper management and are invaluable for
leadership.  However, when certain actions are used repetitively with
the wrong intentions, this is when you can begin to argue that you are
being bullied at work.

However, the term "bullying" tends to evoke the wrong imagery and
maybe paints the victim of workplace bullying as being helpless.  For
the most part, bullying in school tends to involve kids who just don't
understand how their behavior is ignorant and extremely
harmful. Bullies in school tend not to be as manipulative; they don't
need to be to avoid being caught and so bullying is less subtle.
Additionally, they aren't motivated by financial incentives.  Both
occur in environments **where the victims are *trapped* to some
degree**; that is, the victims have some obligation to be remain in
the environment.

In general life, if someone mistreats you, you can usually just ignore
or avoid that person.  It becomes much harder if this takes place in
situations where you are required to be.  For example, if you may need
to uproot your family and move in order to find another job.  These
kinds of disasterous consequences can be detrimental on someone's
life.

But it's a serious issue that can have detrimental effects on the
victim's personal relationships and family
life. [Mobbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing) occurs when an
individual is ganged up on in the workplace or in another social
setting.  It's hard to imagine several people agreeing to treat
someone in such a way, but it happens.  There are many instances like
this where this behavior occurs.  But when it does, it's usually the
result of external pressure.  People don't naturally conspire to gang
up on others.  Certain situations in business particularly can provide
the incentives to make this more likely to occur.

#### &#x2605; Before suspected layoffs.  Maybe revenue numbers have mysteriously leaked out of the accounting department.
#### &#x2605; During a merger or organizational restructuring.

> When [mobbing] occurs as emotional abuse in the workplace, such as
> "ganging up" by co-workers, subordinates or superiors, to force
> someone out of the workplace through rumor, innuendo, intimidation,
> humiliation, discrediting, and isolation, it is also referred to as
> malicious, nonsexual, nonracial, general harassment.

But according to the
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing), here's some of the
effects mobbing can have on victims.  Many of these apply to bullying
as well.

> Victims of workplace mobbing frequently suffer from: **adjustment
>disorders, somatic symptoms (e.g., headaches or irritable bowel
>syndrome), psychological trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder and
>major depression.** In mobbing targets with PTSD, Leymann notes that
>the "mental effects were fully comparable with PTSD from war or
>prison camp experiences. Some patients may develop alcoholism or
>other substance abuse disorders. Family relationships routinely
>suffer. Some targets may even develop brief psychotic episodes,
>generally with paranoid symptoms. Leymann estimated that 15% of
>suicides in Sweden could be directly attributed to workplace mobbing.

Think about that for a second:

> ".. somatic symptoms (e.g., headaches or irritable bowel syndrome)"
> ..... as in "They bullied him until he shit himself?"

### I'm tired of being the victim here

And too often, when I complain to my friends and family, they just
tell me to look past it, to ignore it.  They claim I'm paranoid or
looking too deeply into things.  Actually, this isn't terrible advice:
it's important to not get caught up in a bully's games, but sometimes
they're really hard to ignore.  I'm tired of doing nothing.  So, I'm
going to describe exactly how to do this to someone.  This is how it
happens.  Personally, I'm amazed that some poeple are capable of this
or that people could do this at all.

Phillip Perea is a good example of someone who was pushed to the limit
and you can watch
[his Youtube Documentary](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVqAPtyORJk88tBMQzNwDTj00BldZx9V1)
here.  He even has recordings of meetings, where you listen in and see
just how authority figures in his office made unethical, selfishly
motivated decisions.
[Philip Perea](http://nypost.com/2015/01/26/man-shot-outside-news-corp-building-in-nyc/)
also recently commited suicide after career assassination, which is
actually typical after some extreme workplace bullying incidents.  You
can read more below.  Career assassination is covered in the general
strategy "Following Up."  Some bullies will see to it that you never
have another chance again!

## *Incredibly Important!*
#### Please Read!

If you find yourself the victim of some of these strategies, remember
that you may be overthinking things.  Before you can be certain that
someone really is trying to bully you at work, you need to account for
**dozens of examples** of this behavior, implemented as part of a
concerted strategy against you.  If you act prematurely, you'll just
find yourself labelled as paranoid and you'll be easily isolated.

And while this article seems incredibly negative, **I don't want to
give readers the impression** that I view everyone I work with as an
opponent!  This is one of the problems with manipulative, toxic people
like this.  They turn a positive team environment into a living hell
for everyone.  They stir up problems, so they can take advantage of
the chaos later on.  Often, if you're bullied at work, you'll find
that you're not the only one!  And you may also find that, later on,
this person used the circumstances they created in order to gain
power.

<a name="distracting-your-opponent"/>
### &#x2605; [Distract Your Opponent](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#distracting-your-opponent)

The bully will want to make sure that what they do seems justified.
If there are ways of distracting their opponent to prevent them from
completing work, you can bet on it: they will pursue those tactics.

![Keep your eye on the ball](/img/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two/eye-on-ball-1.jpg)

At the end of the game, they need the system to approve everything
they've done.  If management views the bully as someone who pushed out
an employee who didn't accomplish much, the management may actually
favor that person as someone who helped avoid their hands getting
dirty!  So the bully will pursue strategies and distort the
perceptions of those around them to make sure that, after the endgame
plays out, the system will favor everything they did!

In a subsequent part of this series, I'm going to describe ways of
distracting people in software specifically, by abusing bureaucracy,
with fools errand's and through other means.

### &#x2605; [Work Indirecly and Abuse Plausible Deniability](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#abuse-plausible-deniability)

The bully will find multiple explanations for their behavior and get
people to become aware of them, even though they're duplicitous.  This
confuses anyone that might try to stop them.  This person will be
indirect, they will *always* prefer to obscure or to avoid revealing
what they want.  They may distract you by giving away false
motivations.

How do you pick up on this?

### &#x2605; [Crush the Will to Fight Back](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#crush-the-will-to-fight-back)

This person wants to make you give up, so they have control.
Therefore they will want to make you feel the burn.  If they can make
you feel bad or question everything that you do, you're going to be
less able to defend yourself.

![Paris Hilton & the Art of War](/img/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two/paris-hilton.jpg)

<a name="control-the-audience"/>
### &#x2605; [Control the Audience](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#control-the-audience)

This one is used by every workplace bully I know and one of their most
important tactics.  They will seek to control visibility.  They will
react differently to you in front of different people.  They may
chastise you and belittle you in private.  They may ask you to lunch
privately to ask you leading questions.

They will abuse **Carbon Copy** on email.  In other words, they will
leave off your manager when asking for help or asking for your advice
or when congradulating you for a job well done.  Then, they will
**C.C.** their manager when it suits them.

Controlling the audience is usually a coincidence -- most people don't
think of this in this way.  It's important not to jump to conclusions
here.  After all, many times, that's just how the chips fall.  But,
after it happens repeatedly and with strategic purpose, it becomes
hard to ignore.

<a name="isolate-your-enemy"/>
### &#x2605; [Isolate your Enemy](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#isolate-your-enemy)

This may be the most important tactic a workplace bully persues! They
will attempt to isolate you, which is easier if you are quiet and keep
to yourself.

> General word of advice: establish as many authentic relationships
> with colleagues as early as possible.  Help others out, so that when
> you need help, they will be there for you.  Get to know other
> people, so that you establish strong relationships early on.  Don't
> allow one or two relationships to dominate your work life.

You are at a disadvantage in this regard, if you have High Functioning
Autism.  You're the weak link -- maybe not weak in terms of competence
-- but if you haven't played the game right and you haven't
established relationships, then **you're simply the *easiest person to
cut out* from the network.**

> How do they do it?

![Lions Hunting Wildebeasts](/img/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two/lion-hunting.jpg)

#### They chase the pack of animals, which naturally separates the weakest, slowest one.  They isolate this animal and then it's over.

And you will find yourself targeted.  A workplace bully is usually one
who is afraid of being cut out themselves.  In fact, they have honed
these tools as a response to being cut out from previous
opportunities, for competence.  **But where they do excel is
manipulation.** This is perhaps the most frustrating part: these
people excel in constructing contrived circumstances that **make
people at your office unhappy!** They may appear useful, but it's
usually because they take credit for other people's work.

Managers: **Visibility, *Visibility, VISIBILITY!* ** Do not allow one
person to construct your perspective of your office's environment and
culture!

### &#x2605; [Use the System to Avoid Blame](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#use-the-system-to-avoid-blame) -- "Those are the Rules! Sorry, not my fault!"

This person excels at operating within the system.  Contrary to
popular misconceptions, many sociopaths are actually great at playing
by the rules and obeying laws.  In fact, they excel at using the
system against people.  A workplace bully will construct contrived
situations where you are publicly humiliated by the system.

<a name="losing-the-game-play-a-new-game"/>
### &#x2605; [Losing the Game? Play a New Game!](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#losing-the-game-play-a-new-game)

The rules don't favor the bully? The bully will find ways to implement
new rules that do.  This person will use the system to construct a box
around you.  Likely, they will avoid calling someone out on these new
rules until you are fully trapped.

Examples of this behavior include complaining to management about
minor problems.  Acting like certain situations are unfair.  They do
this one on one with a manager, out of sight.  The manager then
responds as they should, by enforcing a policy which seems fair.  But
really, the workplace bully is just trying to trap you by setting up a
game where you will fail.

> "But he comes in an hour late every day!"

... yeh, I also stayed an hour late every day.  Big fucking deal.  I'm
a programmer -- good programmers eliminate time.

### &#x2605; [Catspaws, Catspaws, Catspaws](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#catspaws-catspaws-catspaws)

The bully will attempt to get other people to do the dirty work.  This
is very complicated, since you have to construct abstracted behavior
to pass to other people, often using suggestion and manipulation.  I
honestly don't get how people do it.

This is usually harder to achieve and requires someone who is
particularly manipulative.  Therefore, you won't tend to see this
happening, unless multiple people gang up on you at work -- which is
called **mobbing** by the way.

![Cat's Paw](/img/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two/catspaw.jpg)

#### Nyan!

It seems to be easier if you excel at math, especially category
theory, since you are technically obfuscating functions in a manner
such that the behavior you intend will be executed by someone else.

Oh, but when a catspaw is caught?  Well then, it's on them, isn't it?
Oftentimes, when a catspaw is caught in the act, a bully will use this
as a reason to push that person out -- and thus, that person is no
longer a threat to the bully.

<a name="control-your-environment-and-limit-the-options"/>
### &#x2605; [Control your environment and Limit the Options](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#control-your-environment-and-limit-the-options)

This is another gem from Sun Tzu's art of war: limit the opponent to
playing from the cards in your hand.  Besides using suggestion, the
bully in this case would really need to be a manager in order to get
this to work. And then, it's really hard to question, isn't it --
after all, that person is your manager.

<a name="let-your-opponent-destroy-themselves"/>
### &#x2605; [Let your Opponent Destroy Themselves](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#let-your-opponent-destroy-themselves)

This is a vital one and one that doesn't necessarily indicate a
workplace bully.  Just like the principle behind using catspaws, you
don't want to get your hand caught in the fire.

In business, this is often known as *giving someone enough rope to
hang themselves.* If you find yourself in a position at work where
things seem to be going really badly and then suddenly, you're solely
entrusted with a major project and all then tensions seem to vanish --
this is probably because you're about to get fired!

If that is the case, then this is probably your last week.  This is
the straw that breaks the camel's back and this major new
responsibility is one where you're intended to fail.  For example, you
may reach out to your coworkers, who don't efficiently or honestly
answer your questions.  Congratulations, you've just found yourself
hung out to dry.

However, workplace bullies will time after time, set up a game where
the victim is intended to lose.  This is setting someone up for
failure and, depending on the degree of failure you intend, could
really be a business sin.

But it really depends on the intention behind the act: did you really
intend to set someone up for failure?  Or is that just how it played
out?  Either way, it's your fault: you shouldn't entrust someone who
isn't ready with major responsibilities.

<a name="applying-labels-and-abusing-them"/>
### &#x2605; [Applying Labels and Abusing Them](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#applying-labels-and-abusing-them)

The workplace bully, early on, will attempt to psychologically profile
you.  They will ask you questions that will allow them to label you
and place you in a neat little box that makes it easy to manipulate
you.  They will be especially prone to asking questions about your
lifestyle and especially your age.  I have found, time and time again,
that one of the first things a workplace bully does is asks my
age. Every. Single. Time!

Now, normally, these are just questions which happen to come up.  When
people want to get to know each other, these are they questions they
ask:
- Are you single, dating or married? Do you have kids?
- How old are you?  Where are you from?
- Do you drink?  Do you smoke?  Do you smoke ... weed?  Ok, that last
  one doesn't normally come up very early.
- I heard you were *libertarian* ... is that true?  (they probably
  won't ask this directly, but they will label you with it)

See, but that's the problem right there: **plausible deniability.**
Remember that? These are just questions people ask to get to know each
other -- **forget about whether or not you are even legally allowed to
ask some of these questions!** You will feel compelled to answer them
because you want to get to know these people and aren't they nice.
You may also feel compelled to *not ask the same questions, since it's
not workplace appropriate.* This leaves you at a disadvantage!

Nine out of ten people asking these questions are not harboring any
ill will!  In fact, you may offend them by not answering!  *But you're
better off if you don't!* Don't be rude of course.  You're better off
finding a polite way to evade the question.  Ugh, this sounds bad,
since you really do want to get to know people at work.  I don't know
what the right answer is here, but I have had labels attached to me
*and I have had them used against me!!*

![Abusing Labels](/img/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two/labels.jpg)

Why are you better off not answering, and especially to a sociopathic
workplace bully? Because that one in ten is going to use your answers
to label you and limit your possible behaviors in their social model
of you.  This person may not need to ask the questions if other people
do it for them.

> Remember, sociopaths have no morals.  They have no conscience that
> tells them not to do unethical things.  I almost feel sorry for
> them.  **The best mechanism for limiting their behavior is making
> others aware of it.** Here's one of those tools I was telling you
> about in Part One: ** *make others aware. * **

- **Just twenty-five years old?** 'How could this person 20 years
  younger than me possibly have the experience required!  I'll show
  them!'
- **Married with kids?** 'Probably not likely to be an alcoholic who
  stays out late. Or maybe .. with just the right push, I can
  manipulate this person into having some relationship issues. Not
  going to be getting much work done then.'
- **Married with older kids?** 'How's your relationship going?  How
  are your kids doing?  Are there any buttons here I can push to make
  you mad?'
- **Smokes Weed?** 'Probably smokes crack too.  Who knows?  Does he
  need a security clearance?  Can we *really* trust a **drug
  addict**?'
- **Far Right/Left Politics** 'Maybe I can create contrived
  circumstances to play him against the guy in the office with
  opposite politics.'

Out of all of these ageism is the most subtle, IMO.  When you're
young, it doesn't really seem to be that much of a problem.  Who
cares?  While, I haven't experienced a work environment as someone in
their 50's or 60's, I do know that telling someone your age when you
are in your early twenties can put you at a disadvantage.  A workplace
bully will be moreso enabled to critique your work experience and
resume -- and they won't do that in front of you!

It's also important to note that older people have experienced more in
their careers.  They can provide a wealth of experience to you, which
you should definitely draw upon.  Listen to these people. They've
likely been through a lot and, like I mentioned in Part One, "Fools
learn from their experiences -- while the wise learn from history."
**Me? I was the *fool*.**

As a double-edged sword, it's exactly this experience that enables
them to be more manipulative!  I'm not trying to say that older people
are manipulative, I'm saying that some people who have acquired enough
experience have the ability to manipulate.  Out of the four or five
workplace bullies I have personally experienced, all of them were in
there mid-thirties or older.  However, I'm assuming that if someone is
younger than this and ends up being a workplace bully, then they are
likely narcissistic and likely to be particularly bad, as they would
have to naturally act in this manner.  Either that, or they have grown
up with extremely manipulative role models -- and if so, watch out!

<a name="finding-your-buttons-and-pushing-them"/>
### &#x2605; [Finding Your Buttons and Pushing Them](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#finding-your-buttons-and-pushing-them)

Bullies will use these labels to help determine your behavior.  They
will be more capable of effectively manipulating you and getting away
with it.  The goal in game theory is to limit your opponents behavior
to a more predictable model.

> Word of advice: ** *Do not let yourself become predictable.* ** You
> are much more easily manipulated when someone can predict your
> actions.

![Stop Button](/img/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two/pushing-buttons.jpg)

Religion and Psychological Labels are like roadmaps to manipulating
people.  In my experience, every workplace bully that I have dealt
with excelled in psychologically assessing someone.  Or ... at least
maybe they thought they did.

- **High Functioning Autism?** 'Probably susceptible to distraction
  with auditory/visual stimulus.  Probably easily distractable,
  suggestable, easy to lead on, and easy to make them emotional.'
- **Christian?** 'Well, this guy is supposed to forgive & forget and
  turn the other cheek.  And he also won't do X, Y, or Z.'
- **Mormon?** 'This guy probably won't drink alcohol.  Might not even
  drink caffeine.'
- **Buddhist?** 'Hmmmm... he's not even supposed to want anything.  He
  probably loves everything.  This guy will probably ignore everything
  I do to him.  *Perfect*.'

Some people will take labels and they will use them.  Of course,
people sometimes want to identify labels out of respect and don't
intend harm.  You're probably not going to ask a Jewish guy if he
wants some of your sushi.  That'd imply that you didn't know him very
well and could be disrespectful.  But *sometimes* -- and this applies
to religious labels especially -- people will use these as models to
predict your behavior and use it against you.  They will test you a
bit, to see that you'll consistently act with the model they expect.
And then they'll use the model to exploit you.

![Pulling Strings](/img/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two/pulling-strings.jpeg)

Respect someone's religion and politics if they share them with you.
You need to accept it, understand it and appreciate it, but definitely
do not use it against someone for Christ's sake!  Most people, even if
they are a workplace bully, will not use religion.  However, a true
sociopath will not hesitate, so long as they don't get caught!

> Leave Religion and Politics at Home -- For Your Own Sake!

Additionally, as this person begins to model your behavior more and
more, they will begin to understand just how to push your buttons to
get you to react in the way they want. They may push your buttons in
private, 1-on-1, before a meeting.  Then, they will act surprised when
you lash back at them in front of everyone.  They will push your
buttons to shift blame and make it seem like you're the bad guy.

<a name="gradually-eat-away-at-reputation"/>
### &#x2605; [Gradually Eat Away at Reputation](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#gradually-eat-away-at-reputation)

A workplace bully will make smart comments in meetings and poke fun at
you in front of other colleagues.  While they may belittle you 1-on-1
as well, this will take place in front of other people or via email.
They will find ways to whittle down your reputation.

Make no mistake -- this is not "just poking fun." This is part of a
concerted strategy to reduce your collegue's confidence in you.  The
workplace bully is attempting to control others' perceptions of you.
If you let this go on, you will find yourself entrusted with less and
less responsibilities.  With less responsibilities, you will find
yourself claiming less contributions to the team's work!

<a name="convince-people-that-the-ends-justifies-the-means"/>
### &#x2605; [Convince People that the Ends Justifies the Means](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#convince-people-that-the-ends-justifies-the-means)

Eventually, once this person has successfully rooted themselves in
your environment, destroyed your colleagues' confidence in you and
smeared your reputation, they will begin convincing others that
removing you is for the best.  You're useless anyways, since you don't
contribute -- you've had your responsibilities limited, your tasks for
work severely limited and, thus, your contributions are limited as
well -- so the best thing for everyone is to get rid of you.

If the bully has this much influence over your environment, then at
this point, the bully will be able to remove you fairly easily.  They
will be able to convince your colleagues to start acting against you.
They will push your buttons more and more, just to point and say --
see? I told you so!

<a name="eliminate-threats-early"/>
### &#x2605; [Eliminate Threats Early](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#eliminate-threats-early)

A workplace bully will tend to try to eliminate threats early, before
a perceived problem becomes a threat.  If you stand up for yourself or
sidestep their tricks & charades, you will quickly find yourself a
target.  So watch out!

<a name="following-up-crushing-an-enemy-totally"/>
### &#x2605; [Following Up -- Crushing an Enemy Totally](/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two.html#following-up-crushing-an-enemy-totally)

Some workplace bullies are particularly vindictive.  They will work
hard to make sure you are never given another chance again. Or that,
at least, you won't be close to them or anyone they know.  They don't
want other people hearing about the dirty tricks up their sleeve.
This is discussed in 48 Laws of Power --

![Das Brennende Troja](/img/posts/2015-02-24-workplace-bullying-part-two/das-brennende-troja.jpg)

#### The Trojan War -- Golden Apples, Pwnies, Salted Earth, and More

By the way, Troy has nothing to do with this.  I'm mostly referring to
the fact that after the Trojan War, the greeks salted the earth around
Troy, so nothing would ever grow there again.  In other words, they
totally crushed there enemy.  People have been doing this for
thousands of years -- but, honestly, if you're not fighting a war, you
should probably lay the !@#$ off.

Before the workplace bully finishes you off, they may place you in a
position, where they subtly let you know that they want you to leave
-- and if you don't you will face retribution down the line.  WATCH
OUT!  It's a trick!  This person is going to dispense retribution
regardless of what you do.  And really, they are just trying to take
advantage of you in a demoralized state.  The earlier they push you
out, the less dirty tricks they'll have to reveal and use.  ** *And
once you're gone,* there's not much you can do to defend yourself!!**

The bully will attempt to close all doors leading back to them.  Even
after they defeat you, a wise enemy will still continue to work to
affect your life.  They may not deal with you personally, they may
separate themself from threats by using catspaws and continually
"isolating" you by assaulting your reputation.  This means that fewer
people will get closer to you.  Eventually, everyone will forget your
accomplishments. History is written by the victors, remember?  And the
workplace bully will work to make you seem as though you are nothing
or worse -- crazy.

You will likely be pushed out and provided severance.  This severance
will come accompanied by a gag order, a non-disparagement clause.
This is to be expected and, in itself, is fair.  However, if you've
recently moved to a new area and have significant bills, this is
basically the equivalent of handing you a week or two of pay, which
you will take because otherwise you'd be homeless.  And the effect is
such that you will never be able to honestly talk about what happened
to you at work!  You may be distraught and emotionally incapable of
handling what happened -- but you can't talk about it!.  Legally, you
can't even discuss it with a psychologist!

A particularly vindictive bully with lots of connections will keep
tabs on your social media presence.  They won't want you to become too
successful.  If you move to a new area and they have connections
there, they may attempt to link you up, but they will poison their
connections against you first.  They won't want to get caught doing
this though.

They may even indirectly try to drive you to suicide.  No, I'm
serious.  The FBI tried to do it to MLK jr.  So, if there is
documented evidence of a government agency doing it, is it really that
far out there?  Most people have at least enough conscience to dread
even thinking about this -- therefore, this doesn't happen very often.
But some people are only motivated by what others see.

And after all, if you are no longer around, you no control control
over your legacy.  The bully then has much more control over your life
and your history.  And there's not a damn thing you can do about it!
If they can manipulate while you can defend, they can manipulate when
when you're dead.

as other tools you can use to protect yourself.
