# [A Spectral Theory of Information](#a-spectral-theory-of-information)

A critical idea for understanding sociological dynamics, generally and
especially in the 21st century, is **spectral information
theory**. Without it, you can't make predictions about trends on
social media. You can't even understand the causal implications of
your own actions in our technocracy.

It essentially provides a spectrogram for information, where
individual instantiations of information are frequencies and their
amplitudes correspond to their prevelance. One way to explain it to
children is "What's your favorite word? What do you think your
friend's favorite words are? What do you think the class's favorite
word is?" -- that's not so complicated, is it? Put away your crayons
and your liberal arts degree(s), this is the stuff marketing and
communications is made of, folks. With advances in computation and
analysis, it's about to become cold, hard science.

### [The Era of the Subjective is Coming to an End](#the-era-of-the-subjective-is-coming-to-an-end)

We will discover that the capacity for subjectivity evaporates as our
collective computational prowess expands. That's right:
post-modernists be damned, subjectivity has always been a fleeting
illusion. The good [old] news is that the bars of your newfound
structuralist prison are reigned in by limitations imposed by
computational complexity and free-energy. The degree by which the
potential for subjectivity is mediated is a problem of social
engineering and metamodernism: to balance the energy requirements of
computation with the needs of society for the realized
phenomenological benefits for efficient computation, society must
adapt itself informationally. Language, knowledge and other cultural
artifacts need to be architected to maximize the benefits of
computation. Without cheaply indexed language and culture, humanity
depletes itself of energy without gaining phenomenologically
significant returns on technology.[^caelis-ruissant]

- include information from #3.a and #3.b

  - This conceptualization for information crosses into the territory
    of music theory! ... mapping
    information in terms of *tones* and *information chords* that
    correspond to times-series emissions of patterns of cliques via
    algebraic graph theory. The graph-theoretic structures can be
    mapped to an over-arching, all-encompassing ontological structure
    of generalized information-geometric tones & chords. A universal
    language should be based on this ontological structure -- and
    recursively analyzing the overlap between semantic mappings of
    language pairs should provide insight into the structure of this
    global generalized ontological structure.

### [調: Acknowledgement of the Spectral in Eastern Languages](#acknowldgement-of-the-spectral-in-eastern-languages)

In Japanese, the concept of 調 (chou) means both *investigate* and
*tone*. The symbol 調 is used in words that represent "condition;
state of affairs", "investigation" and "auditory tone".  At first
glance, this seems counterintuitive -- but when you investigate, you
seek to ask questions that indicate the amplitude of informational
tones. 調 is composed of the symbol 周 (circumference), modified by
the radical 言 (say, word). If you wanted to see how far across the
social graph information had spread, how would you identify where to
look and how broadly? You would probably investigate.

**Choushi wa dou?** means, loosely "what's going on?". Other
derivations from 調 more clearly imply the combined denotative
*semantic tones* from 調: investigate (information acquisition) and
tone.

#### 調和: Harmony

#### 調査: Investigation

#### 調合: Compounding or Dispensing a Medicine

#### 調子外れ: Discord

#### 調律: Musical Tuning

#### 調味: Seasoning (literally tone-flavor) -- with connections to 意味 (literally idea-flavor)

#### 調号: Musical Key Signature

#### 調波: Harmonic (wave)

#### 調声: Tonal Mark (viz. Pinyin)

#### 調べ直す: To Re-examine or Reassess

#### 調心輪: An Aligning Ring, which guides a piston's motion to stabalize its timing in an engine

#### 調べ合わす: To Tune To or To Check Against

Other interesting words in the same semantic vain can be delineated
from the characther 曲's connection to both music and curvature. where
線 simply means line, the combined 曲線 means curve.

###

In the west conceptualizing in terms of the spectral is almost
entirely relegated to the obscurantism of the occult, native speakers
of eastern languages get these concepts for free -- no initiation
required! While the semantics of many of the same concepts do appear
in Western languages, they appear in idioms, in myths or in forgotten
aspects of etymological evolution. The Han Dynasty's writing system,
which propagated from Middle China to Japan and Korea, slowed
linguistic evolution in the Far East by binding morphemes

You can see how the practices of Shinto and Taoism openly deal with
managing the spectral content of information. Though it might be
sacrilegious, if one were to run computational linguistic analysis on
Ema tablets, you would produce spectral insights into the collective
desires of the community served by the shrine.

#### Ema Tablets[^tokyo-ravens] Hang In A Shinto Shrine

> Religious practices have been adapted to fill critical social
> functions. Here, information is being collected about what people

![](/img/posts/2019-03-05-disnormalization/ema-tablets.jpg)

The practice of hanging and burning Ema tablets facilitates an
exchange of information that helps priests and religious organizations
tune into the needs of their community. Christianity has similar
practices -- dedicational prayers, devotionals, or even confessions --
where the [teleonomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleonomy) niche
fulfilled is to facilitate informational exchange critical to serving
the community or to orient individuals to be receptive to change.

<a name="wat-you-mad-bro" />

### [Wat? You Mad Bro?](#wat-you-mad-bro)

In the West, you practically need to sell your firstborn to the
Illuminati or your soul to the Masons to operate with these
concepts. It is forbidden knowledge and, albeit cryptically, the
impact that the spectral has on western societies is covered in the
book [The Law is a White Dog](). Accumulating "informational taint" by
one's actions or social associations ...

In the west, the consequences of association with tainted individuals
range from mildly burdening your reputation to all-out [Corruption of
Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attainder) in the
extreme. Corruption of Blood, in its legal implementation, is a
practice associated with attainder, but as it and other forms of
attainder can occur implicitly or as a consequence of a sociophysical
program, it is not strictly dependent on a legal mechanism. The Law is
a White Dog deals with the spectral consequences of accumulation and
diffusion of taint in society -- in America, the Constitutional
provisions prohibiting Bills of Attainder have been circumvented by
secret law and secret precedent, as well as the prohibitions of Cruel
and Unusual Punishment.

Secret law itself seems carried out by occult traditions and is
thereby extra-legal: you are never nominally punished, but are
subjected to "extra" helpings of legal process until whatever shadowy
forces behind the scene that direct law and "order" see that society
at large believes that the individual's punishment has been meted out
fairly. Nothing will be left of the individual's social memory, except
ghost stories. If [the extralegal bullshit that happened to me in this
case](https://github.com/dcunited001/bb8) had been pulled off, I would
never be able to receive a Visa to live in Japan. Do these people
care? No. It is a foregone conclusion to them that my life is already
and always will be *forfeit*. Forfeit to what? I don't even know.

The same mechanisms by which these spectral processes proceed are nigh
verboten for open discussion in the West, but so commonly understood
in the East that they have been encoded into the semiotic and semantic
structures of the Han Dynasty's written language for over two thousand
years. Why? Because the individual is sacred in the West and the
collective is enshrined in the East. Again, why?  Because the West was
always reacting, economically and sociopolitically, to developments
occuring in the East. To congeal to a sociopolitical collective was to
conform to dynamics with causal momentum set in motion by the
East. Why? In addition to the geoeconomic distribution of resources
and commerce, it is because the day begins in the East and the causal
implications of economic or sociopolitical events ripple westward,
giving the East an timelessly insurmountable advantage for proactively
driving dynamics the West would respond to. This advantage has
subsided in the modern era, but the impacts to the evolution of
language and especially philosophic thought will never be erased.

- Useful as an ontological structure that algebraically provides a set
  of generalized statistical models, which may be used to analytically
  approximate any statistical system -- regardless of tensor rank,
  which is increased by every algebraically irreducible direct sum.
- Similar to the algebraic structures describing convexity in high
  dimensions or enumerations relevant to Gaussian curvature.
- Does the difference between norms (as distribution) and beliefs
  about them provide a basis for descent using fisher metric to find
  the infogeometric analytic structure(s) that generate(s) the
  perceived norm.
- The superposition of analytic structures (direct summation) that
  represent the mapping of function spaces may be possible to infer
  from the infogeometric results. This superposition (imprinted or
  implied) may correspond to some algebra on hilbert spaces.
- Normalization is like adversarial optimal transport (as a game)
- Extrapolation is easier when common belief has greater social spread
  and more complete consensus (in epistemic domains relevant to
  propositions or some game) — the more epistemic similarity and
  infogeometric overlap, the more resonance perceived by those
  operating within the system.

#### The Obligatory Brueghel Tower of Babel

![Brueghel Tower of Babel](/img/posts/2019-03-05-disnormalization/brueghel-tower-of-babel.jpg)

Norms from different areas of life -- psychological, social, cultural,
legal and epistemic -- can all be seen through a unified lens. Hence,
regardless of how well-structured, ephemeral or
[holonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) norms are,
they can all be reasoned about within the same frame of reference.
Herein, norms are delineated and stratified in order of the rigidity
and/or clarity of their structure. A state of disnormalization can
result in systems that introduces a new phase of normative evolution:
norms evolve faster, novel system dynamics emerge, expectations about
behavior or system trajectory become impotent if even
accurate. Arising from the harmony or discord of the spectral harmony
of *common belief* causes extrapolation of system or group trajectory
to become unclear. Once specific sets of sociocultural norms become
spectrally disharmonious, sociophysical systems become less
predictable and thus, information itself becomes less useful than
action, power, credibility or potentials thereof.

- emphasize disnormalization's disruption to language, non-verbal
  communication and parsing meaning from action/symbols.

- define denormalization, as it applies herein, as a process between
  normalized and disnormalized. define disnormalization as it applies
  variously in the contexts of individual psychology, sociocultural
  settings, etc as a **state of dissociation from norms.**
  - because of the singularity's accelerating sociocultural
    destabalization, absent some artificial forces of normalization,
    society will continue to become destructured.


For systems whose mechanics include norms, a state of global
dysregulation results when:

#### &#9312; There is disrupted normative consensus: distributions corresponding to norms typically produce few distinct local maximums.

#### &#9313; There is disrupted normative evolution: (...)

#### &#9314; Systemically, there is difficulty in finding (overlap) in higher-order normative structures (i.e. in beliefs about norms or epistemic structures derived from a distribution corresponding to a norm)

#### &#9315; There are spectral aspects of epistemic components of norms, which may become disharmonic -- i.e. the epistemic components tend to become noise.

From the dysregulated system's normative mechanics, novel dynamics and
accelerated evolution emerge. Usually, a system in a disnormalized
state accelerates evolution of norms and corresponding
socioinformational structures, until the advantageous sociocultural
adaptations replicate and the system again becomes harmonized in a new
equilibrium. This is an equilibrium of the system's normative
mechanics and is related to the rates of normative evolution,
replication and consensus.

### (Ising)

This is most easily understood by visual metaphor, so imagine
measuring the amount of order or disorder in [this 2D Ising
Simulation](https://mattbierbaum.github.io/ising.js/). If you increase
the temperature, the apparent disorder increases, as does the
entropy. Decrease the temperature and local particle states are more
likely to become dependent on adjacent particle states. Check the link
to visually grok the "phase transitions" induced via the tug of war
between order and entropy. The phase transitions here are a
generalization of solid, liquid, gas and plasma. Various interaction
dynamics (both particle and group) become dominant while specific
phases are active -- in the local social graph neighborhood for a
socioinformational Ising simulation.

#### Quantitatively measuring sophistication of order in Ising simulations is not simply a product of my imagination:

When potential information exchanges are restricted by physical space,
this almost completely filters out edges in the social graph. In this
way, the bars and walls of prison act to constrain the potential
social interactions for inmates. When potential social interactions
emerge in limited physical proximity only, then it becomes plain to
see how Ising models are useful for social physics: state changes can
only occur locally. In sociophysical simulations, state changes would
include informational updates -- instead of interacting spins of
adjacent particles causing local dynamics and phase changes, you have
the mechanics of interacting informational states influencing adjacent
social particles.

Now, remove the physical constraints and instead consider
hyperconnected networks and consider the speed at which thought
travels in the modern world to both be coupled to a generalized
temperature that describes rate of information in a sociophysical
system. In physical systems information is correlated to the rate of
potential particle interactions. Disnormalization should normally
accompany an increase the value for this specific definition of a
generalized temperature. When a new equilibrium of normative evolution
is reached, disnormalization is scaled back and the sociophysical
system's particles are more entangled. Though likely unrelated to the
mechanics of entanglement of physical systems, the mechanics of norms
seem to mimic quantum entanglement in many ways. The connection
between norms in sociophysical systems and quantum mechanics is
*shallow*: primarily, many particles take on values that they expect
other particles take on and particles each conceptualize *normal*
behavior by forming statistical distributions from their experience.

For social organisms within a sociophysical system, their individuals
are much more capable of reasoning about the group collectively and
extrapolating to reason about possible futures if they are
well-ordered social organisms. Still, homogeny is the mother of
weakness and total order means limited variance halts evolutionary
mechanisms, eventually yielding a social organism easily out-competed
by its neighbors. With too much disorder, it is impossible for an
individual in a social organism to make expectations about group
behavior in the future. In this state of disnormalization, there are
no certainties except the stagnation of meaningless change. If
individuals are called to act as a group, they cannot know how to call
the entire group to action. Eventually, a state of disnormalization
either results in a new equilibrium or a mitotic division into
multiple social organisms each seeking normative equilibrium.

What Ansatz structures are useful for sociophysical simulation? How
can these Ansatz structures be transformed into quantum circuits? How
can these circuits facilitate computation necessary for sociophysical
calculation or simulation? How effective will quantum computing be at
predicting social interaction?

### But What If Norms With Widely Distributed Social Consensus Are Rare?

Disnormalization describes a sociocultural phenomena where it becomes
more normal for ideas to resist normification. As humanity approaches
the singularity, technology will begin to evolve faster than we can
culturally adjust to it. Determining what is considered normal is
necessary in the deontic logic of legal argumentation involving the
[reasonable person](). For socioinformational systems where
disnormatization is prevalent: norms either manifest slowly, resist
social consensus or are not formed in time to be relevant.
Disnormatization is not about the formation, development or
obselescence of individual norms. Instead, it concerns dynamics of
norms within some realm, including legal, social or linguistic
spheres. Is the system in such a state where it is reasonable to
expect that norms will coalesce naturally as a product of social
interaction? Particularly, does some system, realm or social network
generally exhibit social consensus on norms?

When the phenomenon of disnormalization becomes prevelant in some
sphere, this implies that either &#9312; the social experiences which
tend to cause individuals to perceive norms no longer facilitate the
conception of norms or &#9313; the distribution of information about
norms is impaired. Both may occur when speciation of information
around which individual norms would be formed becomes too complex:
that is, the nature of each individual's experiences are so distinct
that there aren't enough common traits or patterns of experience upon
which to reason about other individual's experiences. The difficulty
of validating one's own perception of norms from within the skew of a
filter bubble is one technological mechanism that potential
contributes to disnormalization.

Norms enable entities in sociophysical settings to collaborate
objectively by promoting correspondance in perceived epistemic
strucutures. In settings where the consequences of actions may induce
turbulence that results wide ranging or negative impacts to economic,
political and other realms, entites seek normative approaches to
promote harmony. Though when the status quo imposes disadvantageous or
disastrous implications for entities and thus, they are incentivized
to disrupt the status quo. They do so by leveraging the degree of
consensus and epistemic correspondance. This vastly coalesces
certainty and confidence in statistical models, reducing the spatial
and temporal complexity of games.

# Consensus in Legal Norms

The process of consensus in legal norms provides a simplified approach
to understanding a unified model of norms as structures of
disaggregable distributions with associated epistemic structures. The
epistemics are codified into law with clearly denoted
language. Precedent and other discourse enable quantified analysis of
how these epistemic structures adapt to the influence of a
well-organized web of actors, whose numbers scale in models far better
than other sociophysical settings. The utility of legal norms is
magnifed by their degree of consensus and stability, the impact of
which greatly influence expectation and planning in business,
economics, politics, international relations and society at all
levels. Therefore, legal norms reach further levels of clarity and
consensus than other more ephemerally structured social norms and
legal norms.

Legal norms are particularly useful in that it is simple
to reason about them in the objective sense. Their structure is so
well defined that AI in the form of analytic machines may datamine
court records to identify patterns of deviation from legal norms. This
can identify cases where sentencing decisions were too harsh,
considering the judge's reasoning behind previous rulings. Precedent
establishes norms that can be delineated into plain language, *whereby
legal staff can collectively collaborate* to develop rhetoric or to
strategically sieve away the disadvantageous space of
argumentation. The latter refers to tactics including influencing what
a judge determines as
["holding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_(law)) for a case or
distorting the set of precedent & case history that would sift a case
towards or away from rendering legal norms relevant for consideration.

Distinguishing the objectivity and well-structuredness of legal norms
from other norms, legal staff can cooperate to collaborate on what
norms have been established through precedent. This collection of
information must be considered relevant to anticipate how the judge
will make determinations. It can be said that decisions or suggestions
in legal strategy are *correct or incorrect, in a definitive manner*.
Such issues may also be undecidable, but this objectivity is scarce
for social norms.

In common law, establishing precedent systematically affects future
judicial decisions and it is hereby that actors in common law systems
may extrapolate the diffeomorphic boundary of legal norms and legal
precedent -- this is the boundary of change in common law
systems. When the cases along this diffeomorphic boundary have some
novel epistemic configuration of information (with nuanced relation to
existing legal norms), this results in some issue as-yet-undecided by
current case law -- as well as an article in your favorite (...)

- In H-ILJ, it is primarily the lack of a definitive supreme authority
  (along with a confluence of other complex factors) that results in
  the “uncertainties of epistemology” in international law
  implementation that require its reliance on legal norms.

> “... thus the power to determine the exact content of that norm most
> often lies not with any international body, but with sovereign
> states themselves (who will often disagree with each other)”

- Hence, the enforceability, the likelihood of action on norms, etc
  ... relies on the spread of a norm’s distribution. The less clear
  the polarization that is exhibited among parties contesting some
  norm, given the Clausewitz definition of polarization applied to
  those parties’ interpretation of it, the less likely there is to be
  action. That is, if disparity among a norm’s interpretation occurs,
  it’s corresponding multi-variate distribution may either spread out
  over a large area of variables or be contained tightly. If there is
  no disparity, the Dirac delta function occurs and the distribution’s
  volume singularizes under one point. If the distribution
  singularizes under two points, given all actors’ interpretations,
  then you have maximal bipolarity spread across two opposing
  camps. The degree of correlation and contention amongst the
  epistemic content of each parties’... (establishes) the magnitude of
  disparity which may result in conflict. However, as these maximal
  special cases of volume distribution break down and norms become
  distributed over larger regions of their variables, the potential
  arises for actors to be clustered over larger regions. Even though
  these clusters may exhibit strong inter-cluster polarization, the
  way each clusters’ actors spread over larger regions results in
  reduced compulsion for resolution and more epistemically
  uncertainty. This applies to social norms as well. However, the
  implications to epistemic uncertainty of norms (and the variables
  whereby they may be parameterized or disaggregated) change as: the
  number of actors scales up, the norms epistemic structure break
  down, and the definition of actor becomes less rigidly structured —
  the last of which is why the definition of sovereignty to Int’l
  Legal Realism is critical.

Clausewitz (chapter one, section 15, on polarity)
- (briefly explain this point, perhaps in footnote)
- this section’s definition of polarity in sociophysical systems
  (perhaps quantified by some data science component) holds when
  Brouwer’s fixpoint theorem holds. When a Brouwer translation is
  necessary, the principle of polarity breaks down. This is
  essentially equivalent to the last sentence of section 15.

- TODO: how will disnormalization affect international relations?
  - impacts to sociocultural & domestic political norms will tend to
    cause many of the issues hinted at in this article from [Harvard
    ILJ](http://www.harvardilj.org/wp-content/uploads/HLI204_crop.pdf)
    - e.g. breakdown of rationality and well-definedness of states due
      to turbulent cultural/political situations ... it's
      sociocultural disnormalization that leads to a contentious
      situation where [ideological] conflict over norms is
      necessary/possible.

- The Tower of Babel, whether true, false, mythological or incomplete,
  is a story about the dysregulation of meaning in language until a

  - In the long-term, this challenges the established the networks of
    semantic meaning corresponding to morphemes. Also, wherever there
    is a grammar, there is the potential to create “shadow grammars”
    where alternative grammatical parsing is implied to the listener
    via abnormal inflection or intonation.

=======

- projecting/receiving belief about norms is a social process that
  helps harmonize perceived normative distritions by accelerating
  social consensus of belief about norms.
  - Reasoning about the perceived belief about norms helps someone
    conform.
  - If they are isolated from observing stimulus which project
    belief about norm and/or facilitate its consensus -- and there is
    more than bidirectional signaling at play -- then this accelerates
    their own piagetian changes in internal epistemic structure. in
    the absence of social stimuli, one's own experience and thoughts
    have more impact on their evolution in cognitive structuring,
    sub/conscious direction of attention and abstraction.
  - Also, you're receiving less information about changes in group
    consensus on norms and thus, one further deviates from group
    consensus. Furthermore, when the isolated individual has
    denormalized from social consensus, if society's genetic epistemic
    evolution is also accelerated, then thus their separation from
    normative signaling accumulates dissonance from social consensus
    at an accelerated rate. Hence, our descent into the Singularity
    will cause the collective disharmonious impact on social consensus
    to accelarate in mutation.

- both jungian progression and regression can result from social
  isolation, (whereby in addition to other general developmental
  effects also results in) typological filtration of the social
  imposition of norms via constriction of experience-types.

> "But for him who has seen the chaos, there.is no more hiding,

  - as the variety and distribution of norms in society appears to the
    isolated person, this typological restriction make provoke a
    disnormalization of the perception of norms and/or normative
    behavior in society.
  - this disregulation of the social apprehension of norms may be
    responsible for tweaking the hyperparameters for learning and
    cognitive flexibility -- in ways both beneficial and/or
    detrimental.  Ultimately as this dysregulated state of the
    apprehension of information and belief about norms
  - as the person gradually drifts away from social consensus of
    norms, this allows them to update the hyperparameters and
    solutions in an ad hoc infinite-dimensional analytic-model of the
    world, wherein they explore the solution space in some ways
    adjacent to social consensus. this not unlike a socially
    distributed boltzmann machine -- both with and without schematic
    overlap between individual boltzmann processes' differing, but
    replicating structures -- where reintegration brings change as
    novel information structures are distributed into society and vie
    to alter group consensus. this could be imagined as a process of
    piagettian genetic epistemology, in which there is some universal
    way of communicating between social entities which are boltzmann
    processes in an ad hoc boltzmann
    - link information geometry lecture

- therefore, social disnormalization and the acceleration in evolution
  of societal norms thereof exacerbate the individual's own

### (Norms Defined As Objects Built On Multivariate Distributions)

TODO: sort imported content from notes

Modesty: discuss any deviation from norm as potential for meaning in
non-verbal communication

- a social norm is a belief about a multivariate distributions’
  characteristics: what are the perceived average or reasonable values
  for those variables. a norm is not necessarily a distribution in
  itself, but at least an informal belief about a distribution. to
  study norms, formalizing them into data-driven definitions helps,
  but also is not necessarily capable of capturing the ephemeral or
  sporadic structures that people may use to reason about them.
- disnormalization pares with a state of perceived uncertainty
  regarding the state of norms, though perhaps unconcious
- normalization as a social process is similar to normalization of
  database schema in that the social process results in the
  coalescence and distribution of (schematic abstractions) ... that is
  social norms frame informational schematic that we use to perceive
  both state in social systems and the meaning in actions/words.
- Metamodernism (as applied to norms) describes the ebb/flow between
  harmonization and disnormalization of systems. (elaborate...)
- Top down and bottom up understanding on normative social
  structures. From the bottom up, norms on interpersonal relations and
  communication stratify into increasingly sophisticated and
  regularized structures. These latter normative structures preciptate
  from human interaction and conflict at various levels (regional,
  national, contextual, etc) and include legal systems and social
  institutions (and the actions/policies/interfaces thereof)
- The point: denormalization and the state of disnormalization (even
  in norms concerning language, communication and etc), from the
  bottom up, absolutely does extend a denormalizing effect to higher
  strata. Even when norms related to social communication are
  disrupted, this can extend to unpredictable and destabilizing
  effects in regional or nation legal spheres, if this denormalization
  is significant or systemic. But the greatest potential for
  disruption emerges from the lack of awareness and unconscious
  reactions to denormalization — the people who’s social norms are
  being disrupted at an accelerating rate are almost certainly
  unconscious to the process and it’s consequences.
- emphasize the consequences to communication, language, semantics,
  relevance of symbols, and how this denormalizes the epistemic
  structures of schema and abstraction that we use to harmonize
  meaning-making in communication.  When communicating between
  divergent filter-bubbles, especially in politcal discourse,
  anticipating conveyed meaning has become a Tower of Babel. The
  confusion is intentional: filter bubbles allow various groups whose
  bubbles overlap to inculcate vastly different meaning for the same
  semiotic signifiers -- e.g. triggers, words, acronyms. To insulate
  their group from developments in disparate groups, sophisticated
  hacks of langauge are taking place to short-circuit open
  discourse.
  - long-term conditioning to normalize beliefs and reactions.
  - this confounds communication and perhaps even language. The
    semiotic remapping of the "OK" sign by the left is probably The
    Worst Example.

========

- It is a certainly a skill to pepper your rhetoric with logical
  fallacies camouflaged cleverly enough as to pass by your average
  supporter or detractor. These allow you to gain ground or cover your
  bases when responding to unforeseen development surrounding some
  issue or policy. Still, when groups (especially political groups)
  advance with overtaxed rhetoric, this makes it much easier to apply
  their own arguments and premises against them. They will be
  unwilling to walk into this trap if they see it coming, but the
  average supporter will not, if they drink the kool-aid.

![Evolution of Norms](/img/posts/2019-03-05-disnormalization/norm-evolution-1.jpg)

In the context of social norms as distributions, methods similar to KL
and OT may extrapolate forward in time the likely developments for a
given norm's distribution. Thus, as belief coalesces, this socially
distributed belief feeds back into the norm. This dependency on belief
must begin with a minimal quantity of socially distributed information
relevant to the norm being formed collectively by social groups --
albeit this does not account for the schematic aspects of norms, since
they are informal and ad hoc.

There are differential aspects to the evolution of the norm as this
quantity of socially distributed information accumulates mass and
momentum. The norm begins with some minimal "mass" of information and
gradually changes shape as it accumulates more mass or change in
momentum. During this process the initial shape of the normative
distribution, the informational salience and allocation of attention
all feedback into the process of evolution, similar to the initial
values of a differential equation. How the norm is oriented in its
nascent stages strongly impacts trajectory, tone and pace of the
normative development. Once the norm achieves widespread social
consensus, far more energy, treatment for saliency and redirection of
attention is required to result in significant changes to the
distribution. The saliency of ideas combines with and derives from
each agent's spectral consumption/emission of information. Control the
focus of agents and modulate information consumption/emission -- but
exert too much influence and artificial distortion will blind you.

![photo more clearly describing norm evolution (from index card?)]()

- perception of norms before social consensus on norms

EDIT: Prior to consensus on norms relating to a specific event or
phenomena, the structure of norms that may develop is more open
ended. In public relations, it's critical to set the tone early
because the ideas that gain momentum early become difficult to change
as social consensus begins to form. It is inevitable for some opinions
or perspectives to lose their momentum. When politicians gain ground
with fallacious arguments or with tactics requiring too many
dependencies to hold, perhaps one makes gains, but the risks for loss
may be greater. When it becomes necessary to exert energy in
controlling the evolution of social consensus, opinions or the release
of information, then simply exerting information to control these
dependencies can give you away. These are insights that may be gained
by applying the Laplacian to social information systems: where is
energy being invested to direct developments in public opinion and
why? It's critical to set the tone early, but to do so in accordance
with knowledge of future developments and with your personal values.

When you have a robust system of values that informs your ethical
behavior, your strategic calculus and your identification of
opportunity, then you act moving forwards in ways that should prevent
such regressive unraveling of gains on specific issues. If some set of
universally justified values exists upon which to base a system of
ethics (i.e. if God exists or if some other perfect values system
exists), then to be in accordance with that is to be assured that your
actions will always have been for the best. Such assumptions hinge on
whether there exists some perfect system of values, whether you are
perfectly in tune with it and whether your embodiment of those values
through your actions was optimal. Regardless -- a well-developed sense
of values informing your sense of morality and character offers
immeasurable advantages.

Social consensus on sufficient ethical behavior is not guaranteed to
be normal in a society, which must propagate norms surrounding ethical
behavior. [This article on
Aeon]((https://aeon.co/ideas/legal-standards-invoke-the-reasonable-person-who-is-it))
dives into the legalistic motivations behind determining the
reasonable person's response in specific situations. When this becomes
relevant to logic in legal argumentation -- i.e. when court decisions
must take into account some decisive conclusion as to a "reasonable
person's" action and motivation -- then such arguments become
[deontic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic) in
nature. Thus, the logic of such arguments requires assessing norms of
perception, thought, action and values in society. In criminal and
civil cases, this can help the courts determine whether such actions
were subversive: did some person determine their actions assuming they
could explain away their intents later on to avoid consequences?

### (Norms, Communication and the Expectation of Perceived Meaning)

# Wherever A Norm Exhibits Social Consensus...

- The utility of an implicit language is established by the consensus
  of norms and the perceived consensus of norms.
  - Political parties can conduct implicit communication amongst
    themselves after conditioning norms related to their platforms,
    logistics, policies and messaging. Altering any of the above, so
    long as members within or outside of the party may realistically
    acknowledge it can be used by party officials for
    signalling. Conditioning other parties to develop specific
    apprehension of norms can allow party officials to predict and
    reason about the other sides inferred meaning of action. The same
    implies to the networks of actors, sovereign, corporate or
    otherwise in the realm of international relations. Via messaging,
    communications and cultural programmes, these actors also induce
    other actors to perceive extranormal meanings.
  - In a Forbidden City palance of the Ming dynasty, it would be
    reasonable for household staff to assume any vase or object to be
    layered with additional meanings -- via extension of Wu Xing
    philosophy. The basis for signaling via these subtle explicit
    meanings would be leavened within staff by gradual
    inculcation. Those initiated into the moreso alchemical
    implications of manipulating some embued object would then be
    aware of how additional consequences may result via non-verbal
    signaling implied by the specific embued meanings. These are
    elements of semioteleological programs and protocols. It is
    expensive and risky to assume that all communication must be
    written or spoken! So, by embuing

### [Social Consensus of Abstractions is What Distinguishes Man From Animal]()

Language itself is the social consensus on abstraction.
Neuroanalytically, each abstraction is a representation in the form of
superimposed stimuli pattern within the mind, whether the stimuli
arises completely internally or externally. Many species operate with
neurological abstractions, though few develop complicated behavior
patterns with layered or interwoven abstractions. The [tool-using
carpenter finch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodpecker_finch) is an
example of an animal with sequences of problem-solving behavior
predicated on seeking objects within its environment that satisfy some
abstracted need related to shape and object properties. This finch
does not intentionally distribute information related to this behavior
to other animals.

There are other animals which socially distribute consensus of
abstraction -- meerkats are a great example with abstracted relations
within and outside of their species -- but there are no animals which
have developed the abstraction of abstractions: langauge. Language
allows man to distribute meaning with statements yielding complicated,
nuanced semantic implications upon evaluation. There are other animals
which possess some of the required neurological and genetic elements
required to partially satisfy the dependencies for language. The most
complicated seems to be a multi-generational persistence of anatomical
features required to render normative the emission of phonemes -- this
seems far more complex than satisfying the neurological
requirements. This means to epi/genetically restrict anatomical
variation of the face, tongue, diaphram, larnyx and other components
so that they are locked in across multiple generations. The complex
anatomical variation of dogs prevents such transgenerational
normificaiton of anatomic features that guarantee the capability of
phonemes. It must be
[almost-certain](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=almost+certain&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
for all members of a species to emit phonemes, given their course
anatomical development. This requires limiting phenotypic variance
resulting in change of shape to face, toungue, nasal cavity,
esophogus, diaphram -- the capability of any member of a species to
produce a given phoneme must asymptotically converge to one.

![Persistence of Memory](/img/posts/2019-03-05-disnormalization/persistence-of-memory.jpg)

Given this and the neurological requirements, then developing language
seems to be a matter of the time required to generate phonological
inter-species communication. If these are given, the stream enough
data through a socially interconnected network of analytical machines
and "Tada!" the species begins to harmonize their phonological
abstractions that signal some abstracted type of experienced stimuli,
none of which *requires* grammar which itself doubtlessly ups the
neurological requirements. Morphemes, at this point, are easy to
develop if their implied meaning is assumed by normative relationship
to environmental phenomenology -- i.e. most morphemes begin as
onomatopoeia that a species is capable of emulating.  From this point
onwards, for all increasing sophistication of linguistic abstractions
and capabilities, progress results from variety of experience,
standardization of experience, bandwidth in interspeicies
communication, neurological capabilities such as memory, variety or
utility of social behaviors exhibited by the species and the number of
simultaneously living generations -- i.e. the sociophysical
dependencies for persistence of memory. The last two in that list are
perhaps more critical than all the others?

How are meaning and processes are to be retained if the informational
units corresponding to it are not replicated and internalized?

- correlate this back towards the interpretation of morphemes and
  phonemes exemplifying norms as distributions.
  - but the perceived social consensus of some morpheme is critical to
    making assumptions about whether meaning was perceived.
  - so there is some threshold for normalization of perceived meaning
    that is required for the perception of normalization of perceived
    meaning to result
  - otherwise, members of a species could assume it would be more
    "normal" to pretend they didn't understand a word you were saying
    -- *AND HOW FRUSTRATING WOULD THAT BE?* Anyone who has experienced
    an prepubescent adolescent pretend to not understand the meaning
    implied by a word in a command can understand how frustrating that
    is. When adolescents may believe that it is reasonable to assume
    that your implied meaning wouldn't normally understood by other
    people, then they *believe* they can do whatever they want and
    then *feigning non-compliance from a misperception of meaning is a
    reasonable defense*. Just don't bet the farm on it.

- wherever there is a norm, there is the potential for signaling via
  deviation from the norm. this is one factor that drives social
  consensus for rules of etiquette and other cultural protocols: if
  the norm has wide social consensus and establishes via
  semioteleological programming protocols of both interaction and
  behavior, then its pervasiveness allows for implicit signaling by
  deviation. if do not cohere to these norms with near certainty, the
  those in the local social neighborhood cannot read your signaling
  via deviation from those perceived norms. Because society or your
  local social group coheres to the norm with near certainty, then as
  a member of that group you do not signal as much information by
  blending in to the protocols of ettiquette as you do by defying
  those norms.
  - Even though everyone may be engaged in sophisticated behaviors and
    interactions

  - if you do not know the rules, it shows -- individuals without
    cognizance of the norms that lay the groundwork of ettiquete
    behave such that their behavior places them randomly within the
    multivariate distributions for those norms. That is, when
    informally comparing naive individuals to those who are
    "well-adjusted" to the norms relevant to those social
    programmes...

  - When individuals demonstrate cognizance of patterns of norms used
    for interaction protocols, this forms a kind of fingerprint not
    unlike that of a digital signature. Since information related to
    heroin usage is suppressed, then if someone has never used heroin
    before, then because they should be unaware of norms related to
    heroin usage. It's not that hard to understand, I have simply
    modeled systematized this behavior of acquiescing cultural
    exposure via signals of cognizance to norms -- a behavior of which
    every 16 year-old is aware![^socially-retarded] These fingerprints
    for semiotelelogical programs, which leverage normative signaling,
    are more sophisticated than digital signitures in the kinds of
    queries they enable about cognizance to socioinformational
    structures.

    - Imagine training an AI algorithm in pattern recognition of these
      fingerprints of normative signaling programs.
      - For example, such AI programs might scan video, audio,
        semantic and tactical signals from conversations to be capable
        of identifying when a person exploited knowledge of norms to
        induce the activation of neurolinguistic triggers within
        another person intentionally. In this example, the AI program
        would not simply detect generally that the person intended
        this trigger to be artificially activated, but specifically,
        around which semantic/linguistic concepts the triggering
        revolved and, perhaps, what information the person intended to
        gain via artificial neurolinguistic stimulation.
        - Triggering is neurolinguistic technique that hooks into
          aspects of normative signaling.
      - This program might make inferences related to one or more of
        the following from sociophysical input regarding an individual
        or a social group:
        - &#9312; Are they aware of specific norms?
        - &#9313; Are they intentially signaling via adherence to or
          deviation from a norm?
        - &#9314;
      - How would the features be structured for the machine learning
        model?
        - They would be infinite dimensional, thus countability, the
          structure of data, comparison between feature mappings are
          all issues.
        - Because feature sets and feature mappings are difficult to
          compare for even the mathematically properties of identity
          and equality, this introduces problems of tractibility and
          confidence in results -- but paradoxically also makes
          fingerprints much

          -- individually amoung the same AI entity, but)
    - the features forming the basis of an analytical model of pattern
      recognition to detect belief, information, and cognizance of
      norms that are related to some normative signaling program.

    - their behavior is distributed along these variables and informal
      programs is not well-structured
    - however, since

    -



  (If people in society do not adhere to (any) norms), propogate the
  traditions that establish them or ... then no one can use those
  norms (nor the deviation from them) for signaling. what results is a
  gradual breakdown in the quality and consistency of both non-verbal
  and non-literal communication -- it is out-of-band signaling,
  usually broadcast on an implicit channel. Any culture which receives
  a sudden flux of cultural or economic change -- perhaps via
  imperialism or the growth of religion -- experiences a breakdown of
  such potential for communication.

  - The nature of norms as they relate to communication generally is
    not well understood by most people within a society, thus they
    can't see the socioinformational fabric shifting beneath their
    feet as it is happening. They don't understand how their
    traditions and the social consensus thereof contribute to
    effective communication, especially when it's necessary to
    communicate such that only those *inside* the culture may
    understand the implicit meanings. When the norms break down, a
    long term destabalizing effect is produced whereby signaling
    amoung members of a culture is impacted. The effect is slow. It's
    not usually perceived as it is happening. It's easy for outsiders
    to trivialize aspects of a culture that they don't understand. By
    convincing the youth to similar question traditions that seem
    backwards, the outsiders un/intentionally may damage the
    perpetuation of tradition necessary for harmony.

  - Individuals and societies are not necessarily aware of the
    teleological functions of tradition and norm. It is certainly
    useful for elders in a culture to be aware of the teleological
    aspects of norms and traditions, whether they were designed with
    purpose or where evolved ad hoc. Regardless, people tend to
    propagate the norms and traditons for which they see purpose and
    functionality. By enacting the rules of etiquette or following
    tradtion, individuals are influencing the social election of memes
    to transmit and propagate. These evolve over time, but when there
    is significant disruption that systemically affects the traditions
    of a culture, there may be unreconcilable damage to a society.

  - The implicit non-verbal communication found in traditions and in
    deviation from norms derives power from its emotional relavance in
    the psyches of those who use it to communicate. There is no
    dictionary that defines the meaning conveyed by signaling via
    tradition or norm. This lack of denotative meaning requires a
    slower, more expensive process of inculcation to socially
    distribute the connontation of communicative acts. Without this
    inculcation, individuals in the society cannot perceive these
    actions to signal meaning that is relevant or consistent. The
    connotative meanings of these actions are layered and
    duplicitous. These actions enable complex methods of signaling
    which are powerful and may only be perceived by those who
    understand them. Establishing such connotations requires
    establishing or perpetuating social memory that corresponds to
    some implicit meaning for an action, often relating to the
    teleological significane of the tradition or norm.

  - Dilute the social memory and suddenly it becomes normative to
    assume that no one knows what that means anymore. Before the age
    of the internet, this would be like making a joke with a Bonanza
    reference to a teenager in the 90's -- they have no clue what
    you're talking about. Today, this is like making references to old
    memes or memes without enough social distribution for reasonable
    expectation of consistent meaning to be conveyed. Personally, I
    detest meme templates in my newsfeed ... but please, bear with me.

Remember the first set of memes that came out? Scumbag Steve? The
Obsessed Girlfriend? There was a limited set of symbols established by
the memes, which resonated strongly enough with people to power those
meme's social election over others. From a spectral perspective on
information, the wavelengths of these memes had astronomical
amplitude. Yet, once the idea of memed-images became normalized and
the arcane secrets of automated meme-generation became commonplace,
this unleashed a deluge of idiosyncratic memes. If an internet meme
does not have wide distribution, then one cannot anticipate consistent
apprehension of meaning in those who see it -- it has not become
normalized.
- for someone to retransmit a meme, they need to assume that people on
  the receiving end get the joke. this is a belief about a normative
  distribution. (the same thing applies to jokes. what's the point in
  telling a joke if the other side can't piece together the
  informational dependencies required for the joke?)

####

![picture of Zipf's Distribution]()

Social media will never again return to a state where there the
share-frequency of memes is restricted to to such a limited set of
memes templates. To understand this, apply the idea of [Zipf's
Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) to meme
templates: from now on, the sum of all of meme distribution on social
media will spread out into over a greater number of meme
templates. There is some threshold of social consensus required for
most individuals to form the expectation that meaning will be
perceived as it is intended without denotation or clarification. When
the frequency of meme-shares becomes diluted into so many meme
templates, it is rare for any meme to naturally gain enough momentum
to surpass that threshold.

#### Hence, Pew Die Pie Meme Review, Amplifying Your Memes

As a sociocultural phenomenon that emerged primarily from the UI/UX
design considerations of Twitter and Facebook, reasoning about how and
why people elect internet memes as a vehicle for communication is
fascinating. Why did facebook introduce the feature that attaches a
background image to be attached to a simple textual status update
message? Because memes are a hack: the idea is that your potential
viewers are scrolling quickly. If your text is large and simple with
an easily recognized image, this is far more likely to have its
meaning conveyed within the UI/UX confines of mobile social
media. Thus the form factors of social media are exhibiting a grossly
destabalizing effect on the quality of communication -- see the
footnote for specific criticism.[^neuro-social-media]

I'm critical of memes primarily because too many complex ideas are
condensed into a picture with 50 words or less. This results in
impaired communication: too much communication on the internet has
simply become noise. I don't care how many likes some image has --
unless I get a good laugh ... but isn't that just the intellectual
equivalent of junk food? Are people seriously stupefied on how Russia
hacked the American election? Can you actually hack a communications
system that's inherently broken? Regardless of whether Russia
interfered or the specifics of the details thereof ... do Americans
actually expect for people to have reasonable opinions on critical
issues? Most terrifying: blame it on Russia or don't, is there any way
to fix the true underlying problems?

Doesn't democracy depend on an informed public? What are the
consequences on disregulation of communication?




- semiotics, semantics and reasonable expectations of meaning.

- when can one reasonably expect meaning to be conveyed? how do people
  communicate about norms?
  - how can people expect to communicate with body language? how does
    one decide whether a gesture will be received as intended.

### What Happens When Norms Evolve Faster Than People Can Keep Up?

In our descent towards the Singularity, humanity will see
disnormalization at a scale never seen in history.

  - explain the sociocultural phenomena of disnormatization as a
    metaphor to breaking the speed of sound.
    - as we approach the singularity, technology and culture evolve
      faster than norms can be established and diffused. Since the
      human brain is an analytical machine, people require
      conditioning via experience (to develop the social instantiation
      of types of beliefs upon which norms are constructed). That is,
      an individual's conception of a norm requires some type,
      metatype or abstraction of experience whereby beliefs about
      aggregate beliefs are grouped.
      - To develop beliefs about norms, individuals must reason about
        how others categorize, structure and organize their
        experiences, information or beliefs.
      - Similarly to how grouping a SQL table by the `id` column
        returns a result where all the counts are 1, attempting to...

      - assertions about norms, proactively establishing norms and
        diffusing information to reinforce social perception of norms
        each alleviate problems related to tractibility in
        sociophysical systems.
        - since it's impossible to reason about socially distributed
          information in totality, people instead reason with
          approximated representations of aggregate belief.

    - similar to how breaking the sound barrier introduces completely
      novel dynamics for aerospace engineers to design around.
      - in any dynamical system, the emergence of specific dynamics
        can impact the system such that fundamentally novel measures
        are required to address these. Simply expecting a linear
        increase of *more of the same* to address engineering
        challenges at transonic speeds is not enough.
      - e.g. the sudden emergence of [vapor
        cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_cone) at transonic
        speeds is introduced by extreme fluctuations in pressure and
        temperature that affect the rate of water condensation. This
        changes the composition, distribution and phases of matter in
        the air, which impacts the surface of the jet in fundamentally
        novel ways.

![F-18C Vapor Cones and Condensation Clouds at transonic speeds]()

  - Such insights from dynamical systems may be carried back over to
    the phenomena of disnormalization, (which the world is only
    beginning to see). The sonic boom and transonic phenomena are
    unlike most dynamical phenomena in that there is a sudden boundary
    beyond which the phenomena is seen -- the range of transonic
    speeds.
  - How does industry in Silicon Valley diffuse information into
    society? How does one explain the phenomenological implications of
    data science, machine learning and networked computer systems to a
    five-year old or to your grandmother?
    - When these technologies evolve faster, how does the rate of
      sociocultural adaptation match the technology's rollout? Can
      people adapt quickly enough? There seems to be a point at which
      the rate of change of technology, analogous to the speed of the
      jet, far exceeds some maximal rate of sociocultural adaption,
      analogous to the propagation of vibrations in air molecules
      around the jet. What results is the emergence of convoluted
      dynamics in sociocultural evolution which are similar to
      transonic dynamics that emerge at the speed of sound.
    - any approach to social engineering to accommodate for these
      novel dynamics must account for them, while ensuring the
      powerful does not seek to abuse disnormalization by selectively
      conducting social engineering -- which has been happening with
      technology for decades.

  be useful for filtration of extrapolations of notions of EVOLVING
  SYSTEM STATE in graph/simplex/network theory analogies of PDE’s

- when paths emerging on top of a causal graph/network are then
  assigned probability/valuation, then these sobolev-space objects
  could filter combinatorially constructed paths, finding those least
  reasonably likely to introduce discontinuities.

  - further, a sort of complementary object to this Sobolev
    construction for filtration of paths could operate on the (1
    -P(e)) complement to paths. thereby, such objects might filter out
    paths/cliques on the causal graph most likely to result in
    infinitesimal consequences.

  - Combining this with the notion of causal inferences utilizing a
    “light-cone & world-line” (from Terrence Tao’s Summary
    Introduction to Approaches for Navier-Stokes, where consequences
    of fluid interactions are limited/filtered by tools from
    relativity like the light-cone) should provide a powerful set of
    tools for identifying the intersection of cliques/paths in a
    causal graph with confluential consequences relevant to causal
    outcomes.

    - Also, the “light-cone/world-line” tools

  - touch on how the distributed nature of agency in AI entities will
    allow them outpace man's ability to keep up with disnormalization.
    - so while we will struggle with social consensus of meaning and
      norms, (artificial entities will have much less difficulty doing
      so.)
    - How will this play out? how will complexity, computational power
      and energy shape the emergent dynamics for the distribution of
      entities? phenomenologically, what patterns and dynamics will
      humanity see emerge? What is certain is that energy, complexity
      and time all imply that the future must contain a limited set of
      super-human AI entities. What will determine the number and
      ranking of strong AI entities? The nature of will, power and
      determinism implies that entities with greater will and power
      project their will through quasi-dependent agents whose behavior
      is almost deterministically locked to the directives of the
      superior entities. Via power, some entities project their will
      to enact agents under their influence. For artificial entities
      competing over limited energy who must also balance
      computational priorities, this implies dynamics, patterns and
      phenomena emerge that strongly advantage a limited number of
      entities and strongly disadvantage most entities. Thus, a
      limited number of AI's should compete with/against themselves
      and humanity for control. How much total power these super-AI's
      possibly have is dependent on how much free energy is availabe
      on Earth for computation, but also on how artificial entities
      will tend to align themselves in networks of power.

      - Here, the Taboo Index renders the behavior of most artificial
        entities to be deterministic.
