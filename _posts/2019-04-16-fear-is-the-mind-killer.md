### Fear Is The Mind Killer

- TODO: ensure the content in these notes have been covered.
- how fear constricts/filters the mind’s awareness & cognitive
  processes to those that are more immediate, both in space & time
- how fear alters the direction/orientation of attention (i.e. causes
  people to orient their attention/cognition towards more immediate
  time/space/ideas)
  - that is, when you provoke a fearful state of mind (especially
    during the transition into that fearful state), the person
    withdraws their dispersion of attention towards objects, places,
    times, memories, ideas and the like that are “closer” or of higher
    priority towards their current context.
  - how this impacts cognitive processes, specifically with regard to
    how the person restricts or filters their consideration of ideas
    in the “frame/perspective” to smaller timescales
  - focus on spatial, temporal, and “epistemological” constriction
  - is this related to a pupil dilation or contraction (evidence of
    the correlation of instinctual response to the inner cognitive
    processes)

Have you noticed how dark it is out there in the modern world? There
is a frightnening blanket of darkness threatens our lands confusing
our subjects's minds. Nothing can be known with certainty. Lies and
deceit are spewing out of rectangular portals, parroted by the naïve,
and sharpened into unweildy weapons for knaves. All to cover up lies
and deceit -- but whose? Nobody knows. Spirits and daemonic forces are
brewed from dark energy, stirring up mobs -- the rich, the poor, the
doomsayers, the opportunists, the terrified and the terrifying.

Imagine laboring in a coalmine in the late 19th century. Power and
information flows from the top, one is turned against the other and
every spends their money at the company store, but where does all it
go? Straight back to the top. In this mine of theirs, you never see
the light of day and you might not know who you're talking to and
perhaps even who you're talking about. Everyone wears headlamps, the
kind that coalminers still wear today. If you're lucky, your piercing
luminance might refract and illuminate a diamond in the rough.

Be steady about your feet and shine the light where you step. People
who get injured down here might not come back for another day's
bread. Look around you. In your mind's eye, did you turn your head?
Everyone sees where you're looking -- that beam of radiant light
flowing outwards from betwixt your eyes conveys precious information.
To you, to others, from you and from others. You can all instantly see
where each man is looking. Their light informs you of the dangerous
precipices below you. You can see where they see and it shows you
where loose gravel might have you slip into a pit of choking darkness,
where you'll rot alone with just a few unwise cigarettes to nurse your
broken bones.

Some days, near unexplored regions, the canary doesn't make it
out. There are ghost stories about some of these networks in your cave
system and no one goes down there -- no one has ever been down there.
Yet, never being one whose disposing is tireless servitude, you crave
the day where you'll bring out a cache of diamonds, secretly, but
they're all in the deepest, darkest recesses.

Now, imagine there's strange source magnetic interference in the
area. It penetrates all the craggy layers of bedrock -- shale, coal
and all. To this field, each man's headlamp is attuned. When this
interference pulses, each man's lamp brightens or it dims, all at the
same time. Sometimes it creeps in slowly, sometimes it affects just
the miners next to you and other times it takes the entire crew by
suprise. Everyone sits in darkness staring at the sanguine filaments
of the dimmed lamps, motionless. Everyone in the company swears it is
a ghost or that some shafts are haunted. With sharp memory and focus,
one can remember the way out.

### [Fear *is* the Mind Killer]()

This interference is the sociophysical field of fear, the headlamps
are your attention and the cave is always changing. The light from
these lamps is just like the field of view that FPS AI uses to process
its understanding of your movements.

What you empower with your attention is illuminated to others and each
miner recognizes that, to survive, they must see what others see and
what they are looking for. Some people have intuition for this and
never think about it consciously. To the mob, gravitating towards the
maximums of collective attention is how they've always known to
live. With social media, the surfaces of the cave are changing faster
-- but each man will always have the same capacity for attention.

There is another sociophysical force field: love. Machiavelli wrote
about fear and love -- both have powerful effects on attention, but
each act in qualitatively different ways. Both are important and both
have positive and negative effects for the individual and for local
social groups like family and friends. Both exhibit positive and
negative dynamics in aggregate for the collective. Fear helps you
avoid danger and focus on what you need. Love gives you hope, gives
you peace or at least helps you forget.

Psychologists and neurologists have studied what happens when your
mind becomes overwhelmed by fear. Psychologists and neurologists write
about this evoked emotional state in the subject as the "fight or
flight response" and it can emerge naturally in all situations in
life. Often, it's colloquially explained with references to your older
"lizard brain" which formed over the core of the brain and processes
information at lighting speeds. But, when you are overtaken by fear,
whether it is fear in the moment or fermented dread, the effects on
your attention are similar: your attention narrows and without control
your conscious mind yields priority processing to your lizard
brain. You process much less information with prefrontal cortex and
you don't generate new possibilities. To those in power or those
lusting after it, *proactively* influencing the field of fear tends to
cause subjects of their actions to respond *reactively*. The set of
possible reactions evaluated by the mind is filtered as the
attention. Whether the person manipulating with fear acts violently or
happens to disguise their behavior as socially acceptable, if they are
aware of the cognitive ramifications, then they know they can use your
vulnerable state of mind to make inferences about the predictability
of your various reactions.

That someone would intend to use fear in this way is usually a warning
sign of a threatening situation, though using fear does have its
purposes. In situations where violence or deceit is in the wheelhouse,
you should immediately suppress the fight or flight response and
*project* a sense of being in control while you resort to cunning and
guile to get the fuck out. That is, you project that you already know
what you're going to do; you suppress saccadic movements of the eyes,
you consciously direct your attention to what you want them to react
to, but without setting off the threat. Their level of cognizance and
possible previous history of being in these situations will speak
volumes about how they expect to be able to use fear to coerce
disadvantageous responses from their subject. Use that knowledge to
your advantage. Know your enemy.

If they are cognizant, it will not be an accident that you are caught
in an intensely vulnerable situation. That there is one exit or that
your physical options and movement paths are limited or that you're
outnumbered or that you were emotionally riled up or were probed for
vulnerability and/or profit potential (e.g. in violent theft) -- none
of these factors will be accidental. Therefore, control the
circumstances to ensure you avoid incidentally encountering vulnerable
situations and they will never initiate the situation you fear.
Further, after multiple attempts to place you in vulnerable
circumstances, you can intuit their cognizance to act ... more or
less. Unless it's a junkie or a spineless thief, if they know you've
had time to permute the circumstances and detect the nascent threat,
they won't act at all, without overwhelming motivation/power. Doesn't
mean they weren't thinking about it. And [limited] empathy with the
potential offender will tell you, they usually must have time to plan
what they're going to do. They've thought about it or they're
executing preconditioned behavior patterns and the potential for a
profitable situation emerged to trigger it. A junkie who owes money or
needs drugs is in the process of finding a victim.

As you juxtapose the circumstances, read their level of control to
reorient the situation back to what they imagined. If there are risks,
they've thought about controlling the risks and random perturbations
forces them into cognitive overdrive to reevaluate risk and
control. They can't act without letting you in: they have to be aware
of risk, as the situation develops and thus, their mind is toggling
between lizard brain and prefrontal cortex. If premeditated, they've
already committed the crime in their mind. This is also a risky
potential attack vector for you, since they assume you don't know what
they're planning. You can fuck with their head emotionally, but not
with the wrong type of offender.

Above all else, avoid these situations entirely. That means to probe
the minds of people you become involved with and examine past patterns
of behavior -- *before you need to react*. To respond, you need to
have already conditioned patterns that make you strong. Offenders,
sociopaths and psychopaths preying with fear will stay away from you
if you are strong or look like a problem. Unless they're psychotic and
irrational, then when they use fear, they are probing you intensely
for feedback to inform their next actions. This, unexpectedly, gives
you power over them (but can also backfire).

Using fear is like tricking someone into not using half their chess pieces.
- Controlling a situation by focusing the mind of the adversary or
  victim towards the potential losses from mistakes and away from
  accurately evaluating the probabilities. This doesn’t work on
  someone if they are prepared, informed, strong, values-oriented or
  stupid. Like all other circumstances with risk, you have to
  disconnect yourself from the potential losses. Otherwise, you will
  develop a skewed perspective or attitude. Someone cognizantly using
  fear will try to skew the distribution of your potential
  responses. This makes all paths of action/reactions from the current
  state much more predictable. It’s like imagining potential enemy
  positions in an FPS map after shrinking the map in half, which makes
  strategy far more computable. Controlling outcomes for the better by
  making them more predictable can justify the use of fear.

- copy notes about configuration space/entropy for chess pieces
  - (predicting an opponents moves by reasoning about "normal" board
    configurations for current and descendant board configurations)

- If social engineers leverage the fields of love/fear to modulate
  attention sociophysically, a potential systemic tail risk arises
  when the force of fear tends to expand the space of the unknown. We
  fear what we don’t understand, but if there is systematic aversion
  of attention away from what we fear, the frequency of doxastic
  updates slows to a crawl. That is, when it changes for better or
  worse, people don’t stay apprised of whether a threat that should be
  feared has quickly grown stronger.


# Machiavellian Δ(Love) and Δ(Fear)

### ⊗ (Power Tactics projecting force onto the fields of love & fear)

- most people are unwisely averse to learning about the mechanics of
  fear/evil or even those of power. people who build power through
  darker means, like the projection of love/fear, necessarily must
  operate in darkness.
- for most people, this can delay the acquisition of the tools of
  power. worse, since they don’t understand fear as used in power
  tactics, their innocence has only served to butter them up as naïve
  victims.
- fear games our collective compulsion to seek security, typically
  defined by those engaging in threat construction.

- (1) They prefer secrecy of method/intent
- (2) This secrecy enables manipulation of information unknown to the
  individuals who can be most effectively controlled by power/fear
  when they find it difficult to name or reason about the
  threat(s). the phenomena, mechanics and dynamics are unconscious to
  them.
- (3) They retain the posture to lash back in many more ways than
  their adversaries or pawns feel comfortable engaging. adverseries
  and pawns have little confidence that they can resist without
  suffering reprisal that yields a net loss to their interests.
- (4) The game of fear is a pyramid scheme, levering influence over
  third parties, the mechanics/limitations for which neither your
  network nor your adversaries can understand/articulate/predict.
- (5) They systemically disrupt communication. In the past, it was
  sufficient to manipulate the geographic or physical
  positions/containment of your threats. What one subject/pawn learns,
  if they can’t communicate, then others cannot become conscious to
  the tools of power. it can also make the subjects afraid to
  innovate. this weakness to centralized, domestic power can quickly
  turn into systemic helplessness against external powers.

### Machiavellian Love & Fear, continued

- (6) So the game of fear is like bluffing in poker: you win biggest
  when, despite a bad hand, you drive other players to
  miscalculate. you must understand enough about their state,
  cognitive processes and decision making to understand how to
  create/utilize doxastic leverage to force their hand. As long as you
  can pay out on your threats when people call your bluffs; if not you
  will quickly lose face and your credibility will require emotionally
  violent action to repair — if abusing fear is critical to your
  tactics and strategy.

- (7) most critically, you must know how to create and apply your
  leverage by systemically influencing the narratives and beliefs
  individuals create. doing so requires “cultivating an air of fear” —
  you must understand how to create and persist informational
  asymmetries, which always requires social compartmentalization of
  information — darkness. Darkness is not always benefit evil, good
  can also be strengthened or galvanized against evil in darkness.

### People Fear What They Do Not Understand

- (1) if people fear what they do not understand … then why do they
  not fear society’s abundantly lacking understanding of the tactics
  of fear and power? they are conned into believing that in ignorance
  and darkness, they will be safe. when the only thing to fear is fear
  itself, then why don’t people reach for its antidotes: knowledge,
  righteousness, justice, truth, reason, self-sacrifice, but above all
  else *understanding applied to fear itself*

- (2) because until it’s too late for action, the society drunk on the
  influence of fear had mistaken supposed comfort or insurance against
  constructed threats as safety. They fear what gives them power over
  the tactics of fear. They thought they had comfort or insurance,
  foresight or strength.

- (3) such is typical because fear is intrinsically connected to
  confusion, complexity, confidence. Why? Fear, as a generalized
  tactic, only pays when misinformation yields invalidity and
  miscalculation. this confidence in safety is usually misplaced
  confidence in people, facts & circumstances. again, to abuse fear,
  those in power must socially compartmentalize information to
  cultivate informational asymmetries.

### Fear Of The Unnamed and Of The Unnameable

- (4) one does not simply fear the unnamed, nor can they fear the
  unnameable, per se. the unnameable cannot be dissected. while people
  have the chance to act, fear controls the range of actions they
  consider their perception of information systems distorts the
  apparent probabilities of consequences. because rising up requires
  self-sacrifice (which is meaningless when it can be systemically
  muted), they cannot accurately assess what the likelyhood of the
  adversaries responses against them will be, especially given social
  compartmentalization of information. thus, because they fear the
  unnamed and especially the unnameable, those rising up are unwilling
  to apply leverage. lack of action contributes to statistical
  distortion of perceived probabilities of adversarial reaciton. you
  cannot gauge an adversaries strength, against whom you refuse to
  test engagement. therefore, they also lack experience in handling
  the consequences, so when they finally act, they ability to
  accurately foresee the first-order and second-order consequences of
  their actions, whereas their adversary who exploits the
  informational asymmetry is able to see & understand the causal
  nature of their interactions with those whom they have subjugated.
