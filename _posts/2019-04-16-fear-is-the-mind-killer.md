Fear and the hero’s journey.

- undivided music video

- Love doesn’t scale very well. It’s network effects requires people
  being receptive to it (it has a dyadic nature) and needs people to
  be capable of giving it to propagate it’s effects. When some people
  are so shut out of the system that they never experience true
  platonic love for long periods of time, they forget how to show it
  to other people (incels). Fear on the other hand exerts a kind of
  monopolar influence on its field. It doesn’t depend on volition,
  compliance or receptive nature in the object of fear. It forces the
  development of these things. Acting out of fear of withdrawal or
  deprivation of love is not motivation by love. It is motivation by
  fear and what you receive by compliance is not true love. True love
  is given unconditionally. It is a gift that is given on the basis of
  hope that the love will be returned.

========

Have you noticed how dark it is out there in the (modern) world? There
is a frightnening blanket of darkness threatens our lands confusing
our subjects' minds. Nothing can be known with certainty. Lies and
deceit are spewing out of rectangular portals, parroted by the naïve,
and sharpened into unweildy weapons for knaves. All to cover up lies
and deceit -- but whose? Nobody knows. Spirits and daemonic forces are
brewed from dark energy, stirring up mobs -- the rich, the poor, the
doomsayers, the opportunists, the terrified and the terrifying.

Imagine laboring in a coalmine in the late 19th century. Power and
information flows from the top, one is turned against the other and
every spends their money at the company store, but where does all it
go? Straight back to the top. In this mine of theirs, you never see
the light of day and you might not know who you're talking to and
perhaps even who you're talking about. Everyone wears headlamps, the
kind that coalminers still wear today. If you're lucky, your piercing
luminance might refract and illuminate a diamond in the rough.

Be steady about your feet and shine the light where you step. People
who get injured down here might not come back for another day's
bread. Look around you. In your mind's eye, did you turn your head?
Everyone sees where you're looking -- that beam of radiant light
flowing outwards from betwixt your eyes conveys precious information.
To you, to others, from you and from others. You can all instantly see
where each man is looking. Their light informs you of the dangerous
precipices below you. You can see where they see and it shows you
where loose gravel might have you slip into a pit of choking darkness,
where you'll rot alone with just a few unwise cigarettes to nurse your
broken bones.

Some days, near unexplored regions, the canary doesn't make it
out. There are ghost stories about some of these networks in your cave
system and no one goes down there -- no one has ever been down there.
Yet, never being one whose disposing is tireless servitude, you crave
the day where you'll bring out a cache of diamonds, secretly, but
they're all in the deepest, darkest recesses.

![Coal Miners](/img/posts/fear-is-the-mind-killer/coal-miners.jpg)

Now, imagine there's strange source magnetic interference in the
area. It penetrates all the craggy layers of bedrock -- shale, coal
and all. To this field, each man's headlamp is attuned. When this
interference pulses, each man's lamp brightens or it dims, all at the
same time. Sometimes it creeps in slowly, sometimes it affects just
the miners next to you and other times it takes the entire crew by
suprise. Everyone sits in darkness staring at the sanguine filaments
of the dimmed lamps, motionless. Everyone in the company swears it is
a ghost or that some shafts are haunted. With sharp memory and focus,
one can remember the way out.

There are agents of evil roaming in the darkness, looking for those
who have seen the truth. Unbeknownst to those just beginning to wake
up, there are event-driven responses scripted into the world, waiting
to be triggered to swallow whole those who have glimpsed the truth.
Do not fall under their power. Do not fall under their spell. This
response, in itself, is an enchantment in play -- they want you to be
silent. What you don't know can't hurt you, but it will make you
weaker.

When fear makes society weaker by systemically dampening the
individual's power, that is when we will surely suffer. If not today,
then tomorrow. If not from within, then from without.  Economic
externalies are a soberity reality, but so are sociopolitical
externalities. Power flows upwards from the people. Disaster awaits
when we are terrified of our own strength. We should be independent,
resilient and aware.

# (Delineating Love and Fear)

(re-segue: This interference) is the sociophysical field of fear, the
headlamps are your attention and the cave is always changing. The
light from these lamps is just like the field of view that FPS AI uses
to process its understanding of your movements.

What you empower with your attention is illuminated to others and each
miner recognizes that, to survive, they must see what others see and
what they are looking for. Some people have intuition for this and
never think about it consciously. To the mob, gravitating towards the
maximums of collective attention is how they've always known to
live. With social media, the surfaces of the cave are changing faster
-- but each man will always have the same capacity for attention.

There is another sociophysical force field: love. Machiavelli wrote
about fear and love -- both have powerful effects on attention, but
each act in qualitatively different ways. Both are important and both
have positive and negative effects for the individual and for local
social groups like family and friends. Both exhibit positive and
negative dynamics in aggregate for the collective. Fear helps you
avoid danger and focus on what you need. Love gives you hope, gives
you peace or at least helps you forget.

- TODO: clarify machiavellian definitions of love and fear.
  - they are not opposites, but how they differ from each other needs
    clarification. comparison of love and fear requires dilineating
    the types of subjects and objects of each.
    - e.g. for some types of objects of fear, can the subject
      simultaneously express love for those things? (i think of course
      you can, but how specifically and what this means qualitatively
      both depend strongly on the subjects/objects)
    - a good example is God, of whom we are told to fear and love
      ... but why?
      - other more non-religious examples?

### Fear Is The Mind Killer

- TODO: ensure the content in these notes have been covered.
- how fear constricts/filters the mind’s awareness & cognitive
  processes to those that are more immediate, both in space & time
- how fear alters the direction/orientation of attention (i.e. causes
  people to orient their attention/cognition towards more immediate
  time/space/ideas)
  - that is, when you provoke a fearful state of mind (especially
    during the transition into that fearful state), the person
    withdraws their dispersion of attention towards objects, places,
    times, memories, ideas and the like that are “closer” or of higher
    priority towards their current context.
  - how this impacts cognitive processes, specifically with regard to
    how the person restricts or filters their consideration of ideas
    in the “frame/perspective” to smaller timescales
  - focus on spatial, temporal, and “epistemological” constriction
  - is this related to a pupil dilation or contraction (evidence of
    the correlation of instinctual response to the inner cognitive
    processes)


### fear pulls people apart, love pulls people together.

- while the fields of love and fear both influence and are influenced
  by people's attention, the distinction between love and fear arises
  in one's intention to influence the object. specifically, do they
  intend to pull it closer or push it away. fear causes the dispersion
  of one's attention to focus inwards on immediate space, time and
  ideas, whereas love causes one's attention to open outwards to
  include more possibilities.
  - love facilitates the discussion of new possibilities by
    influencing the intention, motivation and structure of social
    interaction. art flourishes during times of peace, prosperity and
    stability.
  - since the impact that the attention has on the fields of love and
    fear can create feedback on the fields, ...
    - counterintuitive effects may also arise to create "bounding"
      effects because each individual has a limited capacity for
      attention (that determines the objects their cognition is
      focused on.)
      - also, people tend to direct their attention towards the
        laplacian of the field of attention and towards the gradient
        of the magnitude of field effects. thus, wherever people are
        directing their attention, other people are sure to look.

    - depending on qualities of the object of fear and the personality
      of the person experiencing it, the object may exert magnetism on
      their attention or they may feel repulsed by it.
      - to objects that trigger mild fear or disease, many people
        condition themselves to not examine those types of
        things. they won't direct their attention towards that and
        condition themselves to become unconscious to it. if the
        object is worthy of your fear or is associated with risk of
        high-impact events, .... (then that's stupid, isn't it?)
        - some objects trigger fear or unease about some quality
          related to the person experiencing it. it's not the object,
          per se, but the subjective associations that provoke the
          fear or distress response. they are responding to something
          internal .... (and that's stupid, isn't it?)
          - in these causes, there is usually disruption of the
            person's projection on the field of attention, resulting
            in mild turbulent effects on their cognition, but they
            can't exactly fight & flight from themselves, can they?
          - how they respond to this instability of cognition after
            being triggered by association to themselves says a lot
            about their personality, their psychology and their
            ability to control their social circumstances.
            - this can be particularly fucked up for those who have
              personality complexes (attachment disorder, obsessive
              compulsive, persecution complex, etc), those who are
              socially weak or unable to repair the damage, those with
              a tendancy to ruminate or obsess.
              - especially when you are cognizant of their
                psychological complexes or intend to create damage
                which is to weigh them down for the rest of their life
                with rumination that cannot be explained by design.
            - this technique to trigger disruption of cognition in
              myself and others was used time and time again by
              workplace bullies, who would install associations to
              trigger in others surrounding me when they found that
              the triggers they tried to program me weren't effective
              enough.
            - the point was to influence the attention and thoughts of
              others to repel them away from me, so that i would be
              disconnected at work and thus vulnerable.

  - how love as an attractive force can be misused.
  - fear pulls people apart (at the macro level), but can compel
    people to come together at the micro level. fear can be used to
    funnel or corral people towards certain ends. fear causes people
    to formalize rules for social behavior out of concern for their
    safety, which impacts the degree of social flux. if you cannot
    trust your neighbor or stranger, this has a profound effect on the
    volume of social flux. people become reticent to form new bonds
    with each other: their social valence becomes resistent to social
    bonding. in the long term, this has a systemic effect at the
    [nanoeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoeconomics) level
    by influencing the formation of connections required to acquire
    leads, for customer acquisition/retention, etc. -- especially for
    small businesses.
  - love pulls people together on all levels: from individual to the
    micro to the macro. counterintuitively, this can cause people to
    pull apart, since to turn your limited attention towards one group
    or individual, you almost certainly must direct it away from
    others.
  - both fear and love may cause the attention to be strongly
    modulated or funneled by unconscious forces. when these influences
    are conscious, (the effects they have on an individual's attention
    via love and fear are more predictable.)
    - however, when the object of love or fear is unconscious, the
      individual's changes in cognitive state can cause the
      orientation of their attention to erratically toggle between
      various objects. this disperses their attention, but an
      adversary can use fear/love to direct their attention towards
      specific objects/goals in a heuristic manner, without the person
      becoming conscious to what is being used to drive them.
    - i'm only writing about what has happened to me, whereof the
      reasoning nor the methods was i ever meant to understand.

- Cultivation of bonds of obligation in subjects via methods fomenting
  love/fear. ![XV the devil]()

- The eyes of Janus and how fear constricts your temporal
  consideration of memories & ideas to a narrow slice of future and
  past
- Fear of death and fear of finality (fate) being the same. When
  strategic calculations can disregard fear of death... can the
  adversary do the same? How does fear of death factor into Hegel’s
  definition of subjectivity as a doubly negative collapse of
  extension of experience? (Death is itself a discontinuity of
  experience, meaning the perceived paths leading to it produce
  discontinuities in this Hegelian collapse) This doubly negative
  collapse is not unlike structures from epistemic/doxastic logic
  reflecting upon themselves (in relation to the other). So what do
  these discontinuities in extrapolated agency of entities mean?
- Insects/spiders typically physically move along the gradients of
  temperature, food and security against threats.
  - Imagine being barely more than an insect whose motion is defined
    by instinct, who can apprehend nothing more about its unfolding
    experience than what it can predict about paths of motion within
    some small frame of time. The more complex the systems of motion
    (physical and sociophysical), the more subjective the nature of
    reasoning about them is. But imagine you’re a try hard insect
    facing certain death, which is like a particularly resonant
    discontinuity in your apprehension of the near future from your
    perceived subjective experience: briefly *all* paths seem to lead
    to oblivion. Death as a discontinuity in subjective flows of
    information about potential experience is but the most extreme of
    such discontinuities. In this regard, (from a Hedegarian
    perspective), life experience that results in sociophysical
    information closing the door to those paths is not unlike a small
    death. Containing a manifestation of the phenomena of spirit to a
    (locked room).
- In order for society to produce a collective response to certain
  doom, its individuals must harmonize facets of this self-reflective
  epistemic structure representing each one’s subjective awareness, in
  order to recognize that the paths its collective is taking are
  leading it off a cliff. When communication is systematically
  impaired, the process can not produce or reason about harmonic
  common beliefs. (in hegelian terms, expanding self-consciousness?)
- Contrast these discontinuities with those of a different kind that
  are introduced by new life. (How does this relate to Hegelian
  bifurcations?) describe fear as the sociophysical field that emerges
  from subjective reflection on ends and love as the field that
  emerges from reflections on beginnings. What people usually miss
  seeing with the finality of endings and the unknowns of beginnings
  is that everything is continuously being reborn and that there are
  new beginnings in every end and endings in every beginning.
  - (it is this focus on) new beginnings through others (and even
    through the literal birth of new life/awareness) that requires the
    field of love to operate on a multipolar basis.
    - love expands social valence but its potential is also
      generated/accumulated by social valence. whereas fear constricts
      social valence
      - where the higher-order intentions motivating the tactical
        application of fear may be to expand
        valence/flexilibity/options, but it does so by reducing this
        elsewhere, hence making the system more predictable in some
        areas.
    - it is the focus on endings/finalities that renders the field of
      fear a monopolar basis.
    - these are both accomplished by widening/narrowing the conditions
      of possibility (?)
- What this conception of Hegelian metaphysics/subjectivity (and
  discontinuities of love/birth/beginnings & fear/death/endings) mean
  in the context of and mechanics surrounding artificial
  intelligence’s ability to replicate (connections to distributed
  entity/agency)
  - How do the methods of statecraft in the prince change with
    artificial entities? (e.g. do artificial entities display loyalty
    or fealty? Can they be motivated by love or fear? Or only
    attention?)
  - explain hegelian master/slave dialectic in terms of two chess
    players, where the slaves are the chess pieces and the masters are
    the chess players. their actions in moving chess pieces must be
    carried out not by the rules of chess, but by creating forces to
    act on others in society. if it could be said that one chess
    player can sufficiently predict the moves of the other, in hegel's
    own poor choice of words, that player becomes slave to the other,
    as the master has internalized models of the lesser player's
    cognition, which is now its object.
    - briefly call attention to problems of complexity and scalability
      in the horizontal scalability of social hierarchies
      - how GAI cannot transcend this complexity, but may try.
      - bayesian non-parametrics (and other AI methods) result in
        complexity that must be mitigated with force, especially to
        conserve


“For injuries ought to be done all at one time...” (end of chapter 8).

- In the course of statecraft, Machiavelli’s prince allows you to
  foresee where there would be friction in the projection of
  energy. With this understanding, one can envision which
  principalities are rising, which are soon to fall, towards which
  your adversaries are likely to project their energy, and how to
  devise first-order strategies to undermine the strengths of
  principalities to further your projection of energy by crafting the
  tools to suit the appearances of affairs to your ends.
- The evil deeds done serve to foster information to cultivate
  fear. By reengaging in these acts (which are never meant to be
  understood), one creates vectors of a causal nature which may be
  used as pretext to justify action or to strengthen persuasion for
  action.
- This technique relies on exaggeration of the dissonance between
  probability/expectation of infinitesimal events and the beliefs
  about their probabilities/expectations. This kind of ruler wants to
  commit the minimal amount of infinitesimally probable
  transgressions, such that the people fear that retribution is
  certain and that these events previously considered infinitesimal
  are instead rare, unless retribution is deserved. People act
  according to their conception of the appearances of systems, not
  according to the actual inner workings. Before people have
  consciously decided to form beliefs about someone or some system,
  the range of beliefs that they can form is most pliable. After these
  beliefs have been formed and reinforced by intentional cognition
  about things related to them, they become more rigid. This descends
  from the nature of the brain as an analytical machine.
- People will seek to avoid what they fear (that you created), so they
  will move away from it and towards the fulfillment of your will
  (attracted towards potential “love” or a cheap substitute for
  it). The information created by acts of love, which itself is
  usually misunderstood by people, only seem to satisfy the need for
  love by satisfying people’s needs, which can always be counted on
  returning. Thus, they have substituted in their minds the brief
  fulfillment of need for love and can be counted on soon returning
  for what they cannot provide for themselves in such a system which
  eschews independence of its (subjects) for the security of the
  self-interests of the ruling elite.
  - it is impossible or unwise to attempt (to manipulate through love
    and fear) lacking a set of archetypes coupled with the
    understanding of how their representations are subjectively
    perceived in the population.

# [Fear *is* the Mind Killer]()

Psychologists and neurologists have studied what happens when your
mind becomes overwhelmed by fear. Psychologists and neurologists write
about this evoked emotional state in the subject as the "fight or
flight response" and it can emerge naturally in all situations in
life. Often, it's colloquially explained with references to your older
"lizard brain" which formed over the core of the brain and processes
information at lighting speeds. But, when you are overtaken by fear,
whether it is fear in the moment or fermented dread, the effects on
your attention are similar: your attention narrows and without control
your conscious mind yields priority processing to your lizard
brain. You process much less information with prefrontal cortex and
you don't generate new possibilities. To those in power or those
lusting after it, *proactively* influencing the field of fear tends to
cause those subjected to their actions to respond *reactively*. The
set of possible reactions evaluated by the mind is filtered as the
attention. Whether the person manipulating with fear acts violently or
happens to disguise their behavior as socially acceptable, if they are
aware of the cognitive ramifications, then they know they can use your
vulnerable state of mind to make inferences about the predictability
of your various reactions.

That someone would intend to use fear in this way is usually a warning
sign of a threatening situation, though using fear does have its
purposes. In situations where violence or deceit is in the wheelhouse,
you should immediately suppress the fight or flight response and
*project* a sense of being in control while you resort to cunning and
guile to get the fuck out. That is, you project that you already know
what you're going to do; you suppress saccadic movements of the eyes,
you consciously direct your attention to what you want them to react
to, but without setting off the threat. Their level of cognizance and
possible previous history of being in these situations will speak
volumes about how they expect to be able to use fear to coerce
disadvantageous responses from their subject. Use that knowledge to
your advantage. Know your enemy.

If they are cognizant, it will not be an accident that you are caught
in an intensely vulnerable situation. That there is one exit or that
your physical options and movement paths are limited or that you're
outnumbered or that you were emotionally riled up or were probed for
vulnerability and/or profit potential (e.g. in violent theft) -- none
of these factors will be accidental. Therefore, control the
circumstances to ensure you avoid incidentally encountering vulnerable
situations and they will never initiate the situation you fear.
Further, after multiple attempts to place you in vulnerable
circumstances, you can intuit their cognizance to act ... more or
less. Unless it's a junkie or a spineless thief, if they know you've
had time to permute the circumstances and detect the nascent threat,
they won't act at all, without overwhelming motivation/power. Doesn't
mean they weren't thinking about it. And [limited] empathy with the
potential offender will tell you, they usually must have time to plan
what they're going to do. They've thought about it or they're
executing preconditioned behavior patterns and the potential for a
profitable situation emerged to trigger it. A junkie who owes money or
needs drugs is in the process of finding a victim.

As you juxtapose the circumstances, read their level of control to
reorient the situation back to what they imagined. If there are risks,
they've thought about controlling the risks and random perturbations
forces them into cognitive overdrive to reevaluate risk and
control. They can't act without letting you in: they have to be aware
of risk, as the situation develops and thus, their mind is toggling
between lizard brain and prefrontal cortex. If premeditated, they've
already committed the crime in their mind. This is also a risky
potential attack vector for you, since they assume you don't know what
they're planning. You can fuck with their head emotionally, but not
with the wrong type of offender.

Above all else, avoid these situations entirely. That means to probe
the minds of people you become involved with and examine past patterns
of behavior -- *before you need to react*. To respond, you need to
have already conditioned patterns that make you strong. Offenders,
sociopaths and psychopaths preying with fear will stay away from you
if you are strong or look like a problem. Unless they're psychotic and
irrational, then when they use fear, they are probing you intensely
for feedback to inform their next actions. This, unexpectedly, gives
you power over them (but can also backfire).

Using fear is like tricking someone into not using half their chess
pieces.
- Controlling a situation by focusing the mind of the adversary or
  victim towards the potential losses from mistakes and away from
  accurately evaluating the probabilities. This doesn’t work on
  someone if they are prepared, informed, strong, values-oriented or
  stupid. Like all other circumstances with risk, you have to
  disconnect yourself from the potential losses. Otherwise, you will
  develop a skewed perspective or attitude. Someone cognizantly using
  fear will try to skew the distribution of your potential
  responses. This makes all paths of action/reactions from the current
  state much more predictable. It’s like imagining potential enemy
  positions in an FPS map after shrinking the map in half, which makes
  strategy far more computable. Controlling outcomes for the better by
  making them more predictable can justify the use of fear.

- copy notes about configuration space/entropy for chess pieces?
  - (predicting an opponents moves by reasoning about "normal" board
    configurations for current and descendant board configurations)
    - this may provide a useful metaphor for explaing the
      "discontinuities" of life

# Machiavellian Δ(Love) and Δ(Fear)

- most people are unwisely averse to learning about the mechanics of
  fear/evil or even those of power. people who build power through
  darker means, like the projection of love/fear, necessarily must
  operate in darkness.
- for most people, this can delay the acquisition of the tools of
  power. worse, since they don’t understand fear as used in power
  tactics, their innocence has only served to butter them up as naïve
  victims.
- fear games our collective compulsion to seek security, typically
  defined by those engaging in threat construction.

### ⊗ (Power Tactics projecting force onto the fields of love & fear)

- (1) They prefer secrecy of method/intent
  - ...

- (2) This secrecy enables manipulation of information unknown to the
  individuals who can be most effectively controlled by power/fear
  when they find it difficult to name or reason about the
  threat(s). the phenomena, mechanics and dynamics are unconscious to
  them.

- (3) They retain the posture to lash back in many more ways than
  their adversaries or pawns feel comfortable engaging. adverseries
  and pawns have little confidence that they can resist without
  suffering reprisal that yields a net loss to their interests.

- (4) The game of fear is a pyramid scheme, levering influence over
  third parties, the mechanics/limitations for which neither your
  network nor your adversaries can understand/articulate/predict.

- (5) They systemically disrupt communication. In the past, it was
  sufficient to manipulate the geographic or physical
  positions/containment of your threats. What one subject/pawn learns,
  if they can’t communicate, then others cannot become conscious to
  the tools of power. it can also make the subjects afraid to
  innovate. this weakness to centralized, domestic power can quickly
  turn into systemic helplessness against external powers.

- (6) So the game of fear is like bluffing in poker: you win biggest
  when, despite a bad hand, you drive other players to
  miscalculate. you must understand enough about their state,
  cognitive processes and decision making to understand how to
  create/utilize doxastic leverage to force their hand. As long as you
  can pay out on your threats when people call your bluffs; if not you
  will quickly lose face and your credibility will require emotionally
  violent action to repair — if abusing fear is critical to your
  tactics and strategy.

- (7) most critically, you must know how to create and apply your
  leverage by systemically influencing the narratives and beliefs
  individuals create. doing so requires “cultivating an air of fear”
  -- you must understand how to create and persist informational
  asymmetries, which always requires social compartmentalization of
  information -- darkness. Darkness is not always benefit evil, good
  can also be strengthened or galvanized against evil in darkness.

# Gestalt Of Fear: The Outlines Between The Known And The Unknown

### People Fear What They Do Not Understand

- (1) if people fear what they do not understand … then why do they
  not fear society’s abundantly lacking understanding of the tactics
  of fear and power? they are conned into believing that in ignorance
  and darkness, they will be safe. when the only thing to fear is fear
  itself, then why don’t people reach for its antidotes: knowledge,
  righteousness, justice, truth, reason, self-sacrifice, but above all
  else *understanding applied to fear itself*

- (2) because until it’s too late for action, the society drunk on the
  influence of fear had mistaken supposed comfort or insurance against
  constructed threats as safety. They fear what gives them power over
  the tactics of fear. They thought they had comfort or insurance,
  foresight or strength.

- (3) such is typical because fear is intrinsically connected to
  confusion, complexity, confidence. Why? Fear, as a generalized
  tactic, only pays when misinformation yields invalidity and
  miscalculation. this confidence in safety is usually misplaced
  confidence in people, facts & circumstances. again, to abuse fear,
  those in power must socially compartmentalize information to
  cultivate informational asymmetries.

### Fear Of The Unnamed and Of The Unnameable

- one does not simply fear the unnamed, nor can they fear the
  unnameable, per se. the unnameable cannot be dissected. it is
  representationally similar in structure to problems of
  uncountability in math. while people have the chance to act, fear
  controls the range of actions they consider their perception of
  information systems distorts the apparent probabilities of
  consequences. because rising up requires self-sacrifice (which is
  meaningless when it can be systemically muted), they cannot
  accurately assess what the likelyhood of the adversaries' responses
  against them will be, especially given social compartmentalization
  of information. thus, because they fear the unnamed and especially
  the unnameable, those rising up are unwilling to apply
  leverage. lack of action contributes to statistical distortion of
  perceived probabilities of adversarial reaciton. you cannot gauge an
  adversaries strength, against whom you refuse to test
  engagement. therefore, they also lack experience in handling the
  consequences, so when they finally act, they ability to accurately
  foresee the first-order and second-order consequences of their
  actions, whereas their adversary who exploits the informational
  asymmetry persists their ability to see & understand the causal
  nature of their interactions with those whom they have subjugated.

- Lovecraft’s use of mixed narrative styles which expand the space of
  valid interpretations of narratives the reader must collapse,
  tending to expand uncertainty.
- This is contrasted by his exemplary style painted with a
  skeptical-rationalists palette in the early modern era. Rationalism,
  science and math (particularly developments in countability and
  complexity theory) should terrify us because they imply that
  humanity will never have solace from the darker aspects of the human
  condition if we are to quell the unmitigatable complexity of modern
  technology.

### fear of change and fear of the future

- people fear the future (especially now) because they fear change.
  - they try to guarantee the certainty and security of their meager
    plans in life.
  - when faced with rational extrapolations of societal development
    (which accelerate during the time of the singularity), they
    consciously and unconsciously cooperate to stymie the titration of
    that information into society to preserve things they way they are
    at the present time. if they fear it, it is because they either
    don't understand it or they do. if it's the latter and the
    phenomena or it's associated social dynamics will disrupt
    particular certainties of their livelihood or the security of
    their future, as the visualize it, then they react by attempting
    to slow down change.
    - when (these rational extrapolations) are almost certain, given
      enough time, then you can slow down the diffusion of
      information, but you cannot stop the precipitation of these
      phenomena. you may engage in disruption to slow down change in
      an attempt to control things, but if you don't also determine
      the change's inevitability and also prepare for the transition
      from a system that fought against the change into one that must
      accept it, (then you're a fool.)
      - can phenomena which manifest with almost never probability
        (but do manifest) then create consequences whose effects are
        delayed but have almost certain probability?

### fear of intelligence

- people try to suppress the diffusion of difficult-to-reach
  (logically reachable) rational implications of novel epistemological
  developments.

  - the degree by which these rational extrapolations are difficult to
    reach (and hence require more intelligence) is the degree by which
    people resist them, accounting for the apparent associated change
    that accompanies them. if an idea is easy to reach, but implies
    large change, then it is reasonable to assume that the idea will
    spontaneously manifest in society at high rates. thus, attempts to
    control the dispersion of those ideas pay off less. when an idea
    is difficult to reach, it can be assumed that almost no one will
    think of similar things and hence, the payoff for slowing its
    spread will be higher. the higher the capacity for intelligence
    that someone has and the more disruptive their applications of
    their intelligence are, the more resistance and mob-mentality they
    will encounter. people can easily be made to fear their ability to
    disrupt the status quo and whether that disruption is positive or
    negative matters very little, for the average person cannot
    comprehend the inner workings of the highly intelligent person's
    mind. for two intelligent people 3σ or higher, they suffer similar
    inabilities to understand the inner workings of each others minds,
    even if they have the same level of intelligence. they may be able
    more easily understand the products of each other's intelligence
    than the average person, but face similar difficulties
    understanding the workings of each others mind.

    - because people fear the unknown and because they cannot know
      what intelligent people are thinking or may be capable of
      thinking, they fear intelligence, especially if they are aware
      of their own inadequacies. even if you are intelligent, there is
      little you can do against social disconnection or extreme
      information assymetries. but a person who may develop
      intelligence who is constantly subjected to a state of social
      isolation will perhaps respond by further strengthening their
      intelligence by identify connections in social information
      systems that other people are likely to miss. they do this to
      survive.

- the torment of the intelligent and the society’s need to punish them
  for revealing secrets is exemplified by the eternal castigation of
  Prometheus.

- TODO: include the ideas on how the definition of intelligence is a
  measure of the expansion of paths/cliques over a graph(?)

# [So What Is The Answer?]()

- define justice and altruism in the confucian sense.
  - contrast the definition of justice with the Platonic defintion of
    justice (from the Republic)
  - connect this sociophysical definition of fear/love to the
    implications of it's sociological implications
  - how do the balance of fear and love impact the collective
    projection of individual's attention? how should fear and love be
    used to direct our attention towards what is needed for justice
    (to take place), both inside and outside of our country?

- to strengthen altruism, we need to become one, to think as one, to
  unify values (that should be elevated)
  - what motivates individuals to act with altruistic motivation?
    - why is justice critical for this? (i.e. why act altruistically
      if your society has a twisted sense of justice or does not
      permit justice to occur?)
    - without justice, the potential for altruism is weakened. without
      the desire for to cultivate and empower altruistic values, the
      rule of law is impaired and the spirit by which we enforce the
      law is tainted.


- If social engineers leverage the fields of love/fear to modulate
  attention sociophysically, a potential systemic tail risk arises
  when the force of fear tends to expand the space of the unknown. We
  fear what we don’t understand, but if there is systematic aversion
  of attention away from what we fear, the frequency of doxastic
  updates slows to a crawl. That is, when it changes for better or
  worse, people don’t stay apprised of whether a threat that should be
  feared has quickly grown stronger.

- breakdown the terminology in the question
  - specify that we is meant in the general sense

- Iching's response: [Coming to Meet

  - the response is very relevant to the topics in the question

### Coming to Meet (44)

- image "under heaven, the wind blows"
  - cover the elemental symbolism here.

- this hexagram underscores the need to normalize the value systems
  that incentivize behavior in our society.

- line 3:
  - "no skin on his thighs"

- line 5:
  - hidden lines & melon drops down to one from heaven

### Conquering Fear Itself

- focus atttention away from disorder & chaos and toward order and
  potential for action. however, not so much so that you completely
  lose touch with information about changes in these areas of your
  society, for two reasons: (1) this is where evolution is occuring so
  changes here need to be propagated to the regions of order (2) you
  never want to lose sight of a threat. you must engage threats with
  some level of continuous awareness. when you lose situational
  awareness on a threat, that's when developments and dynamics occur
  that will catch you by surprise.
  - it is for these reasons that the threat is braked, the fish is in
    the tank and walking comes hard.
  - but many components of the discord and disorder in society are not
    threats and should not be treated as such. instead, they should
    have their energy transformed so that it is beneficial to society
    (explain...), without affecting their inner nature.
  - you don't want to affect someone's nature if it is their true
    nature and they are not harming other people.

### Before Completion (64)

- describe the notion of a systems current order and it's manifested
  forms in terms of the relationships between chinese characters for
  water (水), ice (氷) and eternity (永)

- only the values and systems in society that have attained
  normification can be depended upon as certain for calculation. when
  there is significant overlap in normalized values systems and
  information systems in society, a kind of convergence occurs that
  makes it easier to strategize.
  - elaborate on how this relates to furthering justice
    - i.e. if a new order is established and we don't have power, then
      we may not be able to conduct domestic policy justly
      - or we may find ourselves with few options and forced to act
        out of necessity, less capable of acting altruistically or
        inline with our values in foreign affairs.

- we have the opportunity to influence this emerging order now and
  less so once it materializes. our enemies want to foment discord
  within our borders, so that our attention and energy will be focused
  on tearing ourselves apart. we will focus on narratives
  corresponding to the recent past instead of the change accomplished
  by past generations. we will focus on only the immediate present,
  instead of the future. we will forget news stories from months
  before. if we only focus on the present, we cannot guarantee a
  secure transition to a future over which we have influence. once the
  objects of fear are determined by our enemies, they determine the
  how the subjects orient their attention, energy and time.

  - we have to resist this and (socially engineer) love and fear to
    focus ourselves outwards, so that we secure our economic
    externalities and thus have more flexibility to maneuver as the
    next emerging order establishes itself.

- when fear causes individuals and people to become isolated, this
  impacts the flows of information.
  - "fellowship with men" teaches that it is easier to stay together
    than to come together, but that it's easier to factionalize during
    times of change than either of the former.

- segue from discussing the "emerging order" to discussing
  machiavelli's ideas on the formation of regimes (not necessarily
  "hard" regime change)
  - the challenges to new or transitionary regimes and how the
    specifics of events during transition and of power structures near
    the top effect the regime's stability, determine its upcoming
    challenges and set in course [various factors] -- "big shoes to
    fill"
    - explain that these seemingly diverse types of consequences
      stemming from the specifics of choices made during the time of
      transition mostly extend from how norms propagate through
      society after the transition and how normative values
      incentivize behavior and how normative beliefs shape reality by
      shaping expectation.
    - after regime change, the stability and varability of information
      systems which become established pave the road forward by
      shaping the expectations of the people and fixing the range of
      beliefs which can be extrapolated to from what is considered
      normal. the degree of volatility in the normative dynamics of
      information systems relevant to political calculation signals
      the potential for disruption after the establishment of a new
      order. herein, it is what is considered normal to believe that
      shape the statistical expectations and people look to what can
      be assumed to be certain to make calculations in economic and
      social spheres. without certainty, no assumptions can be made
      and no one can cooperate.
    - whether the people can be coaxed to resonate with the new
      normative dynamics of the political regime or whether they must
      forced to do so results in the emergence of specific types of
      consequences. if it is necessary to suppress dissent or revolt
      harshly or if the regime came to power by playing factions into
      betraying one another (as with leninism), then the regime must
      deal with the specific consequences arising thereof. in these
      cases, a legacy of suppression of dissent will be necessary,
      especially in times of economic decline where it is not possible
      to placate the people with access to wealth and economic
      opportunity. but if the people can control the course of the
      changes into a system they can embrace, they can shape it into
      something that lasts. this results when there is leadership that
      exerts magnetism over the people, fomenting the emergence of
      fealty towards the new leaders.
