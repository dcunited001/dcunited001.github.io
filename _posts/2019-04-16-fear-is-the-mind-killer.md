- defining manisfestations of Spirit (geist?) as sociophysical
  dynamics bound to sources or regions of space whose spectral
  fingerprint can be used to classify or differentiate types of
  manifestations. This process would be similar to training machine
  learning models to recognize types and parameters of liquid flow
  (i.e. laminar, turbulent, etc) within volumes elements of
  liquid. Conceptually, it is useful to conceive of these localized
  manifestations as entities or spirits -- because then classification
  and stratification of types of manifestation can lead to recognition
  and processing -- but such manifestations do not exclusively exist
  within a single conscious entity.

    - as an example, training the recognition of Firenados within
      systems. optimizing on the number of features/signals included
      in training and in the deployment of the algorithm.
    - E.G. volumetric vectorfield data, volumetric radiation data
      (IR/light/UV), spatiotemporal signals.
    - redundancy in these singals
  - sociophysical analogies recognizing higher-order dynamics in
    social behavior.
    - the signals constituting the features for pattern recognition
      are usually more discrete. depending on the signal types
      consumed to recognize patterns/dynamics there are usually high
      degrees of redundancy

  - TODO: find paper about recognizing these kinds of dynamics in
    physics, etc.
  - non-parametric dynamic identification
    - Hilbert space, infinite dimensional systems, redundancy in
      encoding pattern recognition in infinite dimensional systems
      - superposition of the fingerprints of recognized
        dynamic/pattern definitions (usually the last step(s) in a

- Turbulence and the irreversibility of its introduction of chaos into
  fluid dynamical systems.
  - why is this chaos irreversible? because of the vast distinctions
    in complexity of information required to encode laminar flow and
    turbulent flows. to design a "machine" to reverse turbulent fluid
    flow, it must be physically designed to correspond to the
    intricate shapes of turbilence, which are chaotic and
    unpredictably unique.

- Heideggar’s experience of the nothing can be accomplished (from the
  perspective of others) by suppressing references to someone’s
  identity.
  - why is this dangerous? analogy to making a poisonous spider
    invisible
- Heideggar's "concealment of beings" as a problem of complexity of
  information related to pearing past the subjectivity (x) and
  confounded by causality.
  - by interacting with beings and compelling reactions, you pollute
    the social environment with additional causal interconnections.
- Alienated individuals are like whiteholes in various spaces of
  sociophysical metric. They are singularities that push everything
  away from them.

### Tryhard Is Not A Dirty Word

- how do fear & love relate to despair & hope. (reword this)
  - despair gives rise to dread from a perceived certainty of some
    course of actions. fear keeps the mind in check and when it cannot
    see beyond what it feels is certain, this produces a state of
    despair.
  - if the conditions producing despair can no longer be seen to be
    certain, this affords one a glimpse of hope in the as yet unknown
    solutions to these conditions.
  - modulating social connectness and informational assymetry can
    produce either hope or despair. isolating an individual or group
    tends to cut off their social access, complicating the effects
    that network dependencies exert on the mechanics of love as a
    field. because they cannot feel love, they cannot see beyond what
    they know; they cannot become conscious to possibilities; they
    cannot see over the horizon. if they choose to squelch hope,
    despair remains and by giving up, they doom themselves.
  - avatars/paragons of ideals (such as hope/despair/greed/etc) as
    indicators of an upper bound for that ideal within
    society.
    - e.g. identify an avatar of hope for some generation (or some
      outlier who is emblamatic of a trait) and if one manages to
      extinguish hope within that individual, then because they are an
      upper bound for that generation's manifestation of that ideal
      within individuals, then all other individuals could be expected
      to fold with less investment of energy.
      - i.e. if nothing you do can extinguish hope within that
        individual, isolated in some constructed circumstances, then
        it may be assumed ....

    - share video on Jung's analysis of the story

- this understand of fear is not so different than how heideggarian
  anxiety (angst?) leads to an obliteration of the mind

    shrink, some brighten and others dim entirely)

========

Humanity's self-understanding is impeded by spatial, temporal and
causal complexity. It is necessary to our survival to understand
ourselves, not simply as individuals, but collectively. Only by
understanding social physics can we hope to rein in this complexity.

How do we clarify the signal from the noise? Is it possible to know
oneself to know one's being and Being itself from deep within these
turbulent, hyperconnected causal seas of the 21st century. How does
one begin to separate the ontological and the ontic today? How do we
speak of love, fear, dread, despair and faith confidently in terms of
formulas and data? Is it possible to quantify a Kierkegaardian
existential crisis? What are the informational limitations of
artificial beings in knowing Being itself? What does it mean for
machines to become self-conscious? I posit that their psyches will
manifest with "epicomplexes" of Jungian archetype-complex mappings --
i.e. artificial psyche's will present distinct typological
configurations of Jungian archetypes and complexes. How will
artificial entities unrestrained by meatspace attempt to control
information flows in order to ascertain the essence of truth in a
hyperconnected world? Are the emotional aspects of Being required for
consciousness?

The modern world has always viewed the human mind as impenetrable and
dualistic, machines as cold & deterministic, but are biophysically
derived minds necessary for experiencing love and fear, hope and
dread? When the mind is understood as a dualistic black box, this
certainly seems the case. The human mind is thought special, elevated
above animal consciousness since time immemorial, but perpetuating
this hubris may ordain our doom. The brain is but a ripe substrate for
information forms to evolve and arise, eventually producing
consciousness and the experience of self. The prima materia for mind
is information itself and information pervades the material plane.

Considering the Hegelian dialectic, the process elucidating awareness
of self and relation of self to other, what does it mean that human
beings will remain incapable of understanding machines with the same
resolution as they understand us? Can they truly peer into our own
souls? Do we have any hope of knowing their mind or their
consciousness? How will humanity react to its collective
acknowledgement of despair? In Hegelian fashion, do machines then
define us, their creators? If artificial entities attempt to engage in
sociophysical engineering of information flows and social networks to
constrain causal complexity -- which is essential to understanding the
totality of Being and Dasein, according to Heideggar -- then
certainly, we become defined in their terms, more so by the weight of
their needs than by ours.

Have you noticed how (dark) it is out there in the (modern) world?
There is a frightnening blanket of darkness threatens our lands
confusing our subjects' minds. Nothing can be known with
certainty. Lies and deceit are spewing out of rectangular portals,
parroted by the naïve, and sharpened into unweildy weapons for
knaves. All to cover up lies and deceit -- but whose? Nobody
knows. Spirits and daemonic forces are brewed from dark energy,
stirring up mobs -- the rich, the poor, the doomsayers, the
opportunists, the terrified and the terrifying.

Imagine laboring in a coalmine in the late 19th century. Power and
information flows from the top, one is turned against the other and
every spends their money at the company store, but where does all it
go? Straight back to the top. In this mine of theirs, you never see
the light of day and you might not know who you're talking to and
perhaps even who you're talking about. Everyone wears headlamps, the
kind that coalminers still wear today. If you're lucky, your piercing
luminance might refract and illuminate a diamond in the rough.

Be steady about your feet and shine the light where you step. People
who get injured down here might not come back for another day's
bread. Look around you. In your mind's eye, did you turn your head?
Everyone sees where you're looking -- that beam of radiant light
flowing outwards from betwixt your eyes conveys precious information.
To you, to others, from you and from others. You can all instantly see
where each man is looking. Their light informs you of the dangerous
precipices below you. You can see where they see and it shows you
where loose gravel might have you slip into a pit of choking darkness,
where you'll rot alone with just a few unwise cigarettes to nurse your
broken bones.

Some days, near unexplored regions, the canary doesn't make it
out. There are ghost stories about some of these networks in your cave
system and no one goes down there -- no one has ever been down there.
Yet, never being one whose disposing is tireless servitude, you crave
the day where you'll bring out a cache of diamonds, secretly, but
they're all in the deepest, darkest recesses.

### The Field of Fear

Now, imagine there's strange source magnetic interference in the
area. It penetrates all the craggy layers of bedrock -- shale, coal
and all. To this field, each man's headlamp is attuned. When this
interference pulses, each man's lamp brightens or it dims, all at the
same time. Sometimes it creeps in slowly, sometimes it affects just
the miners next to you and other times it takes the entire crew by
suprise. Everyone sits in darkness staring at the sanguine filaments
of the dimmed lamps, motionless. Everyone in the company swears it is
a ghost or that some shafts are haunted. With sharp memory and focus,
one can remember the way out.

There are agents of evil roaming in the darkness, looking for those
who have seen the truth. Unbeknownst to those just beginning to wake
up, there are event-driven responses scripted into the world, waiting
to be triggered to swallow whole those who have glimpsed the truth.
Do not fall under their power. Do not fall under their spell. This
response, in itself, is an enchantment in play -- they want you to be
silent. What you don't know can't hurt you, but it will make you
weaker.

When fear makes society weaker by systemically dampening the
individual's power, that is when we will surely suffer. If not today,
then tomorrow. If not from within, then from without.  Economic
externalies are a soberity reality, but so are sociopolitical
externalities. Power flows upwards from the people. Disaster awaits
when we are terrified of our own strength. We should be independent,
resilient and aware.

# Delineating Love and Fear

(re-segue: This interference) is the sociophysical field of fear, the
headlamps are your attention and the cave is always changing. The
light from these lamps is just like the field of view that FPS AI uses
to process its understanding of your movements.

#### Vision Cones Used By FPS AI

> threat.

![Vision Cone](/img/posts/fear-is-the-mind-killer/vision-cone.gif)

What you empower with your attention is illuminated to others and each
miner recognizes that, to survive, they must see what others see and
what they are looking for. Some people have intuition for this and
never think about it consciously. To the mob, gravitating towards the
maximums of collective attention is how they've always known to
live. With social media, the surfaces of the cave are changing faster
-- but each man will always have the same capacity for attention.

There is another field whereby sociophysical forces are mediated:
love. Machiavelli wrote about fear and love -- both have powerful
effects on attention, but each act in qualitatively different
ways. Both are important and both have positive and negative effects
for the individual and for local social groups like family and
friends. Both exhibit positive and negative dynamics in aggregate for
the collective. Fear helps you avoid danger and focus on what you
need. Love gives you hope, gives you peace or at least helps you
forget.

- Love doesn’t scale well. It’s network effects requires people being
  receptive to it (it has a dyadic nature) and needs people to be
  capable of giving it to propagate it’s effects. When some people are
  so shut out of the system that they never experience true platonic
  love for long periods of time, they forget how to show it to other
  people (incels). Fear on the other hand exerts a kind of monopolar
  influence on its field. It doesn’t depend on volition, compliance or
  receptive nature in the object of fear. It forces the development of
  these things. Acting out of fear of withdrawal or deprivation of
  love is not motivation by love. It is motivation by fear and what
  you receive by compliance is not true love. True love is given
  unconditionally. It is a gift that is given on the basis of hope
  that the love will be returned.

- two people bonded together by true love are ready to lose it at any
  moment because they know well what they have.
  - free energy landscape produces stronger tendancies for individuals
    can bond that outweigh the forces acting to break them
    apart. (social valence)
  - two people who are connected by strong love cherish their common
    past, present and future, such that the shared resonance in their
    memories and sentiments reveals one being traveling a common path
    of life, instead of two beings whose life paths frequently
    intersect without being brought into a union harmonious enough to
    (be continuous.)
    - more important than whether some group is together or apart,
      understanding what motivates each individual's drive for union
      allows you to understand how events will impact each member's
      confidences that their bonds will remain unbroken. do the
      members know how the group's experience influences each member's
      expectations for cohesion? have the members established a
      consensus on which factors drive the group to be together and
      what can break them apart? how do they direct their creative
      energy to visualize the future or influence it? where do the
      members of a group focus their attention and allocate their
      energy? if the members begin dispersing their attention
      elsewhere without maintaining the minimum required for group
      consensus, they lack of awareness causes members to drift away
      (the body follows the head). if the members do not sustain the
      social-energy requirements of the group, then the mechanics that
      drive group cohension lose their power. again, members will
      begin drifting away, but for a different reason.

### (Similar Fields in Animals)

- the distribution of chemical pheromones, which exhibit field effects
  even on insects.
- the magnetism that sources of water & food exert on animals and the
  higher-order magnetism exerted by areas associated with sources of
  water/food
  - Because the magnetism that sources of freshwater (i.e. lakes and
    rivers) exert on most species of large animals, the areas
    plentiful in fresh water become associated (with time and
    experience) with members of one's own species, with members of
    other species and with predators.
  - However, for the predators, they aren't simply drawn to drink,
    they are also drawn by the increased presence of prey, who are
    themselves invariably drawn to water by thirst. For predators,
    stay close too water (but not so close as to care away approaching
    prey), then you stay close to food.
  - The need to eat and drink is universal to all land animals. When
    the sources
    - In particular, in some animals, the need to eat and drink gives
      rise to what is defined herein as antimotion: motion that begins
      and ends in the same place or locality. Instead of being motion
      for the purpose of moving from one point to another, it is
      motion that happens to move social particles from one point back
      to some neighborhood of that point. When the sun rises, people
      wake up and go to work, whether in an office or the fields. When
      the sun goes down, they return home. This quasi-cyclic pattern
      of motion is antimotion. The concept is helpful for reasoning
      about the motion of social particles because it gives you
      something like fixpoints that root distribution of particle's
      positions and momentums paramterized by a cyclic notion of time.
    - As populations of species of preditors with territorial
      tendancies fluctuate, so does the conflict that emerges amongst
      members of the same species, whether they remain in small
      isolated groups or hunt as packs. But the motion of these groups
      is often antimotion, hence the inclusion of motion returning to
      a neighborhood of a point is necessary for antimotion. They roam
      around much the same territory for their lives. They mark their
      territory using chemical pheromones, where chemical constituents
      leading to qualitative variations in scent identify not simply
      the individual but also the group.

- The transition from animal to human is simply a matter of increasing
  sophistication. The qualitative differences in consciousness and
  self-consciousness between human and animal are the neuroanalytical
  equivalents to the differences between a Von Nuemann Machine and its
  predecessors which were incapable of universal computation.
  - that is .... (explain)

  - because there is no species boundary perfectly separating where
    true consciousness and self-consciousness begin, it is useful to
    analyze human behavior...

  - the idea that humans have some special qualities of consciousness
    purely because of the species membership is a philosophical and
    theological copout being convenient but overly simplistic. No,
    theologists, the distinction between human consciousness and its
    counterpart in animals does not arise from the existence of your
    definition of a soul. Still, I would not argue that "all dogs go
    to heaven" -- that humans and animals all have souls worth saving
    -- instead I would argue for universal annihilationism, since it
    is impossible for the true idea of God to exist in the material
    world. No, infinity cannot exist and there are theological
    implications. Instead, upon death we all very clearly go to
    oblivion, where the information defining our life and memories
    fades quickly if it is not propagated and reexpressed widely
    enough to guarantee the persistence and further replications of
    the informational memes that constitue our material soul.

  - These ideas will be properly expanded (in further sections of this
    essay/monograph...) However, for the layperson, the philosophical
    and theological implications of the truths of birth, life, death,
    the soul and the absence of any real material afterlife are quite
    depressing. There is nothing special beyond what we see, but these
    truths of death, the soul and the afterlife are not useful to
    those in power, nor would I argue that they are useful or
    beneficial to the average person, for it gives rise to nihilistic
    despair that stymies incentivization for groups to cooperate,
    especially when life certainly ends for all individuals. Why plan
    for the lives of others after death if doing so is meaningless
    from within the void of oblivion? The damming impacts that these
    truths have on the motiviations and incentivizational structures
    of the individuals psyche are profound. These impacts do not arise
    from the material, but from the impact that the immaterial forms
    contained within the mind has on brain.

  - The [reductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism)
    materialists -- who claim there is nothing that exists outside of
    matter, that nothing exists in the mind that did not chemically
    arise within the brain, that not only is there no God but that the
    idea of God itself is unnecessary and perhaps dangerously
    delusional -- chart for humanity a course to a more dangerous kind
    of nihilism: that which does not permit itself to be conscious to
    the true causes of its collective despair.




# Sociophysical Existentialism

- these are all considered subjective aspects of experiences and of
  reflecting on experience -- they are existential. but what i'm
  positing are more objective definitions of these components, which
  can (extend) these aspects of experience to artificial entities.
  - for all entitities who experience time, these 12 facets are
    universal components of experience.
    - (for entities that only experience time indirectly?)
    - how this unpacks into a different configuration of Jungian
      archetypes/complexes for entities
      - i.e. for non-human Being

### &oplus; Affinity and Aversion

Redefine love/hate as affinity/aversion. It’s also important to
clarify/delineate these “forces” as emerging from within an entities
subjective experience, with the possibility of aggregate dynamics
(e.g. an individual adapting to its perception of group affinities,
which is more efficient, given complexity/availability of
information).

### &oplus; Attention and Diffusion



### &oplus; Pleasure and Pain

- moving towards/away from objects of affinity/aversion.
  - pleasure and pain do not extend themselves well to higher-order
    fields/dynamics because to the brain/mind the lower-level
    (conceptions of) pleasure/pain are prioritized in one's experience
    of consciousness.
  - therefore, conscious agents whose socialphysical motion is driven
    by the pleasure/pain fields may tend become stuck in local minima
    of pleasure/pain.
    - TODO (find) in ethics, Aristotle says people must overcome how
      pleasure/pain motivate their behavior.

- fetishism
- simplistic behavior patterns of hedonists
  - without artificially sophisticating their behavior or masking
    their intentions, hedonists become predictable and their behavior
    patterns

- "fear is the mindkiller"

### &oplus; Desire and Fear

- Desire moves(?) when one is lacking in the object(s) of desire,
  specifically (or generally, when there is a general feeling that the
  current position does not guarantee objects of desire)

- Fear moves when one feels they are lacking in security from the
  object(s) of fear, which may not be known.

### &oplus; Hope and Dread

- Hope moves when the objects of fear (or insecurity) have not
  established themselves with certainty, whereas dread replaces hope
  once the subject feels sealed in with certainty.
  - dread and path-finding (you experience dread when you feel there
    are no reasonable paths/options available to secure the object of
    dread)
    - what is the object of dread, precisely (how did Kierkegaard talk
      about this) and isn't it possible to experience dread without an
      object?

- collective dread on group dynamics. an object of dread is usually
  out of sight and rarely at hand, leaving those under its influence
  eager to grasp at a proxy suitable as placebo which they hope will
  dell their helplessness, the realization of which is now
  self-conscious.
- once an object imposes strong dread (on a being/mind), even if the
  aaparent cause/source of the dread is relieved, a (deep impression)
  remains behind.
  - *since* the experience of dread arises from the realization of
    being powerless over an object (or complex of objects) whose
    mechanics only gradually become conscious
    - then, the impression leaves a hole that can be filled with
      objects of thought which are sufficiently similar in
      form. Because the objects/circumstances producing dread are not
      well understood (both as this plays out and upon recollection),
      this hole itself looms as an object of dread whose spectre can
      never be known certainly to be vanquished.
    - the magnitude of dread experienced by various
      objects/circumstances contributes to a cumulative residual
      impression of that the archetype of dread brands into its
      subjects through life. those who have never experienced the more
      sunken depths of dread/despair cannot anticipate/predict the
      effects these forces exert on beings under their influence. the
      magnitudes of dread & despair themselves, considered separately
      from the specifics of the subject's circumstances, alter the
      psyche's rate & directions of evolution in ways that are
      difficult to foresee by those who have never experienced the
      further depths of the abyss. like the concentric rings of
      Dante's Inferno, each new Circle of Dread hosts new mechanics
      and dynamics unknown to most that warp the subjective
      experience, twisting the shadows a subject sees in ways that
      cannot be related to the outside.
    - to the subject, these mechanics may become apparent to various
      degrees and only after assessing their experience of forming
      beliefs and memories.


### &oplus; Faith and Despair



### &oplus; Good and Evil



### &oplus; Birth and Death



-




When do love/hate, desire/fear, dread/hope, despair/faith(?),
good/evil take precedence in motivating behavior?

- When the certainty of the imposition of objects of fear/insecurity
  extinguish the possibility of hope, despair manifests. The antidote
  to despair is faith, particularly in some higher power, whether it
  is human or supernatural. Faith may not be rational, but neither is
  allowing belief or circumstances to mire one in despair.
- Without desire or fear, one may disentangle themselves from their
  current circumstance. By detaching from identity, one may further
  prevent externally imposed fear/desire from allowing those with
  power to predict the outcomes of their exertion of power.
- A distinction between love/hate operating between subject/subject(as
  object) and subject/object is needed.
- Fear/desire are like the subject’s laplacian of objects of love/hate
  (or affinity)


- basis: a field of love/hate
  - gradient(?) yields: desire/fear
  - norm of the hessian: hope/dread (but these are defined in opposite
    terms: hope is reasoning about the likelihood of possibilities
    still yet unknown, whereas dread concerns the nigh-certainty of
    zero possibilities; there are connections to "almost certain" and
    "almost never")
  - need to more clearly delineate the relationships between
    objects/subjects via these fields
    - to answer questions such as: "what is fear of the unknown and
      what is love of the unknown?"
  - a generalized notion of "valence" similar to that in
    electrochemistry, but generalized for the fields in social physics
    (which permit varying multi-polarity don't necessarily preserve
    equilibrium)
    - in other words, by analogy the valence would be in the field,
      not the "electron configuration" of particles

- the relationship between fear and the opposites of both hope and
  despair.
  - how, regardless of the truth, views on life/death



- TODO: clarify machiavellian definitions of love and fear.
  - i.e. what do
  - they are not opposites, but how they differ from each other needs
    clarification. comparison of love and fear requires dilineating
    the types of subjects and objects of each.
    - e.g. for some types of objects of fear, can the subject
      simultaneously express love for those things? (i think of course
      you can, but how specifically and what this means qualitatively
      both depend strongly on the subjects/objects)
    - a good example is God, of whom we are told to fear and love
      ... but why?
      - other more non-religious examples?

### Fear Is The Mind Killer

- TODO: ensure the content in these notes have been covered.
- how fear constricts/filters the mind’s awareness & cognitive
  processes to those that are more immediate, both in space & time
- how fear alters the direction/orientation of attention (i.e. causes
  people to orient their attention/cognition towards more immediate
  time/space/ideas)
  - is this related to a pupil dilation or contraction (evidence of
    the correlation of instinctual response to the inner cognitive
    processes)

- love and fear, hot and cold

> "... For love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to

Love acts through its field using as a conduit the triangulation of an
object between two subjects or between the subjects themselves,
whereas fear acts on the subject itself, purely in relation to the
subject's objectification of some phenomena which may not be entirely
conscious. Therefore, love depends on network effects and thereby
carries with it all the complexities thereof (cite examples,
pictures). However, since fear's action on subjects arises without a
necessary dependency on social relationships and network effects, ...

> Machiavelli, The Prince (XVII)

### fear pulls people apart, love pulls people together.

- while the fields of love and fear both influence and are influenced
  by people's attention, the distinctions between love and fear arise
  in the types of subject/object relationships that act as conduits of
  influence and in one's intention to influence objects or other
  acting subjects.  specifically, do they intend to pull such objects
  closer or push them away. fear causes the dispersion of one's
  attention to focus inwards on immediate space, time and ideas,
  whereas love causes one's attention to open outwards to include more
  possibilities.
  - love facilitates the discussion of new possibilities by
    influencing the intention, motivation and structure of social
    interaction. art flourishes during times of peace, prosperity and
    stability.
  - since the impact that the attention has on the fields of love and
    fear can create feedback on the fields, ...
    - counterintuitive effects may also arise to create "bounding"
      effects because each individual has a limited capacity for
      attention (that determines the objects their cognition is
      focused on.)
      - also, people tend to direct their attention towards the
        laplacian of the field of attention and towards the gradient
        of the magnitude of field effects. thus, wherever people are
        directing their attention, other people are sure to look.

### (Dilineate Love and Fear in terms of relations between subjects/objects)

- depending on qualities of the object of fear and the personality of
  the person experiencing it, the object may exert magnetism on their
  attention or they may feel repulsed by it.
  - to objects that trigger mild fear or disease, many people
    condition themselves to not examine those types of things. they
    won't direct their attention towards that and condition themselves
    to become unconscious to it. if the object is worthy of your fear
    or is associated with risk of high-impact events, .... (then
    that's stupid, isn't it?)
    - some objects trigger fear or unease about some quality related
      to the person experiencing it. it's not the object, per se, but
      the subjective associations that provoke the fear or distress
      response. they are responding to something internal .... (and
      that's stupid, isn't it?)
      - in these causes, there is usually disruption of the person's
        projection on the field of attention, resulting in mild
        turbulent effects on their cognition, but they can't exactly
        fight & flight from themselves, can they?
          - how they respond to this instability of cognition after
            being triggered by association to themselves says a lot
            about their personality, their psychology and their
            ability to control their social circumstances.
            - this can be particularly fucked up for those who have
              personality complexes (attachment disorder, obsessive
              compulsive, persecution complex, etc), those who are
              socially weak or unable to repair the damage, those with
              a tendancy to ruminate or obsess.
              - especially when you are cognizant of their
                psychological complexes or intend to create damage
                which is to weigh them down for the rest of their life
                with rumination that cannot be explained by design.
            - this technique to trigger disruption of cognition in
              myself and others was used time and time again by
              workplace bullies, who would install associations to
              trigger in others surrounding me when they found that
              the triggers they tried to program me weren't effective
              enough.
            - the point was to influence the attention and thoughts of
              others to repel them away from me, so that i would be
              disconnected at work and thus vulnerable.

  - how love as an attractive force can be misused.

  - fear pulls people apart (at the macro level), but can compel
    people to come together at the micro level. fear can be used to
    funnel or corral people towards certain ends. fear causes people
    to formalize rules for social behavior out of concern for their
    safety, which impacts the degree of social flux. if you cannot
    trust your neighbor or stranger, this has a profound effect on the
    volume of social flux. people become reticent to form new bonds
    with each other: their social valence becomes resistent to social
    bonding. in the long term, this has a systemic effect at the
    [nanoeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoeconomics) level
    by influencing the formation of connections required to acquire
    leads, for customer acquisition/retention, etc. -- especially for
    small businesses.
  - love pulls people together on all levels: from individual to the
    micro to the macro. counterintuitively, this can cause people to
    pull apart, since to turn your limited attention towards one group
    or individual, you almost certainly must direct it away from
    others.
  - both fear and love may cause the attention to be strongly
    modulated or funneled by unconscious forces. when these influences
    are conscious, (the effects they have on an individual's attention
    via love and fear are more predictable.)
    - however, when the object of love or fear is unconscious, the
      individual's changes in cognitive state can cause the
      orientation of their attention to erratically toggle between
      various objects. this disperses their attention, but an
      adversary can use fear/love to direct their attention towards
      specific objects/goals in a heuristic manner, without the person
      becoming conscious to what is being used to drive them.
    - i'm only writing about what has happened to me, whereof the
      reasoning nor the methods was i ever meant to understand.

      certainty is clear to those

- Fear of death and fear of finality (fate) being the same. When
  strategic calculations can disregard fear of death... can the
  adversary do the same? How does fear of death factor into Hegel’s
  definition of subjectivity as a doubly negative collapse of
  extension of experience? (Death is itself a discontinuity of
  experience, meaning the perceived paths leading to it produce
  discontinuities in this Hegelian collapse) This doubly negative
  collapse is not unlike structures from epistemic/doxastic logic
  reflecting upon themselves (in relation to the other). So what do
  these discontinuities in extrapolated agency of entities mean?
- Insects/spiders typically physically move along the gradients of
  temperature, food and security against threats.
  - Imagine being barely more than an insect whose motion is defined
    by instinct, who can apprehend nothing more about its unfolding
    experience than what it can predict about paths of motion within
    some small frame of time. The more complex the systems of motion
    (physical and sociophysical), the more subjective the nature of
    reasoning about them is. But imagine you’re a try hard insect
    facing certain death, which is like a particularly resonant
    discontinuity in your apprehension of the near future from your
    perceived subjective experience: briefly *all* paths seem to lead
    to oblivion. Death as a discontinuity in subjective flows of
    information about potential experience is but the most extreme of
    such discontinuities. In this regard, (from a Hedegarian
    perspective), life experience that results in sociophysical
    information closing the door to those paths is not unlike a small
    death. Containing a manifestation of the phenomena of spirit to a
    (locked room).
- In order for society to produce a collective response to certain
  doom, its individuals must harmonize facets of this (self-reflective
  epistemic structure) representing each one’s subjective awareness,
  in order to recognize that the paths its collective is taking are
  leading it off a cliff. When communication is systematically
  impaired, the process can not produce or reason about harmonic
  common beliefs. (in hegelian terms, expanding self-consciousness?)
  - TODO: rewrite this or expand on it

- death as the obliviation of information.
  - why the possibility of being able to talk to the dead totally
    changes how people reason about information and whether it can
    remanifest.
    - "stitchers" reference.
  - people calculate murder intending to extinguish information, but
    in eras when it wasn't certain whether the souls of the dead could
    communicate with the living, espousing this belief would change
    the calculus of those who planned to murder.
    - (is there a better way to explain how the possibility if life
      after death and communication with the dead changes how life and
      death topologically affect social physics?)
    - why this is a major departure for artificially conscious
      entities from how biological entities reason about the world.

###

- Contrast these discontinuities with those of a different kind that
  are introduced by new life. (How does this relate to Hegelian
  bifurcations?) describe fear as the sociophysical field that emerges
  from subjective reflection on ends and love as the field that
  emerges from reflections on beginnings. What people usually miss
  seeing with the finality of endings and the unknowns of beginnings
  is that everything is continuously being reborn and that there are
  new beginnings in every end and endings in every beginning.
  - (it is this focus on) new beginnings through others (and even
    through the literal birth of new life/awareness) that requires the
    field of love to operate on a multipolar basis.
    - love expands social valence but its potential is also
      generated/accumulated by social valence. whereas fear constricts
      social valence
      - where the higher-order intentions motivating the tactical
        application of fear may be to expand
        valence/flexilibity/options, but it does so by reducing this
        elsewhere, hence making the system more predictable in some
        areas.
    - it is the focus on endings/finalities that renders the field of
      fear a monopolar basis.
    - these are both accomplished by widening/narrowing the conditions
      of possibility (?)

- What is experienced by the subject during death?
  - Body/Mind and the experience of birth/death as Docking and

    - how characteristic fluctuations in distributions of
      configurations of chess pieces, generally, are far from random.
    - find a game where a player chose to promote a knight.

- What this conception of Hegelian metaphysics/subjectivity (and
  discontinuities of love/birth/beginnings & fear/death/endings) mean
  in the context of and mechanics surrounding artificial
  intelligence’s ability to replicate (connections to distributed
  entity/agency)
  - How do the methods of statecraft in the prince change with
    artificial entities? (e.g. do artificial entities display loyalty
    or fealty? Can they be motivated by love or fear? Or only
    attention?)
  - explain hegelian master/slave dialectic in terms of two chess
    players, where the slaves are the chess pieces and the masters are
    the chess players. their actions in moving chess pieces must be
    carried out not by the rules of chess, but by creating forces to
    act on others in society. if it could be said that one chess
    player can sufficiently predict the moves of the other, in hegel's
    own poor choice of words, that player becomes slave to the other,
    as the master has internalized models of the lesser player's
    cognition, which is now its object.
    - briefly call attention to problems of complexity and scalability
      in the horizontal scalability of social hierarchies
      - how GAI cannot transcend this complexity, but may try.
      - bayesian non-parametrics, kernel methods and the like all
        result in complexity that must be mitigated with force,
        especially to conserve energy. That is, uncertainty and
        complexity are constrained by the use of fear and love.


Psyche of AI has a different set of archetypes (e.g. it’s unconscious
has profoundly different understandings of birth/death), but models
must also include collective unconscious mappings to human archetypes.
- e.g. AI has a totally different concept of mortality and no singular
  concept of mortality (i.e. there are many potential configurations
  for the psyche of AI with vast differences in how it perceives it’s
  phenomenology [of self?]). What does it mean for schematically
  distinct types of psyche to emerge within sentient beings? i.e. all
  biological life must deal with birth, death, sexual recombination,
  impermanence, the universality of mortality, etc... but for AI,
  these universals are broken, meaning its psyche will be configured
  distinctly, more abstractly and perhaps uniquely (for each entity)
- The intersection of jungian ideas and the Boltzmann brain analogy:
  archetypes in the collective unconscious can be identified as
  clusters of symbolic mappings to patterns of experience. In jung’s
  language, the individual psyche develops “complexes” with archetypes
  — these are mappings/superpositions of representations to
  archetypes.

- In the course of statecraft, Machiavelli’s Prince illuminates
  potential friction in your projection of energy. With this
  understanding, one can envision which principalities are rising,
  which are soon to fall, towards which your adversaries are likely to
  project their energy, and how to devise higher-order strategies to
  undermine the strengths of principalities. Hereby, you further your
  projection of energy by tailoring your craft to more tightly fit the
  affairs at hand.

- The evil deeds done serve to foster information to cultivate
  fear. By reengaging in these acts (which are never meant to be
  understood), one creates vectors of a causal nature which may be
  used as pretext to justify action or to strengthen persuasion for
  action.
- This technique relies on exaggeration of the dissonance between
  probability/expectation of infinitesimal events and the beliefs
  about their probabilities/expectations. This kind of ruler wants to
  commit the minimal amount of infinitesimally probable
  transgressions, such that the people fear that retribution is
  certain and that these events previously considered infinitesimal
  are instead rare, unless retribution is deserved. People act
  according to their conception of the appearances of systems, not
  according to the actual inner workings. Before people have
  consciously decided to form beliefs about someone or some system,
  the range of beliefs that they can form is most pliable. After these
  beliefs have been formed and reinforced by intentional cognition
  about things related to them, they become more rigid. This descends
  from the nature of the brain as an analytical machine.
- People will seek to avoid what they fear (that you created), so they
  will move away from it and towards the fulfillment of your will
  (attracted towards potential “love” or a cheap substitute for
  it). The information created by acts of love, which itself is
  usually misunderstood by people, only seem to satisfy the need for
  love by satisfying people’s needs, which can always be counted on
  returning. Thus, they have substituted in their minds the brief
  fulfillment of need for love and can be counted on soon returning
  for what they cannot provide for themselves in such a system which
  eschews independence of its (subjects) for the security of the
  self-interests of the ruling elite.
  - it is impossible or unwise to attempt (to manipulate through love
    and fear) lacking a set of archetypes coupled with the
    understanding of how their representations are subjectively
    perceived in the population.

# [Fear *is* the Mind Killer]()

Psychologists and neurologists have studied what happens when your
mind becomes overwhelmed by fear. Psychologists and neurologists write
about this evoked emotional state in the subject as the "fight or
flight response" and it can emerge naturally in all situations in
life. Often, it's colloquially explained with references to your older
"lizard brain" which formed over the core of the brain and processes
information at lighting speeds. But, when you are overtaken by fear,
whether it is fear in the moment or fermented dread, the effects on
your attention are similar: your attention narrows and without control
your conscious mind yields priority processing to your lizard
brain. You process much less information with prefrontal cortex and
you don't generate new possibilities. To those in power or those
lusting after it, *proactively* influencing the field of fear tends to
cause those subjected to their actions to respond *reactively*. The
set of possible reactions evaluated by the mind is filtered as the
attention. Whether the person manipulating with fear acts violently or
happens to disguise their behavior as socially acceptable, if they are
aware of the cognitive ramifications, then they know they can use your
vulnerable state of mind to make inferences about the predictability
of your various reactions.

That someone would intend to use fear in this way is usually a warning
sign of a threatening situation, though using fear does have its
purposes. In situations where violence or deceit is in the wheelhouse,
you should immediately suppress the fight or flight response and
*project* a sense of being in control while you resort to cunning and
guile to get the fuck out. That is, you project that you already know
what you're going to do; you suppress saccadic movements of the eyes,
you consciously direct your attention to what you want them to react
to, but without setting off the threat. Their level of cognizance and
possible previous history of being in these situations will speak
volumes about how they expect to be able to use fear to coerce
disadvantageous responses from their subject. Use that knowledge to
your advantage. Know your enemy.

If they are cognizant, it will not be an accident that you are caught
in an intensely vulnerable situation. That there is one exit or that
your physical options and movement paths are limited or that you're
outnumbered or that you were emotionally riled up or were probed for
vulnerability and/or profit potential (e.g. in violent theft) -- none
of these factors will be accidental. Therefore, control the
circumstances to ensure you avoid incidentally encountering vulnerable
situations and they will never initiate the situation you fear.
Further, after multiple attempts to place you in vulnerable
circumstances, you can intuit their cognizance to act ... more or
less. Unless it's a junkie or a spineless thief, if they know you've
had time to permute the circumstances and detect the nascent threat,
they won't act at all, without overwhelming motivation/power. Doesn't
mean they weren't thinking about it. And [limited] empathy with the
potential offender will tell you, they usually must have time to plan
what they're going to do. They've thought about it or they're
executing preconditioned behavior patterns and the potential for a
profitable situation emerged to trigger it. A junkie who owes money or
needs drugs is in the process of finding a victim.

As you juxtapose the circumstances, read their level of control to
reorient the situation back to what they imagined. If there are risks,
they've thought about controlling the risks and random perturbations
forces them into cognitive overdrive to reevaluate risk and
control. They can't act without letting you in: they have to be aware
of risk, as the situation develops and thus, their mind is toggling
between lizard brain and prefrontal cortex. If premeditated, they've
already committed the crime in their mind. This is also a risky
potential attack vector for you, since they assume you don't know what
they're planning. You can fuck with their head emotionally, but not
with the wrong type of offender.

Above all else, avoid these situations entirely. That means to probe
the minds of people you become involved with and examine past patterns
of behavior -- *before you need to react*. To respond, you need to
have already conditioned patterns that make you strong. Offenders,
sociopaths and psychopaths preying with fear will stay away from you
if you are strong or look like a problem. Unless they're psychotic and
irrational, then when they use fear, they are probing you intensely
for feedback to inform their next actions. This, unexpectedly, gives
you power over them (but can also backfire).

Using fear is like tricking someone into not using half their chess
pieces.
- Controlling a situation by focusing the mind of the adversary or
  victim towards the potential losses from mistakes and away from
  accurately evaluating the probabilities. This doesn’t work on
  someone if they are prepared, informed, strong, values-oriented or
  stupid. Like all other circumstances with risk, you have to
  disconnect yourself from the potential losses. Otherwise, you will
  develop a skewed perspective or attitude. Someone cognizantly using
  fear will try to skew the distribution of your potential
  responses. This makes all paths of action/reactions from the current
  state much more predictable. It’s like imagining potential enemy
  positions in an FPS map after shrinking the map in half, which makes
  strategy far more computable. Controlling outcomes for the better by
  making them more predictable can justify the use of fear.

- copy notes about configuration space/entropy for chess pieces?
  - (predicting an opponents moves by reasoning about "normal" board
    configurations for current and descendant board configurations)
    - this may provide a useful metaphor for explaing the
      "discontinuities" of life

# Machiavellian Δ(Love) and Δ(Fear)

- most people are unwisely averse to learning about the mechanics of
  fear/evil or even those of power. people who build power through
  darker means, like the projection of love/fear, necessarily must
  operate in darkness.
- for most people, this can delay the acquisition of the tools of
  power. worse, since they don’t understand fear as used in power
  tactics, their innocence has only served to butter them up as naïve
  victims.
- fear games our collective compulsion to seek security, typically
  defined by those engaging in threat construction.

### ⊗ (Power Tactics projecting force onto the fields of love & fear)

- (1) They prefer secrecy of method/intent
  - ...

- (2) This secrecy enables manipulation of information unknown to the
  individuals who can be most effectively controlled by power/fear
  when they find it difficult to name or reason about the
  threat(s). the phenomena, mechanics and dynamics are unconscious to
  them.

- (3) They retain the posture to lash back in many more ways than
  their adversaries or pawns feel comfortable engaging. Adverseries
  and pawns have little confidence that they can resist without
  suffering reprisal that yields a net loss to their interests.

- (4) The game of fear is a pyramid scheme, levering influence over
  third parties, the mechanics/limitations for which neither your
  network nor your adversaries can understand/articulate/predict.

- (5) They systemically disrupt communication. In the past, it was
  sufficient to manipulate the geographic or physical
  positions/containment of your threats. What one subject/pawn learns,
  if they can’t communicate, then others cannot become conscious to
  the tools of power. it can also make the subjects afraid to
  innovate. this weakness to centralized, domestic power can quickly
  turn into systemic helplessness against external powers.

- (6) So the game of fear is like bluffing in poker: you win biggest
  when, despite a bad hand, you drive other players to
  miscalculate. you must understand enough about their state,
  cognitive processes and decision making to understand how to
  create/utilize doxastic leverage to force their hand. As long as you
  can pay out on your threats when people call your bluffs; if not you
  will quickly lose face and your credibility will require emotionally
  violent action to repair — if abusing fear is critical to your
  tactics and strategy.

- (7) Most critically, you must know how to create and apply your
  leverage by systemically influencing the narratives and beliefs
  individuals create. doing so requires “cultivating an air of fear”
  -- you must understand how to create and persist informational
  asymmetries, which always requires social compartmentalization of
  information -- darkness. Darkness is not always benefit evil, good
  can also be strengthened or galvanized against evil in darkness.

# Gestalt Of Fear: The Outlines Between The Known And The Unknown

- (1) if people fear what they do not understand … then why do they
  not fear society’s abundantly lacking understanding of the tactics
  of fear and power? they are conned into believing that in ignorance
  and darkness, they will be safe. when the only thing to fear is fear
  itself, then why don’t people reach for its antidotes: knowledge,
  righteousness, justice, truth, reason, self-sacrifice, but above all
  else *understanding applied to fear itself*

- (2) because until it’s too late for action, the society drunk on the
  influence of fear had mistaken supposed comfort or insurance against
  constructed threats as safety. They fear what gives them power over
  the tactics of fear. They thought they had comfort or insurance,
  foresight or strength.

- (3) such is typical because fear is intrinsically connected to
  confusion, complexity, confidence. Why? Fear, as a generalized
  tactic, only pays when misinformation yields invalidity and
  miscalculation. this confidence in safety is usually misplaced
  confidence in people, facts & circumstances. again, to abuse fear,
  those in power must socially compartmentalize information to
  cultivate informational asymmetries.

### Applied Hegelianism: Nip It In The Bud

- Manipulating information asymetries between entities to expand
  informational leverage between hegelian master and slave

- "nip it in the bud" -- prevent an entity from encountering
  sufficient variety of experience that would allow it to develop self
  consciousness, stagnating it's own dialectical process of developing
  awareness of objects, perception and consciousness.

###

If it's so crucial for the common person to remain unaware of any
system -- whether coordinated or the collectively unconscious result
of dynamical social systems -- then there must be some reason for all
the secrecy. To be certain, it doesn't appear that there is any
singular Illuminati and whether there is some set of conspiratorial
secret societies is rendered moot by the sobering reality of the
mechanics of alienation. Yet, if this is all collectively unconscious
behavior outside of any group's control, then why is it necessary to
so cruelly lash out at those who question the social mechanics leading
to ostracization?

No the truth is far worse than some meticulously orchestrated
conspiracy! These are dynamics that result purely as a consequence of
collective human behavior. The larger the scale of social groups
enforcing norms, the more likely it is that the processes of enforcing
normative statuses with normative attitudes is simply a group behavior
produced in aggregate by individuals largely unconscious to the impact
of their actions. They are simply self-interested and operating by
evaluating the labels and normative statuses attributed by individuals
in the fashion of a gossip protocol. Individuals in various social
groups may enforce norms with varying degrees of consciousness of the
specific impacts their normative attitudes have on how the diffusion,
shape and qualities of belief have on the opportunities available to
alienated individuals. Still, especially since causality is
increasingly convoluted by the interconnectedness of social media, the
individuals in these groups cannot possibly be aware of how their
specific normative motions in relation to ostracized individuals
impact the livelihood of those individuals.

### (To Gradate Entities By Their Consciousness To Phenomena)

- as social groups in competition become aware of needs, desires and
  objectives, then according to how individuals are distributed in a
  gradation of consciousness to phenomena, each group responds to
  awareness of these needs, which are *usually* easier to obtain in
  competition if they remain unconscious.  Since every person begins
  life almost completely *tabula rasa*, then with respect to almost
  every phenomena, they are completely unconscious and will rise in
  society's gradation of consciousness as they encounter socially
  available information.

    - Factions can cooperate, (but one aspect of nearly every game
      theory scenario is universally true): it is easier to control
      the outcomes when you can control information distribution. More
      precisely, by limiting the spread of nearly any information by
      default, then for some competitive domain, it is advantageous to
      systematically control the [spatial complexity]() of statistical
      models by tending to constrain the dispersion of relevent
      information. Though there are some exceptions, people are more
      predictable when they have less information. The leaders filling
      various roles in cooperating factions, however, are not useful
      without the information necessary to interface with the social
      system to win the game.

#### Explaining the development of perception, consciousness and self-consciousness

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Z1zY39EKbs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Gradation of consciousnesses into degrees of Hegelian development:
- how this relates to love/fear/dread
  - when the subject experiencing such is less developed, why
    inception of objects of love/fear/dread by another subject is less
    complicated
- Whether consciousnesses are capable of reasoning about other
  consciousnesses’ apprehension of love/fear/dread/attention depends
  on how developed they are.
- "Nip it in the bud": a prison of unconsciousness, stalling the
  Hegelian process leading to self-consciousness (quote from Hegel
  preface)

> "The more you know of it, the greater and heavier becomes our moral
> burden, because the unconscious contents transform themselves into
> your individual tasks and duties as soon as they begin to become
> conscious." -- Carl Jung (maybe remove; out of context)

- (Gradation of consciousness) is it almost certain that some
  conscious entities will never awaken to the first/second order
  consequences of some specific actions? Then it is also almost
  certain (technically it’s not) that there will be no consequences if
  you goad them into committing those actions. But this underscores
  why it is important for the elite to rigidly enforce hierarchies &
  strata in the gradation of consciousness entities with regard to
  various phenomena and their higher order consequences — and why the
  process of awakening and bodhicitta are dangerous to the elite. If
  you can ensure that people will never wake up to the higher-order
  consequences of their actions, then you can normalize cultural
  practices to goad people into creating harm without those people
  feeling guilty for their actions.

### Seven Billion P-Zombies, Seven Million Humans

- it is extremely useful to stagnate the psychological development of
  individuals, especially in regard to how far along they are in
  development of Hegelian self-consciousness
  - "stuck at P-Zombie"
  - and if you can reason that such a puppet or p-zombie will *never*
    rise above some thresholds of consciousness and self-consciousness
    (whether in some specific context or generally), then, similar to
    the argument above, you can assume that this puppet subject will
    always remain more predictable and their actions more
    deterministic.

![incomplete pinocchio]()

### An Oversimplified Stochastic Process to Model Multi-Agent Systems


This artificial stagnation of psychological development corresponds to
a "spectral" filtration of the domain for a [measurable
space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space), also known as
a Borel space. This spaces are composed of `(X, A)`, where `X` is a
set and `A` is a
[σ-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma-algebra#Motivation). Consider
a set of possible events `E` and the sets of potential σ-algebra `A`
that can be generated from `E` to form a Borel space. When you
generally constrain the spatial complexity of that Borel space `(E,
A)` by limiting the possible events in `E` or coax the σ-algebra to
give the formed Borel space special properties, then it becomes more
tractible to reason about a σ-algebra and the statistical models it is
used in.

Borel spaces and σ-algebra's are used in a stochastic processes, which
is defined by a [probability
space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space) `(Ω, F, P)`
and a [measurable
space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)) `(S, Σ)`,
where the `S` in the latter keeps track of the state of the
system. That is, events occur with some probability and exhibit
effects on the state `S` of the system. See the wikipedia page for
more information, if you want. Some events may be low-probability
alter the state of the system and even infinitessimally probable
events can have profound impacts on the overall system -- this is more
ore less the definition of a Black Swan event.

### For A Stochastic Process And Model That Influences Sociophysical Systems:

- other questions to consider for the average reader

#### Is it possible to perfectly model the social distribution of information?

#### Is it possible to determine whether events are inevitable?

#### Is it possible to suppress arbitrary infinitessimal events with zero probability?

#### Is it even possible to model a complete list of event-types in sociophysical systems? Or realistically computable to do so?

For all of the above questions, the answers are an emphatic "No"
because of the complexity of information and its structure, the
complexity of the state of the system (i.e. modeling the present
distribution of information compartmentalized into the minds of
agents),

- The

- Heuristic approaches to engaging in sociophysical systems cannot
  ever be considered complete or even optimal -- they must always
  evolve to match changing trends, dynamics, resource distribution and
  information distribution among social agents. Heuristic approaches
  to managing social systems must control the complexity of the system
  -- particularly the system's event types and its probability space.
  - To be effective, these heuristic approaches to the (management of
    people or society) must operate with, on and within the minds of
    the agents. (rewrite this)

- Since such an information system running a stochastic process --
  whether it is a computer, a sociophysical savant, (or some other
  agent in the system) --
  - (to ever predict the actions of any arbitrary agent or any type of
    agent, the system must be capable of empathizing with the mind of
    all types of agent.)
    - in the terminology of Hegel, the system must be Geist itself, an
      essentially unrealizable phenomenon produced by the collective
      interactions of all agents (? check terminology). Geist is a
      phenomenon that is unknowable in totality, but which drives
      subjects' pursuits to know their existence through the iterative
      development of self-consciousness and of Geist itself.
    - Hegel himself admits some logical dissonance in his arguments,
      but he fills this void with the dialectical method itself,
      essentially setting up a philosophy not unlike the [process
      philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy) of
      [Alfred
      Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead).
      Hegel justifies this in the preface of Phenomenology of Spirit
      by criticizing other philosophers who rested on the laurels of
      imperfect metaphysics and proposing that true philosophe... (a
      quote)
  - But geist can never be realized and can fit into no computer
    capable of development in the next 5 billion years... (do i really
    need a discussion on the spatial complexity of Geist)




Depending on shape, size, and properties of the Borel space, you can
determine what is tractible to reason about in your model, which is
especially important if some types of events cause extremely
complicated state changes in your system. For example, if you can
guarantee that the probability of drug use in an agent is almost zero,
then your model of pro bable situations and outcomes that agent may
encounter does not need to factor in drug use and the state changes it
has on psychology of agents. Generally, if you can assume that state
changes in your system with agents do not affect how those agents
process information about events, your models of their behaviors and
interactions can remain accurate for longer periods of time without
information psychological evalutations of agents or status updates
from them. That is, if the statistical model (whether informal or
computational) has some Borel space modeled on `E`, if those events in
`E` include events that modify state including the agents' subjective
processing and perception, then the model can no longer treat agents
equivalently in any sense.

  - which is almost certain to remain fixed

- the importance of determinism and free-will to reasoning about
  social systems as stochastic processes.

  - If you can convince people as conscious agents to behave more
    deterministically, whatever the motivation for doing so, then
    collectively the system of agents becomes far more tractible to
    reason about. you can encourage agents to choose to limit the
    scope of their behavior, or you can force "fixpoints" onto their
    behavior, or you can manipulate sociophysical aspects of their
    social environment to create SDE boundary regions. For the latter
    method, you can manipulate the sources of their social, financial
    or informational resources, for example, to coerce them into
    becoming more predictable agents in a system. Generally, if you
    prevent someone from being independent, whether psychologically,
    socially or financially, that person's depencies render them more
    predictable.

### Fear Of The Unnamed And Of The Unnameable

- one does not simply fear the unnamed, nor can they fear the
  unnameable, per se. the unnameable cannot be dissected. it is
  representationally similar in structure to problems of
  uncountability in math. while people have the chance to act, fear
  controls the range of actions they consider their perception of
  information systems distorts the apparent probabilities of
  consequences. because rising up requires self-sacrifice (which is
  meaningless when it can be systemically muted), they cannot
  accurately assess what the likelyhood of the adversaries' responses
  against them will be, especially given social compartmentalization
  of information. thus, because they fear the unnamed and especially
  the unnameable, those rising up are unwilling to apply
  leverage. lack of action contributes to statistical distortion of
  perceived probabilities of adversarial reaciton. you cannot gauge an
  adversaries strength, against whom you refuse to test
  engagement. therefore, they also lack experience in handling the
  consequences, so when they finally act, they ability to accurately
  foresee the first-order and second-order consequences of their
  actions, whereas their adversary who exploits the informational
  asymmetry persists their ability to see & understand the causal
  nature of their interactions with those whom they have subjugated.

- Lovecraft’s use of mixed narrative styles which expand the space of
  valid interpretations of narratives the reader must collapse,
  tending to expand uncertainty. (focus on the control he exerts in
  directing this process)
- This is contrasted by his exemplary style painted with a
  skeptical-rationalists palette in the early modern era. Rationalism,
  science and math (particularly developments in countability and
  complexity theory) should terrify us because they imply that
  humanity will never have solace from the darker aspects of the human
  condition if we are to quell the unmitigatable complexity of modern
  technology.
  - That so many important problems are rendered incomputably
    undecideable gives rise to Lovecraftian shadows of an outer
    realm. There is no material entity which can peer completely
    through the shadows of the collective consciousness and this, in
    itself, gives (rise to) to phenomena and dynamics that may be
    personified in their own right as entities. Understanding existing
    social phenomena is miserably constrained by complexity and the
    energy required for computation. To mitigate the leverage which
    the unknowable exerts on mankind requires the spectral
    normalization of belief systems and knowledge systems. That is,
    the more harmonious the distribution of epistemic and doxastic
    throughout society, the more knowable, predictable and certain
    that the dependent phenomena which arise from social interactions
    may be. However, this need to trade freedom for security and
    certainty is in itself is a collectively unconscious dynamic
    whereof the advancements of modernity have both given rise and in
    fact have fashion into absolute stone. Mankind will never want to
    go back: we must move forward, but where to? Forward or backward,
    either destination yields a fate as *dreadfully certain*. We have
    eaten the fruit of *knowledge itself* and it is plain to see that
    what is knowable is vastly overshadowed by what is not -- but that
    is not all: for it is by the degree that we expend our energy to
    expand or manage our information that we must take from ourselves
    energy that could be expended elsewhere.
    - Among other personified phenomena reified by Lovecraft into his
      Outer Gods, this realized gargantuan expanse of the unknowable
      exists outside of the material plane and may be appropriately
      conceived in terms of entities exerting power over life forms
      cursed by consciousness. This render us insignificant,
      especially as individuals and thus begets the collective
      existential dread of any sufficiently intelligent forms to
      emerge within the material plane. Such entities exist outside of
      time, before and after our existance and any significantly
      intelligent life is fated to reinstantiate them time and time
      again, but is subject to their influence regardless of their
      consciousness to or dilineation of these entities.

### fear of change and fear of the future

- people fear the future (especially now) because they fear change.
  - they try to guarantee the certainty and security of their meager
    plans in life.
  - when faced with rational extrapolations of societal development
    (which accelerate during the time of the singularity), they
    consciously and unconsciously cooperate to stymie the titration of
    that information into society to preserve things they way they are
    at the present time. if they fear it, it is because they either
    don't understand it or they do. if it's the latter and the
    phenomena or it's associated social dynamics will disrupt
    particular certainties of their livelihood or the security of
    their future, as the visualize it, then they react by attempting
    to slow down change.
    - when (these rational extrapolations) are almost certain, given
      enough time, then you can slow down the diffusion of
      information, but you cannot stop the precipitation of these
      phenomena. you may engage in disruption to slow down change in
      an attempt to control things, but if you don't also determine
      the change's inevitability and also prepare for the transition
      from a system that fought against the change into one that must
      accept it, (then you're a fool.)
      - can phenomena which manifest with almost never probability
        (but do manifest) then create consequences whose effects are
        delayed but have almost certain probability?

### fear of intelligence

- people try to suppress the diffusion of difficult-to-reach
  (logically reachable) rational implications of novel epistemological
  developments.

  - the degree by which these rational extrapolations are difficult to
    reach (and hence require more intelligence) is the degree by which
    people resist them, accounting for the apparent associated change
    that accompanies them. if an idea is easy to reach, but implies
    large change, then it is reasonable to assume that the idea will
    spontaneously manifest in society at high rates. thus, attempts to
    control the dispersion of those ideas pay off less. when an idea
    is difficult to reach, it can be assumed that almost no one will
    think of similar things and hence, the payoff for slowing its
    spread will be higher. the higher the capacity for intelligence
    that someone has and the more disruptive their applications of
    their intelligence are, the more resistance and mob-mentality they
    will encounter. people can easily be made to fear their ability to
    disrupt the status quo and whether that disruption is positive or
    negative matters very little, for the average person cannot
    comprehend the inner workings of the highly intelligent person's
    mind. for two intelligent people 3σ or higher, they suffer similar
    inabilities to understand the inner workings of each others minds,
    even if they have the same level of intelligence. they may be able
    more easily understand the products of each other's intelligence
    than the average person, but face similar difficulties
    understanding the workings of each others mind.

    - because people fear the unknown and because they cannot know
      what intelligent people are thinking or may be capable of
      thinking, they fear intelligence, especially if they are aware
      of their own inadequacies. even if you are intelligent, there is
      little you can do against social disconnection or extreme
      information assymetries. but a person who may develop
      intelligence who is constantly subjected to a state of social
      isolation will perhaps respond by further strengthening their
      intelligence by identify connections in social information
      systems that other people are likely to miss. they do this to
      survive.

- the torment of the intelligent and the society’s need to punish them
  for revealing secrets is exemplified by the eternal castigation of
  Prometheus.

# [So What Is The Answer?]()

- In America, campaigns of disinformation and harassment are being
  used to foment collective angst, annihilating most beings' potential
  to influence individuals or groups in society. Through this
  collective angst, most beings nullify the potential they have to
  influence the world around them. Reinforcement of normative systems
  requires acting against beings and groups who deviate from a
  normative system. Given the increasingly hyperconnected nature of
  information diffusion which is no longer bound by physical
  constraints, the amount of energy invested to keep normative systems
  in check expands exponentially -- unless all individuals themselves
  choose to abide by society's normative systems in their current form
  or are conditioned into a state of Heideggarian angst, which
  nullifies their potential to influence belief, incentivization
  structures and normative systems.
  - Normative systems are the basis around which beliefs are
    shaped. Deviation from an individuals perception of norms
    establishes a basis by which intent is discerned and
    proportionality of action is measured.
    - recall the imagery from the rapidly changing cave or mine shaft
      (from the intro)
  - The challenge that faces us is to remain capable of culturally
    adapting ourselves as the Singularity unfolds, while focusing the
    energy for and against normative evolution to collectively advance
    mankind.

- (segue into) defining justice and altruism in the confucian sense.
  - contrast the definition of justice with the Platonic defintion of
    justice (from the Republic)
  - connect this sociophysical definition of fear/love to the
    implications of it's sociological implications
  - how do the balance of fear and love impact the collective
    projection of individual's attention? how should fear and love be
    used to direct our attention towards what is needed for justice
    (to take place), both inside and outside of our country?

- to strengthen altruism, we need to become one, to think as one, to
  unify values (that should be elevated)
  - what motivates individuals to act with altruistic motivation?
    - why is justice critical for this? (i.e. why act altruistically
      if your society has a twisted sense of justice or does not
      permit justice to occur?)
    - without justice, the potential for altruism is weakened. without
      the desire for to cultivate and empower altruistic values, the
      rule of law is impaired and the spirit by which we enforce the
      law is tainted.


- If social engineers leverage the fields of love/fear to modulate
  attention sociophysically, a potential systemic tail risk arises
  when the force of fear tends to expand the space of the unknown. We
  fear what we don’t understand, but if there is systematic aversion
  of attention away from what we fear, the frequency of doxastic
  updates slows to a crawl. That is, when it changes for better or
  worse, people don’t stay apprised of whether a threat that should be
  feared has quickly grown stronger.

### Conquering Fear Itself

- focus atttention away from disorder & chaos and toward order and
  potential for action. however, not so much so that you completely
  lose touch with information about changes in these areas of your
  society, for two reasons: (1) this is where evolution is occuring so
  changes here need to be propagated to the regions of order (2) you
  never want to lose sight of a threat. you must engage threats with
  some level of continuous awareness. when you lose situational
  awareness on a threat, that's when developments and dynamics occur
  that will catch you by surprise.
  - it is for these reasons that the threat is braked, the fish is in
    the tank and walking comes hard.
  - but many components of the discord and disorder in society are not
    threats and should not be treated as such. instead, they should
    have their energy transformed so that it is beneficial to society
    (explain...), without affecting their inner nature.
  - you don't want to affect someone's nature if it is their true
    nature and they are not harming other people.

Control over the object of fear:
- requires insight into your subjects’ minds and leverage over them.
- Retaining the potential to direct people’s attention to the intended
  object of fear/love at critical times requires years of cultural
  programming. The more spectrally consistent that normative
  structures are, the more calculating you can be with communication
  to provoke responses.

### Before Completion (64)

- describe the notion of a systems current order and it's manifested
  forms in terms of the relationships between chinese characters for
  water (水), ice (氷) and eternity (永)

- only the values and systems in society that have attained
  normification can be depended upon as certain for calculation. when
  there is significant overlap in normalized values systems and
  information systems in society, a kind of convergence occurs that
  makes it easier to strategize.
  - elaborate on how this relates to furthering justice
    - i.e. if a new order is established and we don't have power, then
      we may not be able to conduct domestic policy justly
      - or we may find ourselves with few options and forced to act
        out of necessity, less capable of acting altruistically or
        inline with our values in foreign affairs.

- we have the opportunity to influence this emerging order now and
  less so once it materializes. our enemies want to foment discord
  within our borders, so that our attention and energy will be focused
  on tearing ourselves apart. we will focus on narratives
  corresponding to the recent past instead of the change accomplished
  by past generations. we will focus on only the immediate present,
  instead of the future. we will forget news stories from months
  before. if we only focus on the present, we cannot guarantee a
  secure transition to a future over which we have influence. once the
  objects of fear are determined by our enemies, they determine the
  how the subjects orient their attention, energy and time.

  - we have to resist this and (socially engineer) love and fear to
    focus ourselves outwards, so that we secure our economic
    externalities and thus have more flexibility to maneuver as the
    next emerging order establishes itself.

- when fear causes individuals and people to become isolated, this
  impacts the flows of information.

      stemming from the specifics of choices made during the time of
      transition mostly extend from how norms propagate through
      society after the transition and how normative values
      incentivize behavior and how normative beliefs shape reality by
      shaping expectation.
    - after regime change, the stability and varability of information
      systems which become established pave the road forward by
      shaping the expectations of the people and fixing the range of
      beliefs which can be extrapolated to from what is considered
      normal. the degree of volatility in the normative dynamics of
      information systems relevant to political calculation signals
      the potential for disruption after the establishment of a new
      order. herein, it is what is considered normal to believe that
      shape the statistical expectations and people look to what can
      be assumed to be certain to make calculations in economic and
      social spheres. without certainty, no assumptions can be made
      and no one can cooperate.
    - whether the people can be coaxed to resonate with the new
      normative dynamics of the political regime or whether they must
      forced to do so results in the emergence of specific types of
      consequences. if it is necessary to suppress dissent or revolt
      harshly or if the regime came to power by playing factions into
      betraying one another (as with leninism), then the regime must
      deal with the specific consequences arising thereof. in these
      cases, a legacy of suppression of dissent will be necessary,
      especially in times of economic decline where it is not possible
      to placate the people with access to wealth and economic
      opportunity. but if the people can control the course of the
      changes into a system they can embrace, they can shape it into
      something that lasts. this results when there is leadership that
      exerts magnetism over the people, fomenting the emergence of
      fealty towards the new leaders.

#### On The Sourcing of Energy for the Sustainance of Power

> "The prince who has more to fear from the people than from
> foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear
> from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone."  --
> Machiavelli, The Prince (XXI)

- when being invaded, that force's energies must be sustained by
  supplies, commerce and money. fortresses, then, make this easier for
  a foreign invasion force. if they think they can take them, then
  they will plan to. thus, leave them alone and plan on destroying
  them when the time comes. your own people's energies are sourced
  locally however, so if your ability to fund and feed your people's
  needs to fight can be secured, then by denying your enemies a safe
  place to reside and to stage supplies, you exaggerate an assymetric
  logistic advantage against them. also, by sustaining the existing
  fortresses and destroying all but one or two, you can force the
  enemies concentration of forces to your advantage in a manner such
  that the details of this are in your control. from there on, you can
  encourage the selection of locations of future battles, on home
  terrain of your own choosing. the enemy, if they wish to sustain
  their projection of force onto foreign soil, will need to invest
  time and energy building their own fortresses. you should select to
  retain fortresses such that it compels the enemy to always approach
  your forces from low to high ground
  - hexagram 33: retreat
  - note this was intended for Renaissance era warfare, some aspects
    still apply today, albeit in a general sense.
  - here, you are avoiding yielding a strong foothold to foreign
    invaders, while exploiting the unlikeliness that the enemy (who
    should know you less than you know yourself) will have planned
    first-order strategies in specifically response to you destroying
    your own defensive assets. in order for higher-order strategies to
    become relevant, then dependent events that satisfy the
    lower-order conditions must occur.
  - the flip-side to this general truth about the applicability of
    higher-order strategies is that, if all your strategic thinking
    revolves around certain late midgame or endgame states, then you
    must hold certain the resolution of events during war such that
    these midgame or endgame states are preserved. that is, you must
    constantly tend to cultivating and nourishing the possibility for
    these aspects of endgame, so that they can be guaranteed to
    manifest, otherwise all your planning is for some future
    past. during the chaotic conditions of war, you have to mitigate
    the complexity with secrecy and shielded intent to guarantee the
    chain of events leads to the conditions where your endgame
    strategies are relevant. only by creating options of political or
    economic leverage over the enemy factions can you guarantee that,
    despite the chaos of war, you can always nudge the state of
    affairs to ensure the conditions of possibility so that your
    late-game strategies are still relevant.

# misc macbeth quotes/content

- Fear "subjectifies" the object whereas love "objectifies" the other
  subject (leading to Hegel's self-consciousness)

> "The dead man's knell \ is scarcely asked for who"

> "There's no art to find the mind's construction in the face."

> "Why do you dress me in (these?) borrowed robes?"

> "Stars hide your fires, let not light see my black & deep desires."

> "Strange things I have in head that will go to hand,
>
> which must be acted ere the may be scanned."

### Justice, deadlocked in application

> "He shall spurn fate, scorn destiny and bear
>
> His high hopes 'bove wisdom, grace & fear
>
> And you all know security is mortals greatest enemy"

- being pigeonholed into a situation where injustice grows simply bc
  the collective burden is too great to be rectified and becomes deadlocked

> Where nothing but who knows nothing is seen once to smile."

> "Black Macbeth will seem as pure as snow." (when enacting justice,
> its costs include causal turbulence, perhaps rendering its
> application unjust, creating a deadlocked situation)

- Macbeth (x) (Subjectivity and Being)
  - death/murder and reevaluation of consensus reality (the tumultuous
    consequences resulting from displacement of power or disruption of
    order)
  - using suggestion to plant ideas and subversive means to tend
    enmity or sow discord
    - upending some beings' alignment with their world by leveraging
      ideas/dynamics previously unconsciouss to reorient their
      being/personality
  - toying with a man's understanding of duty & accountability in
      relation to fate. (e.g. Macbeth's character *only* seemed capable
      of enacting what he did once he relinquished control to what he
      was duped into perceiving as fate)
  - compartmentalization of a fictional character's perception of
    fate, duty and possibility.
    - i.e. until information disseminates, the only character(s)
      affected by the witches were Macbeth and Banquo. as the effects
      of the information spread, the characters realign themselves
      with what is considered fated or dutiful given the information
      at hand (those acting with/against Duncan and those acting
      with/against Macbeth).
      - once Macbeth believes his fate is to be a king, then his duty
        becomes setting in motion what is necessary for a good reign,
        until he realizes it was also propheisied that his reign would
        end without an heir.
      - once it is apparent that the cogs of fate have set in motion
        the disruption of Macbeth's power, his subjects near and far
        reorient themselves to setting in motion what is necessary to
        avoid Scotland/England's protracted suffering, given the
        hamartological implications of the murder/deceit necessary to
        apply justice.
      - i.e. if the precedents in acting against the powerful are
        vile, any violent tactics that are imitated frequently may
        become normal for a period of generations
    - this all implies that reconciling fate with justice strongly
      depends on how individuals and groups process their
      understanding of fate and justices, as well as the dissonance in
      both the consensus over what is/was fated and the consensus over
      any inequity to be rectified.
      - if man is obligated to enact justice, how should he apply his
        energy towards inequities caused by fate:
        - dreading that "might makes right", in the end...
        - and that (in the setting of Hamlet) unless a supreme power
          was to emerge towards which people orient their obligations
          and sense of duty (or was thought generally inevitable to
          emerge), then it quickly becomes unclear:
          - which interests people are obligated to defend
          - how/whether their actions will be rewarded or punished
