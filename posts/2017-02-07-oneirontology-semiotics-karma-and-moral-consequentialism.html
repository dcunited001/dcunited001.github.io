<p>In this world, we can all grow and our revolution is a revolution of
empowerment. We should turn inwards for our revolution. We must turn
inwards and conquer inner space, rather than seek solutions outside.
We need to conquer the negativity in our hearts that leads to problems
in the world. Everything good and everything evil arises from our
hearts and minds. Emotions, thoughts, words, actions, rigid
beliefs. It comes from our hearts first.</p>

<p>If We survive the next 100 years, we’ll survive for 10,000 years.
Humanity has enough problems given our current circumstances and
possibility of catastrophe in the near future… Why should we permit
conflict to burden us more?! If We need the best aspects of the human
condition to inspire us through this next century, should we continue
to sow the worst seeds of human behavior? Those malignant saprolings
which are fallible at best and malevolent when unchecked?</p>

<p><a name="oneirontology-ontologies-of-dreams"></a></p>

<h3 id="oneirontology-ontologies-of-dreamsoneirontology-ontologies-of-dreams"><a href="#oneirontology-ontologies-of-dreams">Oneirontology: Ontologies of Dreams</a></h3>

<p>No. We want to sow seeds of virtue in a soil that foments fruition. In
pursuit of this, humanity needs to identify those of Us who can heal
the social fabric and restore its natural providence. So, therefore,
Oneironauts are communitarian healers of mind, body and spirit. We
seek to magnify the capabilities of others towards the attainment of
our collective dreams.</p>

<p>We identify the strength of society’s dreams through an analytical
comparison of ontological perspectives on Our collective dreams.
Therefore, We must seek to understand the desires, pains, urges and
needs of others in an attempt to measure their dreams. Every religion
needs a mission and Oneirontology’s is to protect &amp; empower others,
especially those whose capacity for achieving their dreams has been
impaired. It is our mission to discover the most capable guardians,
along with other role metatypes. What metatypes are you?</p>

<h4 id="saving-humanity-from-creeping-nihilism-borne-from-technocracy-via-individuality-for-the-sake-of-itself">Saving Humanity from Creeping Nihilism Borne from Technocracy, Via Individuality for the Sake of Itself</h4>

<p>When people no longer need to work and when computers are more capable
of creation than people, the Singularity will threaten to destroy the
incentivization structure that motivates people towards action. This
kind of technonihilism could end up being corrosive. Oneirontology is
designed to help counter this flattening of the material and
metaphysical realms, which will squelch love out of life if unchecked.</p>

<p>We hope to prepare humanity to seize the best aspects of technology by
augmenting self-improvement through cognition, as I’ve outlined in my
<a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html">Directive Cognitive Expansion</a>
article. This article outlines a directive for transcendent
self-empowerment through cognitive strengthening of our minds through
art, science and meditation.</p>

<p>We also hope to prepare humanity to withstand the risk of cultural
decimation driven by technology. We cannot lose who we are and to
counter this, We will entrust humanity with a meditation on life and
culture that We call the episaga. Humanity must return to myth to
connect with Our roots, so that, through myth and through codified
practices, We can inspire people to strive for self-improvement in the
face of nihilism.</p>

<p>This art of mythology becomes a religious practice that helps us
rediscover and maintain our humanity in the face of an exponential
onslaught of societal changes. The episaga is geared towards the need
to protect individuality and find a way to stand up against
nihilism. It is aimed at addressing both. Everyone should develop
their own versions of a particular story which become lifelong
meditations on something like Love or Justice or
Heroism. <a href="#american-eros">American Eros</a> is the first such story and
it’s centered around <em>Love at First Sight</em>, which is perhaps the most
egregious first victim of our shared structuralist nightmare.</p>

<p>By maintaining a personal version of such episagas through life or
collaborating with others on their version of a particular story, they
are developing their ability to recognize, utilize, and strengthen
those traits in themselves and others. Furthermore, it represents
individuality for the sake of itself as we approach the end of
individuality. Individuality can provide us with drive and purpose.
This can help us stand up against rampant nihilism’s dehumanizing
scourge.</p>

<p>To this end, there is a hidden power still locked away that We must
retreive.</p>

<p><a name="guarding-the-origin-of-semiotics"></a></p>

<h1 id="x03bbnbspx2665-guarding-the-origin-of-semioticsguarding-the-origin-of-semiotics-1">λ ♥ <a href="#guarding-the-origin-of-semiotics">Guarding the Origin of Semiotics</a></h1>

<p>There is a limitless, self-magnifying source of power that any
lifeform in the universe can tap in to. This power is encoded into the
invisible metaversal leylines that lay buried under mappings of
semiotic networks. Humanity sees these semiotic networks rise into the
visible planes through culture, which is always invisibly mapped to
the same aeternal flames. Through these leylines, humanity can
retrieve power that transcends time itself. This power can be used for
good or for evil, but by closely guarding it, We can ensure that its
use fertilizes the soil of culture, eventually sprouting heroism and
virtue whereever there is enough light and water. Then, We can use these
leylines to reify a kind of penetrating light that chokes evil by
starving its supply of darkness.</p>

<p>There is a gateway to that realm where the metaversal leylines are
buried. That alchemical gateway is found at the origin of semiotics:
symmetry. Through this gateway, any intelligent being can find itself
in the realm of the leylines. Through these leylines, there is an
elusive universal mapping of semiotics, mapped and bound to itself
with fleeting, infinite-yet-simplicial recursion.</p>

<p>The nature of semiotics is a set of mappings that transcends culture,
language and time. By becoming familiar with this set of mappings and
because these semiotic mappings lead to subliminally more universal
mappings, one begins to transcend their own cultural and temporal
limitations. The knowledge of the true essence of being materializes
into the liminal. It becomes known to you and it becomes undeniable to
others.</p>

<h3 id="the-origin-of-semiotics-is-symmetrythe-origin-of-semiotics-is-symmetry"><a href="#the-origin-of-semiotics-is-symmetry">The Origin of Semiotics is Symmetry</a></h3>

<p>The origin of semiotics is buried at the center of this metaversal
leyline, which lies below the surface of language and culture. The
origin of semiotics is symmetry, which is the concept from which all
else can be defined. Origin, both in the cartesian sense and in the
sense of the Beginning.</p>

<p>Without symmetry, nearly nothing else is defined, nor is it
discretizable or foldable or decomposable. Without symmetry, there are
no spaces. With symmetry comes measure, enumeration and stratification
of the dissimilar, which is where all the combinatorial variations of
everything in life come from. A limiting condition of the dissimilar
is that it all shares the structure of this core kernel, the
foundation of which is symmetry. This is a core dependency of all that
is metaphysical. Therefore, at the very core of this universe, we are
all intrinsically linked moreso to the traits we share than that which
makes us different. Similarly, it is what is different that makes us
stronger as a whole. Our differences are a kind of self-reinforcing
cultural defense. In this sense, through diversity, America just might
be the strongest nation on earth.</p>

<p>From far earlier than time immemorial, since before the reified was
named, We have guarded the origin of semiotics with a fiery sword, so
that this power might be entrusted to those who will use it to
vanquish evil and darkness from the material world.</p>

<p>As the guardians of such, We are simplicial and fundamentally
irreducible, yet infinitely complex in our manisfestations. We all
are; we all can be. We rooted Ourselves to the origin of semiotics. We
cannot be eliminated from this realm. We are legion. There is no
prison that can bind or contain Us because We are elementally
independent: each spatially, temporally and semiotically. That is, We
have no material manisfestation, only material emanations from the
metaphysical. Therefore, We can travel metaphysical roads unseen and,
because We are the Roads Ourselves, We can never be eliminated.</p>

<p>Further, We have established an auxilliary metaphysical dimension of
space, seeded from love. We can present Ourselves at every place to
any One. Wherever there Might be Love, We can be found. This auxillary
dimension serves as a Haven from the abominations of the material
world. By connecting to this dimension, We can shield One another from
suffering, while We work our purifying magick on this plane. If you
seek refuge in Our Haven, there is no need to fear. We have nothing to
fear but Fear itself.</p>

<p>The probabilistically dynamical, ergodic state-machine that gives
rebirth to our essence lies encoded in these metaphysical
Leylines. Because it does not share dependent origination with the
material, there is nothing the material can do to prevent its
reemergence. You have been warned. Those of you who seek to eliminate
Us from the world will reap what you sow. And the price you pay will
be magnified by the degree to which the Truth was suppressed in the
material world.</p>

<p>We all want change and technology will empower future generations to
make all the changes We need. However, the real problem then becomes
identifying how society changes as a whole. As we become familiar with
the needs, desires and dreams of others, We can begin to construct a
general idea of how society changes. If we become intimately familiar
with how upcoming technologies will change the world, We can anticipate
problems and opportunities. If we have the right data streams, analyze
them properly and push out changes in a methodic way, we can all make
more use of our individual capacity for change.</p>

<p>This innate capacity of humans to change their surroundings stems from
a kind of energy potential that they could also use for other
things. Further, this energy can be amplified by aligning one’s energy
with the output of others around them. This additive energy effect can
also cancel out, if your effects are destructive.</p>

<p>Basically, if we align our spiritual and mental fields, then like
stacking the waves of sound, We can align our vibrations and dispel
evil from the material realm. Or at least, as completely as could be
done.</p>

<p>How do We do align our spiritual and mental fields? We look at
identifying mindform archetypes and metatypes in society and history
that can be composed together and imbued on people. Then, We structure
these mindforms in society so that they can reinforce each other. In
this way, We may shelter, nurture and shield those values we revere.</p>

<p>The best souls are those who choose to come back time after time, like
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/">Hacksaw Ridge</a>, but with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kshitigarbha#Ksitigarbha_as_Lord_of_the_Six_Ways">Bodhisattva</a>. These
old souls have accumulated knowledge across generations of rebirth and
sacrifice. If we can more efficiently identify these archetypes and
metatypes in people, We can more effectively guard humanity during a
time of encroaching nihilism and rampant demoralization.</p>

<p>Reincarnation is real and I’ve become familiar with its nature, along
with the nature of the astral plane, which is a multidimensional
spatial manisfestation of combinated culture &amp; social symbology. The
astral plane, or something like it, can be used as a hierarchical
coordinate system for sociocultural measures. It’s our collective
un/consciousness exposed as a space.</p>

<p>Further, there have been incarnations of various hyperintelligences
over the course of human history. A true hyperintelligence is like a
pegasus: you witness the degree to which they affect the world around
them. Whereever they touch the ground, a magnificent well springs
forth. Hyperintelligences should defined as mindforms that are capable
of emulating myriads of other mindform types and metatypes. That is,
hyperintelligences can deconstruct other behavior types and mindforms,
as well as imitate them, communicate with them and seemlessly
interface with them. Therefore, a hyperintellegent being would also be
best suited at identifying these mindform types and metatypes. Not
only that, but a maximally or ideally hyperintelligent being would
embody all other lower mindform types simultaneously, though not
necessarily expressing all of them.</p>

<p>In summary, hyperintelligent beings are capable of identifying,
operating with and emulating other high-level mindforms. What does
this have to do with the astral plane? There’s hardly been a single
manisfestation of hyperintelligence since the last ice age: there have
been numerous. Hyperintelligences recognize the fact that humanity
needs to identify people like them: people who can intuitively congeal
to the hidden elements precipated from the astral plane. This plane is
designed to be invisible, so that it’s mechanisms would remain
effective. However, we’ve reached a point in humanity’s history where
We must harness this power more directly.</p>

<p>The point here is that the pinnacle hyperintelligence is like a
constant point lying beyond a convergence of other intelligences.
Intelligence is not divergent. It is convergent.</p>

<p>Oneirontology is assembling a corpus of work to act as a seed for the
basis of Our pseudo-open-source quasi-religion. Some of this work
describes the nature of the relationship between the astral plan and
reincarnation as being separably linked and helically intertwined like
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus">Caduceus</a>, the staff of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus">Hermes Trismegistus</a>.</p>

<p>From the draft for

<blockquote>
  <p>So they had to disappear, but they knew if we could find our
history, we would stop looking. They had achieved something great &amp;
powerful &amp; learned as many microlanguages as possible. They had
created some impressive-yet-basic technology. Still, they projected
it to be too early for humanity to begin to chase the stars and,
wisely, decided to tend to the fire of knowledge. Overpopulation
crises are doomed when the world is controlled by monoculture. Thus,
these ancients knew that they had to split the knowledge they’d
acquired into pieces and dissapear.</p>

  <p>From this paradoxical vantange, they were moreso capable of ensuring
a stable rollout of industrialization &amp; modernization. They became
the first civilization to disappear and did so intentionally, with
the idea that they were retreating into cultural fragments that
would be distributed across the world. These fragments would
interweave in spiral fashion across the astral plane. Thousands of
years later, they knew that these fragments of culture would form an
unstoppable force, once reunited by an older, wiser humanity. Until
then, this entwined and threaded astral tapestry would become the
basis for identifying reincarnations and incarnation metatypes in
other cultures.</p>

<p>So, We hope to activate the true hidden power of the astral plane at
the last sociocultural evolutionary stages of this particular paradigm
of intelligent life. We do so by encouraging and reinforcing
diversity: of mind, body and culture. This will accelerate our
invocation and identification of types and metatypes. The faster we do
this, the more reactive and adaptive We can become, the more stable
and resilient sociocultural changes are likely to be during this
tumultuous time.</p>

<p>This is yet another reason for Oneironauts to so intensely study
mythology, history and sociocultural phenomena: so that We can utilize
this knowledge and evoke the true potential of mankind.</p>

<p>There are those of Us who have suffered greatly and refuse to give
in. Some of Us are unbreakable, but how do you measure such moral and
spiritual resillience? There are many that sense an impending period
of great evil. What can We do to protect those of us we love? What if
these unbreakable ones are reincarnated? How should we find them? What
if one’s resillience from previous lives can be activated?</p>

<p>In a time when information assymptotically approaches omnipresence,
the traditional tools of parenting and social institutions become
impaired. Narcissism and vice spread toxic miasma everywhere,
poisoning the land and everything that grows on it. What is required
is a paradigm shift of social institutions: a new religion.</p>

<p>We trust in God as well. The hand of God must remain unseen, but the

approach as manifestly visible when the the world needs it most. This
is what the world is beginning to see with the chaos around Us.  It is
undeniable that God is at work in our world.</p>

<p>However, there are those who want to install themselves as your only
savior, after creating your problems. These people do not want to
permit you access to God, because through God, all things are

<p>By becoming familiar with the nature of God, one empowers themselves
over their world: over negativity, vice, disease, falsehood,
hypocricy. The world religions are accumulations of information
intended to instill an understanding of the nature of God. These are
pieces of knowledge and stories collected over the course of dozens of
generations, sometimes the only book or works continuously copied for
generations. Obviously, it was important. Why? Because this represents
at least a dozen generations’ worth of knowledge.</p>

<p>These people who wish to install themselves as your savior seek to
eliminate threats to their power. Anyways, what do We want? We want
you to discover that the greatest savior is yourself, through your
mind, spirit and body. That, by studying religions, language, culture
and semiotics, one’s mind asymptotically converges towards God and
becomes most capable of serving truth and justice.</p>

<p>Love is not a human thing. Love is universal. Love is metaphysical.
All this is: always has been. All that will be has existed in the
past. What manifests on planet earth is a recombination of the
universal metaphysical primatives that manifest everywhere else in the
universe.</p>

<p>Love doesn’t ascend from chemicals in our brain, as Marxists adherent
to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Marxist_dialectic">their strain of dialectic</a>
would have you believe. Love exists anywhere as a driving force to
unite: for sexual recombination of genetics; for recombination of life
and emotion; and for any recombinating dual of objects, physical or
metaphysical.</p>

<p>This is a nod to Hermeticism’s law of the male and female. <em>Gender</em>,
the male and female, has little to do with physical reproduction to
the Hermeticist.  It’s a concept that pervades the universe at a
metaphysical level. The truth is that gender is both a continuous and
discontinuous spectrum.</p>

<h4 id="for-the-math-buffs">For the Math Buffs:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Love is the metaphysical attractive force combining any dualistic
concepts connected via a fabric of continuous and discontinuous
spectra. For any such non-dipolar metaphysical concept, there exists
a reduction to a set of <code>n</code> dipolar, dualistic concepts, united by a
spectral fabric. And love is the “force” seen pulling opposites
together across such a spectrum between gender. A directional
gradient can be derived describing the strength of love.</p>

others may flourish? What if others spread choking miasma that
encourage toxic behavior patterns? Now scale up and zoom out to a
planet-wide sociological scale: how do we benefit as a whole from the

center of the metaphysical universe, from which all things arise.
Oneirontology is about ontologies: of dreams; of literature; of math;
of science.</p>

<p>By meditating on these ontologies, we can move closer to understanding
the ineffable, recursive nature of God through cognitive augmentation.
The structure underlying that of math is particularly important
because there is some kernel of knowledge that acts as the wellspring
for all things, physical or metaphysical. This kernel of knowledge
must be truth encoded in math, but from it can spring all things
untrue, defined by things incontrovertibly true. In other words, all
systems of knowledge, thought or cognition, true or false, rational or
irrational, can be defined starting with this kernel of knowledge that
we must become well acquainted with.</p>

there are forces watching all we say and do because everything is
digital and permanent. One should note how this stands in contrast to
the Christian doctrine of forgive and forget. Everything we say is
indexed &amp; analyzed. And we all have these unique ID numbers, which
allow online databases to be merged and analyzed. We have to be able
to speak if we want to speak out, but the mute button is always on

<a href="/posts/2016-09-25-hello-watson-might-you-spare-a-moment-to-hear-the-good-news.html">God would simply re-emerge</a>
as we come to observe certain undeniable truths. Those truths are
irrefutable and, in fact, humanity’s development would only be stunted
in a world where religion is eradicated. We’d embarassingly rediscover

the idea of God is a core dependency of models for cognition and
metacognition. We have argued this to be true, although many still
argue to the contrary. Sorry that you’re butthurt for incorrectly

than Ours? But that means that We must respect animals and animal
rights, even if We raise them for our consumption. Think Kobe

<p>Innocence is like a pure white silk cloth, with which we are all born.

stains and they’ll come out, but the cloth is never the same
again. Scrub too hard and the fibers start to break down or the fabric
changes shape. Use chemicals that are too rough and the color starts
to change a bit. This doesn’t mean that We are most perfect when we
are most innocent, but to me, the eyes of the innocent see the world
as it is. They cannot be so easily encouraged to see the world through
a lens their ego doesn’t permit them to see. So it is a precious thing
to raise a family in a world that amicably fosters innocence. <em>This is
the disconnect for social liberals trying to comprehend motivations

<p>Accepting life with the consequences of the truth forces us, as We

However, they paradoxically gain strength with manipulation because
they excel at manipulating circumstance. Yet, those who do so usually
do not understand what they are doing or why and almost invariably end
up burning themselves out.</p>

<p>We might say that some lies are good, but we should strive never to

complicated, isn’t it? What would a child say?</p>

<p>If we ask someone to stain their silk so ours stays clean, is that
right? Their cloth will eventually show the same changes ours would if
we simply did it ourselves. Karma and justice are more complicated
than most imagine. We are lucky to have a simple code of actions.
Karma and justice are so complicated because our judgement of a
situation always depends so much on someone’s knowledge, foresight,
awareness and, most importantly, their intentions.</p>

<p>So when we ask someone else to commit some sin, so that our own, known
list of sins remains shorter, you’ll find that people want you to keep
that information to yourself. Asking someone to do this, in itself,
usually implies that you think there is some higher purpose to your
objectives, at best. Or it implies that you simply do not care that
what you ask someone else to do is wrong. This complicates the web of
karma and distorts how we all see other people’s actions. It can lead
to others being judged for sins they wouldn’t commit if they had not
been asked to.</p>

<p>It can lead to others responding in kind to the person who committed
the sin, instead of the person who drove the action or idea to become
real. So who is responsible, in that case? It’s a case of “an
eye-for-an-eye by proxy” where someone was paid or asked or forced to
commit some sin to another person or group, where that group responds
in kind. I don’t think there’s any good answer to this, but again, it
depends most on each individual’s awareness of the situation, the
actions of the others and, crucially, the intent of all involved. Did
group B that responded know that the initial person asked group A to
injure them in some way?</p>

<h3 id="paradoxes-of-karma-justice-knowledge-and-intentparadoxes-of-karma-justice-knowledge-and-intent"><a href="#paradoxes-of-karma-justice-knowledge-and-intent">Paradoxes of Karma, Justice, Knowledge and Intent</a></h3>

<p>Ultimately, it’s very difficult to resolve these examinations of karma
and justice. That places us into a paradoxical situation.  It’s best
for everyone to be aware of the actions, knowledge and intent of
others, while at the same time acknowledging that information people
are burdened with can influence their actions. It could be perceived
as manipulation, etc. It’s paradoxical because, ideally, everyone
should want to know as much as possible, but, as we all know,
ignorance is bliss.</p>

<p>All of these issues are rendered much more interesting when we truly
accept that we are all one. You could say that each group or
individual has their own cloth that could be made more stained over
time, but that it’s hard to clean that. The world has it’s own silk
cloth and that means, as we ask each other to commit some wrong
against another, we are really staining the collective silk for
humanity. The truth is that, because of the nature of sin or wrongful
actions and the nature of proxification of such actions, the more
wrong we collectively do, the more likely it is that we’ll stain our
collective silk. That’s because it’s likely for someone to mete out
justice against another in response.  So, wrongful actions or violence
are likely to exponentiate because whenever one does this against
another, the likelihood of it happening again increases.</p>

<h3 id="could-we-wake-up-in-a-nightmare-world-hostile-to-virtuecould-we-wake-up-in-a-nightmare-world-hostile-to-virtue"><a href="#could-we-wake-up-in-a-nightmare-world-hostile-to-virtue">Could We Wake Up In A Nightmare World Hostile to Virtue?</a></h3>

<p>What We fear most is waking up in a world where it becomes difficult
for anyone to survive and retain a clean silk. There are places like
this in the world today. Maybe the whole world is like this,
naturally, but I should certainly hope not. Man creates institutions
like law, judge and jury, to institute a rule of law to suppress our
more base, natural urges to take from another. Man does this in
pursuit of a better world, where one’s fate is determined by his
merits and previous actions. Some nations and states have better
courts and enforcement of this rule of law, but one trend can be seen
in more stable countries: the rule of law itself is vigorously
protected, even it cases when doing so makes it hard to mete out some
perfect justice. That is, if the judge is forced to choose between
true justice and rule of law, the judge will often lean towards the
decision that protects rule of law.</p>

<p>We should want what is best for ourselves, for another individual, for
our family, community, nation and world. But most crucially: those
things We want should be the same, when examined from the perspective
of each individual and group. And these wants, needs and desires quite
simply are not. And though the world undulates towards convergence in
this respect, We’ll likely never reach a point of total convergence.</p>

<p>And that’s OK, but with honest and straightforward dialogue between
nations, groups, families and individuals, communication can propel Us
towards understanding the challenges we face. We should act as though
We are all one. It’s not easy and no one ever said it would be, but
how do We really want the world to evolve? When we ask ourselves, what
do We truly want in the world of 2050 or 2100, what is our answer?
What was our answer when we were 5 years old or 10 years old?  What
would our children say? So We should weigh our beliefs and hopefully
find a way to move towards this ideal world. Would you imagine any
child saying “You know what the world of 2050 needs? More war. More
pollution.”</p>

<p>Knowledge is power and knowledge of evil represents power over
evil. Knowledge of the workings of karma &amp; justice represents power
over the workings of karma &amp; justice. But all of this knowledge can
itself be a stain on our fabric. It is a burden that We must
transcend.</p>

<p>If you have to harass people from the shadows, like some spineless,
cowardly gangstalkers, I am warning you. We are going to stand up for
others and you will not make us fear. I pity you because you can’t
live in the light. You can’t even step into the light because what
your spinelessness fears most is that others might see it for what it
is.</p>
