<p>I love taking the time to stop and think about literature I read and
movies I’ve seen and virtual worlds that I’ve explored. I love
thinking about how profoundly different works have affected me. And it
seems that there’s always something else to pick up when I take the
time to reexplore them.</p>

<p>Why was it that these works affected me so much at that point in my
life and how would they have affected me later on?  When I first read
that chapter or saw that scene, what was I thinking? What should I
have noticed and why didn’t I notice it? What compelled me to finish
that RPG, but not others? Was the story not as compelling or was the
pace not consistent enough? Why was I so drawn to that character and
how did my own thoughts about him/her change as the character
developed? What was it that drew me in at first and why? If I was to
create my own work, how could I recreate that magical moment?</p>

<p>Over time, your answers to questions like these will change as you
learn more about life.  So if you do not capture your reactions
authentically and as they happen, you’re likely to lose touch with
that part of yourself that you embodied at that time. This and other
sweet zens are sure to follow.</p>

<p><a name="what-is-your-message"></a></p>

<h1 id="what-is-your-messagewhat-is-your-message-1"><a href="#what-is-your-message">What Is Your Message?</a></h1>

<p>Do you ever feel like you’re carrying a message that no one else has
heard? Do you feel the weight of that on your shoulders? Do you feel
that if you didn’t write something down, that it might be months or
years before you have the same thought? That it might be some time
before anyone else is viewing a subject through that particular
perspective? Perhaps, months, years or maybe never? … Though,
obviously, not every thing I think of is revolutionary.</p>

<p><a name="what-is-your-story-and-why"></a></p>

<h3 id="what-is-your-story--whywhat-is-your-story-and-why"><a href="#what-is-your-story-and-why">What Is Your Story &amp; Why?</a></h3>

<p>Do you feel that your experiences would allow you to craft a message
that’s meaningful to people from all walks of life?  How well do you
really know people?  Are there really “types” of people or is each
person their own brilliant, perfect self?  What makes them laugh, cry
or come to understand something they couldn’t before?  Better yet,
what if your story allowed someone to understand things for the first
time, that they had otherwise been missing out on? Some crucial aspect
of life? Or something that perhaps everyone has missed in life.</p>

<p>How do you take a core idea and extrapolate it into a novel or script?
I’ve found that this would be very challenging and the resulting
material would seem stilted around one topic – it’d feel like a
painting that just encapsulated one idea. Much more artistic is the
painting that provides enough to stimulate exploration of a set of
ideas. It’s not so straightforward that the art is … well, I’d
rather not elaborate on every detail of these things.</p>

<p>The point is, you’ll be much more successful if you merge a few
incomplete ideas. For some genres, content of mixed origination glued
together roughly is perfect, as it adds a characteristic style to a
work or a series of collaborations. The imperfections are what will
lead to opportunities for improvement and thus creativity.</p>

<p>I hope to describe how to use elements and methods of this creative
process to facilitate the development of higher-quality, more
meaningful writing in myself, as well as my readers.</p>

<p><a name="machinations-beneath-the-surface"></a></p>

<h3 id="machinations-beneath-the-surfacemachinations-beneath-the-surface"><a href="#machinations-beneath-the-surface">Machinations Beneath The Surface</a></h3>

<p>Most people view things through a common lens because they haven’t
dove in to explore their true nature. People who understand the inner
workings or true nature of some tech, some medium, some idea, they see
beyond the surface and into its mechanics. For them, this subject is
marvelously more sophisticated, yet wondrously simple.  It cannot be
rigidly defined and neither can its potential. To them, it is
difficult to state something is or is not possible because they see
multifarious solutions.</p>

<p>It’s like peering over a bridge into a river, where some sections are
deep and others are shallow, with rolling rapids and rocks
exposed. But the deeper sections of the river, you can observe the
rocks beneath the waves. Even though you can’t see the rocks or the
riverbed directly, you can still infer their presence because of what
you see on the surface. This is how I see reality; the divide between
the physical world and the metaphysical. Some of the metaphysical must
certainly be there, even though I can’t directly observe it.  In fact,
I may never see it, but I know that it’s there.</p>

<p>I get distracted because my mind is too populated with connections to
random things.  If my mind were a graph and whatever I was looking at
or thinking of were our current node, then on average, I would have
dozens as many edges to other nodes as the average normal person.
Several factors contribute to this: I know tons of useless trivia, I
tend to examine various trivial aspects of things and I try to
correlate more than the average person.</p>

<p>And so I tend to pursue a lot of tangents and it’s a bit harder to
control where my mind goes, but that’s actually a strength.  If I
rigidly focused my mind and ignored all the fleeting thoughts, there
would be many roads never traveled. When I explored these roads, if I
never wrote anything down, I’d never remember anything. And for the
longest time, I didn’t.</p>

<p>If I ever felt I had the time to write something meaningful, I imagine
I’d use a kind of constructive process, involving the following:
themes, style, characters, relationships, plot elements &amp; form.  Keep
in mind that I’m keeping this focused on literature and that I also
have mostly no idea what I’m talking about.  Here, I’ll describe each
type of constructive element and later, I’ll enumerate over some
specific themes that interest me personally.</p>

<p><a name="themes"></a></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;" id="x2605-themesthemes-x2605">★ <a href="#themes">Themes</a> ★</h1>

<p>Of all the elements, the most important by far is theme.  This is
going to drive the internal dialogue of your readers and hopefully any
external discussion they have as well.  After all, art is much less so
what it is in itself and more so the sum of what it inspires in us.
There is no such thing as a “finished” work of art.  And thus, works
that don’t drive a dialogue and works that don’t make us ask new
questions or provide a new light with which to revisit old modes of
thinking: these works just don’t have as much depth. They are flat.</p>

<p><a name="timeless-and-universal-themes"></a></p>

<h3 id="timeless-and-universal-themestimeless-and-universal-themes"><a href="#timeless-and-universal-themes">Timeless and Universal Themes</a></h3>

<p>And for writing, the themes you choose and how you work with them,
this determines the depth of your work.  Some themes are more relevant
to some than others.  Some are played out, but might be fresh if you
provide a new lens.  There are many which seem relevant now, but whose
importance will soon fade.  These stories will likely vanish from the
pages of time.</p>

<p>Thus, it’s important to choose timeless and universally relevant
themes that everyone can value or appreciate. But what is universally
relevant and what is timeless?  As modern civilization continues to
progress towards the unknown at an exponential rate, it seems that
less and less would be timeless.  Or maybe some works will acquire an
air of timelessness as examples of the rapid development through the
21st century.  Perhaps novelty is better preserved with exponential
development.</p>

<p>A list of themes I would like to explore will be enumerated in part
two.</p>

<h4 id="illustration-from-the-12th-century-eadwine-psalterhttpsenwikipediaorgwikieadwinepsalter">Illustration from the 12th Century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadwine_Psalter">Eadwine Psalter</a></h4>

<p><a name="form"></a></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;" id="x2605-formform-x2605">★ <a href="#form">Form</a> ★</h1>

<p>What’s the overall form of the plot?  This is a major dependency of
all the elements. That is, changing the form will necessitate
reworking many aspects of everything else.</p>

<p>Your story isn’t just the collection of facts from the plot. It’s so
much more than that. It’s a journey that your readers will embark on
and no reader will ever set out on the same journey. Readers will form
very different interpretations of your work and you’ll find many
readers whose reactions to elements of your work will cluster
together.  As the artist, it’s your task to understand how those
various clusters will form and why. In other words, in what different
ways will people react to the same scene or character and why?</p>

<p>Choosing the appropriate form can either make or break a work.  The
form is the story, as the reader or viewer experiences it.  This needs
to be well thought out and strategically applied to your work.  By
structuring the form of your work, you can magnify the reader’s
emotional responses to some elements.  Done well enough and you’ll
find consumers want to re-experience your work, which is a far more
accurate measure of validation and valuation than the score on their
review, if they write one.</p>

<p>Some plot elements can have a much more dramatic effect if some of the
ending is revealed up to the reader up front – think Star Wars. This
totally changes how a reader will experience your story.  Instead of
looking forward into the complete unknown, your reader knows the
ending, or at least parts of it. There are these waypoints that must
be connected sometime in the future. Having these kinds of waypoints
will cause someone to be more invested in your story because their
mind is going to constantly reevaluate how the stories current
elements must connect to some events in the future.</p>

<p><a name="connecting-the-dots"></a></p>

<h3 id="connecting-the-dotsconnecting-the-dots"><a href="#connecting-the-dots">Connecting the Dots</a></h3>

<p>And so, their mind is always trying to connect the dots. This is just
generally true with the human mind: it speciallizes in this.  So give
it some far off points to extrapolate to and it will kick our mind
into high gear.  In particular, it will engage the reader or the
viewer’s imagination.  And this is much more interesting to our
subconscious mind, since it reconstructing the path from our current
place in the plot to the future is a problem that is at least
partially resolvable.  That is, as opposed to just iteratively
appending more plot details onto the existing storyline. There’s not
much work there for the subconscious mind.</p>

<p>Also, there are more advanced examples of form used in the Star Wars
trilogy, which is a ringed plot. It’s a trilogy of trilogies, began
in the middle of a ringed story. The “ringed” form is well known in
literature and Star Wars is like a meta-form of that.</p>

<p><a name="sequels-break-coherence-to-form"></a></p>

<h3 id="sequels-break-coherence-to-formsequels-break-coherence-to-form"><a href="#sequels-break-coherence-to-form">Sequels Break Coherence to Form</a></h3>

<p>Why is that that sequels don’t usually stand up to the first works?
Often, it’s because the author didn’t have another direction planned
for the work. The stories for the sequels feel “tacked on.” They seem
isolated or self-contained or, worse, stilted in how they are
interwoven into the original work. They might intertwine with the
previous work well, but the previous work lacks the ability to
intertwine as well with the sequel, depending on how the author left
openings for sequels.</p>

<p>At the same time, it can sometimes be cheesy when there’s a bit
written into the story and I immediately think “oh, I see, that’s
where they want to make this a trilogy.” But that’s better than
tacking on a self-contained sequel. Either way, the premise of
subsequent work has changed the work itself.  How does one construct a
story without planning on the sequel? Sometimes, it’s best to travel
hundreds of years in the past and explore some stories from a little
known part of the mythology for the original work.</p>

<p>Another better way, which embodies a kind of formlessness, is to
construct a story, adding in enough extraneous, unresolved material to
leave openings for connected works.  Done in the right way, this is a
technique that can add to the complexity of the original work and the
work should feel both homogenous and heterogenous. Think of one of
those automatic, contextual photoshop brushes.  How does it work? It
checks the surrounding area and fills in the pixes so nothing stands
out too much. This technique is a bit similar. And when you mixin
enough extraneous heterogenous detail into your story, it feels
natural. And when that’s not there, it feels constricted, just
barebones plot.</p>

<p>Sequels can change the meaning of the first work. It’d be hard for
<em>Star Wars Episode VII</em> to have quite the same effect as on someone
who waited nearly thirty years from the release of <em>Episode VI</em>. I’m
not at all saying there’s anything wrong with how JJ Abrams approached
the sequels, but it’s impossible for that work to have the same effect
as it did on people who grew up with the first six episodes.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s best to leave the reader or viewer seething with
unresolved tension. Other times, a story should begin and end. And
that’s it. You’ve explored the world. Time for a new story. This is
something I really like about anime and manga and I’ve written a post
about it before in
<a href="/posts/2015-01-27-lean-kanban-and-anime.html">Lean, Kanban and Anime</a>.
There are the franchises that return again and again, but there are so
many one off stories that last just a season or two.  This gives the
storytellers the chance to explore a set of characters and develop
them without abandon. If a show is going to be short, significant
characters can die or whatever. There’s less risk there and because of
that, the stories can have more varied developments.</p>

<p><a name="formlessness"></a></p>

<h3 id="formlessnessformlessness"><a href="#formlessness">Formlessness</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Longer_Human">No Longer Human</a>(1948)
by Osamu Dazai is an excellent example of formlessness. I haven’t read
it, but I’ve seen the anime based on it, which is part of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoi_Bungaku">Aoi Bungaku</a>, a collection
of japanese literature adapted to anime. It’s presumed to be partly
based on the life of Osamu Dazai, who committed suicide shortly after
publishing it. The anime follows the life of Oba Yozo after a
disastrously failed double suicide attempt and delves into his
childhood and his recovery from the failed suicide.</p>

<p>As for themes, it speaks powerfully about the role of the individual
in relation to society. There are several brilliant role reversals
woven into the work, especially towards the end, which are only made
possible by the form of the novel. It’s difficult to see these coming,
but they are pulled off just right and add a ton of depth to the
characters in the story. Two of the characters are so similar, yet so
distinctive.  Neither really fits into society and both are kind of
outcasts, but one is able to reconcile this, while the other makes a
few majestic steps forward and several equally tragic falls backward.</p>

<p>Only having experienced the anime, I think the story seems formless
because it’s partly based on the life of the author and thus,
traditional form is right out the window. Usually, stories adapted
from real events end up being shallow and one-sided. But here,
elements of form are woven in on top of the pieces of the author’s
life story, resulting in a very complex story about life with very
real characters. The end of the anime feels almost like the climax of
a chess game, where there are several pieces holding others in place
and everything suddenly unfolds, leaving almost nothing remaining.</p>

<p>As you decide on major and minor themes, you should begin thinking of
major and minor plot elements that would help you expose them.</p>

<p><a name="the-intersection-of-form-and-plot"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-intersection-of-form-and-plotthe-intersection-of-form-and-plot"><a href="#the-intersection-of-form-and-plot">The Intersection of Form and Plot</a></h3>

<p>It’s the intersection of form and plot that allows for plausible
alternate explanations to a storyline.  Again, this is a priceless
tool for getting your reader to engage and invest in your story. It’s
going to cause them to reevaluate the characters, again and
again. Placing your characters in situations where the character
misunderstands them and makes mistakes and getting the reader to
misevaluate the storyline: that is powerful storytelling that can
cause the reader to reevaluate what they know of their own reality, as
well as your fantasy. It’s especially important to look for form and
plot that allow for plausible alternate explanations.  So writers need
to be capable of identifying duplicitous scenarious or portraying
scenarious in such a way that allows for duplicitous explanations.</p>

<p><a name="tropes"></a></p>

<h3 id="tropestropes"><a href="#tropes">Tropes</a></h3>

<p>There are generic kinds of events and events that are genericizeable
which can allow a writer to enumerate reusable scenarios for minor
plot events.  And major plot twists as well.  These are like tropes
and using the same ones over and over can be a bit annoying. Yet, some
tropes are incredibly useful for exploring specific themes, like
betrayal.  You might even say that a particular trope would be
required for exploring some themes.  In order to explore epic
betrayal, you need a character that betrays another in an epic way.
And to explore that to the full effect, you need minor events in your
story that establish a trusting relationship between the two.</p>

<p>Category theory is great for kind of genericizing plot events or
stories from real life. You can take some memories or stories you’ve
heard and just abstract the characters or combinate &amp; reapply the same
“type” of scenario with different characters until you find something
interesting. But being able to identify those kinds of compelling
events and types of events from real life and from other stories is
the skill here. What types of events would be most interesting when
applied to different characters and situations.</p>

<p><a name="ai-driven-literature"></a></p>

<h3 id="ai-driven-literatureai-driven-literature"><a href="#ai-driven-literature">AI-driven Literature</a></h3>

<p>In terms of getting an AI algorithm to write literature or movies, one
challenge is managing the interweaved web of dependencies between
major/minor plot scenarios. And the big challenge is to get an
algortihm to weave those events together for some higher purpose that
allows the work to inspire in its readers a discussion about life
itself.</p>

<p>There has been a ton of work put into this. AI has been trained on
academic papers, political speeches and screenplays. AI even wrote
this screenplay
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2016/06/an-ai-wrote-this-movie-and-its-strangely-moving/">Sunscreen</a>,
which was produced and completed. There’s still a lot of work to be
done. N-gram models are way too simple. Sequence-to-sequence is used
in a lot of work with language, but that’s still not going to cut
it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the next paragraph, just think: “Watson” retired from IBM and
kicking our ass at jeopardy to write novels. And his memoirs. That’s
basically all I’m saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any neural network that doesn’t actually process the semantics in the
language of the text into a model based on information and knowledge
isn’t going to be able to do much. Most AI algorithms that process
text and language rely on the frequency of words, but don’t venture
too far into semantics. And what I’m thinking about is a network that
takes the facts and information and plot movement contained in the
semantics and then constructs a neural network based on that. It then
mulls over clusters of higher-order data and produces something novel
… which is punny if you think about it.</p>

<p>The best use for AI in writing for now is for the exploratory process:
it’d be great at combinating through scenarios for characters,
chaining them together and then passing control to screenwriters or
focus groups or something. These higher-order events can be abstracted
from the kind of knowledge and information that Watson
aggregates. These higher-order events can be linked together.  Just
visualized one of those massive old-school synthesizers, with all the
patch cords chaining various modules together.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;" id="x2605-characters--relationshipscharacters-x2605">★ <a href="#characters">Characters &amp; Relationships</a> ★</h1>

<p>Behind themes, your characters, their relationships and the
development of both might be the most important parts. They will help
you elucidate your themes. IMO, ideating all of this is some the
hardest part of the creative process for literature and screenplays,
besides the hard work of writing and editing a book or screen
play. It’s all so ephemeral. It can shift so easily. What if you think
you have a good story, but you get a few months into thinking it out
… and it just doesn’t work?</p>

<p>Your characters must feel real in not just your mind, but in how they
appear to others as well. Almost like an actor, you must be able to
simulate their personality in your mind. And others should be able to
as well. What would these characters do? How would they dress? Why?
How does their appearance affect their behavior? Their position in
their society and their personality, how does that contrast with the
social norms of various strata? Why? Why is that important to
painting the picture of your world?  What is it that is going to
resonate with readers and viewers? Why? What would make your readers
and viewers want to cosplay this character? What is going to be
controversial and are those controversial elements relateable?</p>

<p>Some characters, you will need to create as you need them for just one
or two scenes, but that doesn’t mean they’re not worth investing
energy into. Sometimes these characters are the best because you don’t
have to worry about maintaining them and so you can contort their
personality and traits a bit more for a bit of literary chiaroscuro.</p>

<p>What makes your characters real? What traits, mores and values do your
fantasy realm’s people share that must be universal, with even our own
world? And for every one of these questions: ask why!  No, ask
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">Five Why’s</a>! By the way, Five
Why’s is basically the application of pullbacks, which I’ll cover in
just a second. The apparel that your character wears, what is its
purpose to their world?  Does form fit the function? Or is it just
extraneous baggage? What hero wants to dress up every day with with
crap that is mere baggage?  Maybe there’s a story behind that ring or
that leather piece? Who knows.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2016-06-23-if-i-had-the-chops-to-write-my-daedalian-magnum-corpus/ergo-proxy-awakening.png" alt="Ergo Proxy Re-l Mayer" /></p>

<p>What is this character’s comfort zone? And what happens when they get
harshly placed outside it? Do they react realistically? Do they
change? What provokes their change? Or does the character, a high
class princess that’s never seen a fleck of dirt, just magically adapt
to circumstances she couldn’t psychologically tolerate? Because that
wouldn’t be “realistic” which is a pretty fun term to toss around when
referring to fantasy realms. Yet, you want to construct this realm in
the mind of your viewer, so you want all the details to be coherent.
You want them to construct this world in their mind because they want
to escape our common reality, which is quite boring. So you owe it to
them to flesh it out. On the other hand, you need to give yourself
room for flexibility: don’t flesh out so many details if it’s going to
be a problem to be stuck with them.</p>

<p><a name="three-dimensional-characters"></a></p>

<h3 id="three-dimensional-charactersthree-dimensional-characters"><a href="#three-dimensional-characters">Three-Dimensional Characters</a></h3>

<p>And so, to get “three-dimensional characters,” I’ll again return to
category theory – this time to <strong>pullbacks</strong>.  It’s more useful to
let the reader construct their version of the character in their head
because if you try to do it for them, it’s going to feel forced and
stilted. Try to avoid describing the events and details at the
surface.</p>

<p>So to sculpt these more authentic characters, you find that writers
will mix one of two strategies. Both are necessary, though the first
is much better IMO.  First, they may strategically filter what is
described at the surface and use that to allow you to imagine what
must lie below.  And secondly, they may attempt to directly describe
the thoughts and inner feelings of the characters to articulate how a
reader should perceive the surface details. This is necessary when you
want to make sure that your reader is thinking about certain things
when a scene is unfolding. It’s like putting text in bold. Sometimes
you want to do that.</p>

<p>And you have to take the limitations of your medium into account. A
movie only has a running time of 90 - 120 minutes, tops. You need to
change how you develop your characters so you can do it faster, unless
your character is already fairly well known, like a comic book
superhero or something.</p>

<p><a name="pullbacks-and-character-development"></a></p>

<h3 id="pullbacks-and-character-developmentpullbacks-and-character-development"><a href="#pullbacks-and-character-development">Pullbacks and Character Development</a></h3>

<p>Try to refrain from techniques like expository dialogue, <em>especially
if you’re using it to expose emotional state!</em> LOL, definitely don’t
do that.</p>

<p>So, instead use the category theory concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_(category_theory)">pullbacks</a>. And
please note, this concept doesn’t really map up one-to-one with the
concept with category theory, but I think I can illustrate some
important points about both by illustrating with this analogy. And
yeh, it’s abstract non-sense mathematic mumbo jumbo, but I can break
it down. You’ll see that it’s simple and relevant.</p>

<h4 id="pullback-diagram">Pullback Diagram</h4>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2016-06-23-if-i-had-the-chops-to-write-my-daedalian-magnum-corpus/category-theory-pullback.png" alt="Category Theory Pullback" /></p>

<p>So, <code>P</code> and <code>Z</code> are your reader’s perceptions of the character
<code>Alice</code>, before and after some character development. Lets say that
<code>Z</code> is your character after some transformative event that makes your
reader think <code>Alice</code> is greedy and shortsighted.  To make the analogy
to category theory more clear (this isn’t really important) then <code>P -&gt;
X -&gt; Z</code> and <code>P -&gt; Y -&gt; Z</code> represent the transformations of <code>greedy</code>
and <code>shortsighted</code>, in either order.  Whether or not you apply the
functions <code>greedy</code> or <code>shortsighted</code> first or second doesn’t matter,
you still reach a place <code>Z</code> where the reader perceives both are true
about <code>Alice</code>.  But if you just do it this way, it’s the equivalent of
writing <code>The character Alice is greedy and shortsighted</code>. Boring,
right? But that is the goal. You need the reader to believe that
<code>Alice</code> is these things.</p>

<p>So a pullback is a transformation of <code>P -&gt; X -&gt; Z</code> and <code>P -&gt; Y -&gt; Z</code>
so that you can go from <code>Q -&gt; X -&gt; Z</code> or <code>Q -&gt; Y -&gt; Z</code>. And there is
the implied existence of a function <code>u</code> that transforms <code>Q -&gt; P</code>. What
is important is that you have pulled back from the overly simple
statement <code>The character Alice is greedy and shortsighted</code> and
obfuscated that with a situation or event that allows the reader to
understand that. These pullbacks are also useful for genericizing
types of events and situations, so that they could be reapplied to
other characters.</p>

<p>And so, these kind of pullbacks are essential to writing literature in
such a way that allows the reader theirself to search for your
meaning.  It makes it a bit harder, so that they spend more time and
energy trying to understand your art.  These kinds of pullbacks also
make your art a bit ambiguous.  It’s clear you wanted to spark a
dialogue on <code>greed</code> and <code>myopia</code>, but now your readers need to discuss
amongst themselves what you actually wanted to say. When truly, you
wanted them to explore these themes or character traits because they
are complex and the reason you thought about them enough to inspire
art in the first place is because there is no “right” answer. Art that
is so direct &amp; obvious doesn’t inspire enough discussion and
investment of energy to last.</p>

<p><a name="anonymized-characters"></a></p>

<h3 id="anonymized-charactersanonymized-characters"><a href="#anonymized-characters">Anonymized Characters</a></h3>

<p>There is a kind of merger of characters with the mathematic concept of
type theory. Don’t freak out! Type theory is basically Mad Libs.
That’s all. If you want to get fancy, think Mad Libs with tree-like
data structures.</p>

<p>Type theory sounds overly abstract, but it’s applicable to writing and
the creative process. Type theory can be applied to both the
situations you’re character will be in as well as to the characters
themselves. It allows you to compare and specify parallels between the
structures of data, in this case characters and events. In computer
science, type theory is very useful for functional programming. If you
were to model literature you would find yourself discovering a ton of
connections to category theory, as we already have.</p>

<p>For the situations you want to use to highlight your chosen themes,
you’re going to need characters to fill various roles. If your
characters are pulling off a heist and one of them gets left behind,
it could be any of them, but why should you pick each one? The role is
the character that needs to be left behind, which is necessary for
some future element of the plot. If your characters pull off a series
of heists, there might be similar features shared between all of them:
specific events or roles for a character to fulfill.</p>

<p>So, if you’ve enumerated these generic situations and plot movements
that you want to use to construct your plot, then you can also create
anonymized characters to attach to specific situations.  This way, you
can evaluate characters for that role in that situation to find the
best fit.  Changing characters that are part of a scene can have
ramifications on dependencies to the story. E.G. the character that
gets left behind in the heist was originally supposed to be in a scene
just a bit later on, but now that’s a plot hole and a dependency issue
to be resolved.</p>

<p>But anonimyzing the characters that are part of your scenes allows you
to be a bit more flexible with your story.  Because the imposition
limitations often sparks creativity, then by evaluating which
characters make the most sense for each scene and resolving the
dependency issues that arise by creating explanatory scenes, you’re
actually augmenting your creative capacity. I’ve always found that
imposed limitations cause me to be much more creative than usual.</p>

<p>And so, if you have these anonimyzed characters, you might specify
some of their actions and reactions in specific scenes, but because
you haven’t decided their identity, you can always merge them with
other characters to some extent.  E.G. well for scene A, we need a
heroic character that can rappel onto a balcony to save the day and
that matches up with character B.</p>

<p><a name="character-archetypes"></a></p>

<h3 id="character-archetypescharacter-archetypes"><a href="#character-archetypes">Character Archetypes</a></h3>

<p>Ahhh the tsundere. Who doesn’t love a good tsundere? Anime shows often
seem to have one. It’s the character, usually a girl, who acts like
she doesn’t approve of our unlikely hero. She remains cold and
distant, but why?! And gradually they grow close after the hero proves
himself in some way.</p>

<p>These character archetypes are all over the place. There’s the distant
mystic. The thief with a heart of gold. The homeless guy who’s seen
everything. The evil stepmom. The unlikely hero. The valiant
prince. The trickster. They’re all over literature and it’s nearly
impossible to create characters that break these molds. You have to be
familiar with them because you’re inevitably going to copy traits from
them whether you know it or not. You can try to combine one or more
archetypes, but that’s not such a great approach. A good idea would be
to practice creating characters that embody these archetypes in some
way. If you can master that, then you should know how to create
characters that differ from them in some significant way.</p>

<p>Greek mythology and other ancient traditions are a great source of
stories about characters that seem to best embody these
archetypes. And I wonder: is that because they are the most pure
implementations of these archetypes? Or is it because they were some
of the first and everything is based on them?</p>

<p>Cultures have evolved over time, as have people and the personality
types and metatypes they embody. So has literature; myths have
evolved and so has the way we tell them. Storytellers have found that
one of the best ways to change a story is to change how they present
the narrative to the reader, the listener, the viewer.</p>

<p>New technologies open up new ways of telling old stories.  Higher
bandwidth, instantaneous communication has given us the flat world of
modernization, where everyone and every culture is essentially on the
same playing field.  Or rather, we seem to be eternally moving in that
direction. The total quantity of information that is shared between
the entire world has never been higher and so we have also changed the
way we share information.</p>

<p>Further, this society urges the individual to stand out. So in that
regard, modernization has encouraged writers to be creative in how
they tell stories. The turn of the 20th century gave us stream of
consciousness for example. People were in the middle of the
intellectual and cultural revolution that would pave the way for the
technological and philosophical developments of the 20th century. We
were beginning to understand then mind, body and world like never
before. The variety of writing styles that were put into publication
underscore this and reflect the liberalization of control over
publication.</p>

<p><a name="literary-style"></a></p>

<h1 id="literary-styleliterary-style"><a href="#literary-style">Literary Style</a></h1>

<p>So what is literary style? Style seems to mesh together the other
literary elements. Style evolves over time and follows trends. Style
is how a writer chooses to tell a story. Experienced writers will
consciously embed elements of style throughout their work’s
creation. They might have developed their own distinctive style, but
they wouldn’t tell you that. That limits other people’s scope of
perspectives, when looking at their work.</p>

<p>Literary style includes the language an author chose to use. That
vocabulary includes cultural connections and evokes imagery, so style
includes that imagery inspired by the use of language. It includes the
overall format of the work. The author has a choice over the level of
clarity they provide and what they choose to focus on. The narration
can vary per chapter or per character as well, so that focus or
perspective can change over a work. Some authors and works rely on a
lot of wordplay. This is difficult to pull off well and those
connections can be lost over time.</p>

<p>Style includes how an author chooses to develop their characters and
the level of parallelism and connectedness in their characters. In
other words, the form an author uses or the themes they explore are
best highlighted when there is a connection between movements in
character development.</p>

<p><a name="temporality-and-ordinality"></a></p>

<h3 id="temporality-and-ordinalitytemporality-and-ordinality"><a href="#temporality-and-ordinality">Temporality and Ordinality</a></h3>

<p>Some works employ a kind of temporal variation, a distortion of time
in where events or the experience thereof can shift with respect to
time.  Ordinal variation refers to variation in order itself. In fact,
every book employs temporal and ordinal variation to some degree
because there is no sense of time in words on paper. They are just
words on paper, chapters in a book. There is no time there. The only
sense of time arises from how a reader explores the pages in the
book. The reader provides that sense of time by consuming the
work. Authors need to be well aware of how it feels to read their own
work. Thinking about other people actually reading your writing sparks
motivation to write differently.  I don’t want to change my art for
others, but it’d be a lot cooler if others enjoyed consuming it.</p>

<p><a name="causality-and-cardinality"></a></p>

<h3 id="causality-and-cardinalitycausality-and-cardinality"><a href="#causality-and-cardinality">Causality and Cardinality</a></h3>

<p>Another similar techniques employ variation in cardinality and
causality. Distorting cardinality requires distorting how people
perceive a collection of literature or the ideas in a book by changing
the sets of ideas that people group together. We see this a lot with
reboots: people want the franchise to be rebooted, so they can relive
the myths they love as though they were new again. <em>Just a little bit
of this</em> is <em>great</em>. Just a little bit. Too much rockin’ of the
foundations is a bad thing. This style of cardinal distortion can be
contained to a single work.</p>

<p>And by distorting causality, some seriously cool Dr. Strange ish
becomes possible. In other words, by breaking logic or altering the
structure of ideas brought to life by words, new possibilities are
available. This aspect of <em>Virtual Reality</em> excites me. No, it is not
the simulation of reality that stimulates my imagination. It is that
the very foundations of reality can be broken and a coherent world can
be made and consumed viscerally. The rules of physics can be
remade. And this can be done with fiction, writing and cinema as
well. This is what frustrates me about first person shooters and other
overly realistic video games. Why would you want to escape to a
simulated version of reality that almost exactly mirrors the version
of reality that you know?</p>

<p>One place where you see causality broken is the Legend of Zelda.  I
stopped bothering trying to figure that plot out around Windwaker.
LMAO. But the truth is – or my personal take on the series – it’s a
legend. What you are playing through is not a single epic saga. You
are experiencing the story as a legend. You are living it as it is
told and retold. And that is so awesome. It’s also very freeing in
that the series of the Legend of Zelda can go in any direction they
want. They are very flexible in this regard. And I think the way
they’ve chosen to explore that universe is pure brilliance because it
totally broken rank from all the other video games from the
nineties. It was perplexing because I couldn’t figure out what the
overall story was. But I love it because it’s basically the same story
every time with different characters and different situations, yet
specific elements are held to be the same, so it feels like the same
myth. Sometimes the entire world is flooded, sometimes it’s not. But
there’s always a master sword, a triforce and a hero of time.</p>

<h3 id="differential-style-and-orthogonalitydifferential-style-and-orthogonality"><a href="#differential-style-and-orthogonality">Differential Style and Orthogonality</a></h3>

<p>Speaking of breaking rank, this brings me to another point: how does
an artist’s work fit in with other art at the time? This matters more
at the time a piece of art was created and will always be relevant to
some extent, but that relevance fades away, leaving the true spirit of
the art. Some of the best art is orthogonal to current trends. That
is, the art understood what was happening at the time, but its message
was completely different in some way. Or delivered in a completely
different way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the mathematically uninitiated, orthogonality is like trying to
plot something on an X &amp; Y axis, yet completely missing the point in
some way because the data needs to be visualized on the Z axis to be
fully understood. That’s what it means for some relationship to be
orthogonal: it’s “statistically independent.” And technically, it is
the concept of perpendicularity extended to more than 2 dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you are always judging art by its relationship to other current
pieces – which is important, don’t get me wrong – then you are
probably missing the point. There is no maximally best way of looking
at art, of course. But you can usually identify a great piece of art
when it prompts you to remark “wow, this is so different from
everything else right now.”  That’s a bit self-contradictory because
I’ve just said it’s best to judge art for the piece of art itself, not
the artist and not the art trend.  Still, in order to really recognize
how something is different from an artists work, you have to look at
that artist’s other pieces.  To really recognize a piece of art that
breaks trends or breaks some other deeply established concept, you
have to know how that art differs from other pieces of art. So in that
regard, to judge something for itself requires judging it in context
of everything else. To some reasonable degree of course; the best way
to look at art critically is to not look at it critically at all.</p>

<p>But my point is: this concept of style where the artist or author
stands against the flowing currents of recent trends, that is an
element of style in itself. And often, it’s a very brave one.</p>

<p><a name="cohesive-style"></a></p>

<h3 id="cohesive-stylecohesive-style"><a href="#cohesive-style">Cohesive Style</a></h3>

<p>When you apply style to a work, which kind you apply and how much
should seem uniformly embedded in the work, instead of a late idea or
something that requires a ton of edits and reworks. Or it should at
least seem like style that was conscientiously applied and for good
reason. There is a spectrum to the quantity and type of style applied
to a work.  There is a moreso “major” application of a type of style
where that style permeates the work. And there are more “minor”
applications of style, which might be more a result of the period of
time the work was created than a result of the artist’s intent.</p>

<p><a name="when-style-fuels-artistry"></a></p>

<h1 id="when-style-fuels-artistrywhen-style-fuels-artistry-1"><a href="#when-style-fuels-artistry">When Style Fuels Artistry</a></h1>

<p>But the best kind of work: you’ll notice something. The style the
writer or director pursued feeds back into the work, somehow. Maybe it
was this author’s distinctive style or perhaps a style that embodies
their philosophy, but if fuels the artistic merit of the work. Nowhere
is this more perfectly executed, I think, than in Birdman. In this
movie, the style of filming is so perfectly reflected back into the
nature of its artistic statements.</p>

<p><a name="birdman"></a></p>

<h3 id="birdmanbirdman"><a href="#birdman">Birdman</a></h3>

<p>The one-shot take in birdman isn’t just an technological
accomplishment. It’s not just a novelty or gimmick for the film. This
is a spectacular example of the use of style to ad depth to the
work. The one-shot view highlights the differences between the nature
of acting for cinema and for theatre. In a movie about theature. But
it doesn’t end there.</p>

<p>This is a movie that makes powerful statements about life &amp; death,
about an actor’s failing career and his attempt at a comeback. His
career is totally controlled by other people’s perceptions of him. The
way they look at him and paint him determines his available
opportunities and I’ve been stuck in that same exact spot, time and
time again. It’s his attempt to break the mold that his previous work
forced him into. And, like <em>Hamilton</em>, he’s got one shot to do it.
This is his chance. That is it. It’s high stakes.</p>

<p>The one-shot take revisits some of the same scenes and situations in
the play, from rehersal to showtime. This is a statement about the
nature of life itself. How often do we find ourselves revisiting the
same problems in life? I know I have several times. It’s like a video
game and here I am on the same level again. Life is asking me to
evolve or restart at the last checkpoint.</p>

<h3 id="some-spoilers-below">Some Spoilers Below</h3>

<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Birdman shifts from the mundane life of an actor trying to regain
control of his career to his epic, surreal dreamlike fantasies, where
he asserts control over reality by defying its rules. In most film,
there’s a sharp, visual break between a scene that is reality and
fantasy. Because there’s no such break in birdman, this makes it very
difficult for me to understand where reality begins and fantasy
ends. This makes the nature of the film difficult to pin down, as no
one interpretation of it really fits. Did he die, in the end? Was the
ending, was his comeback a fantasy? I don’t know. It’s a powerful
statement about suicide, in that again, you only have one shot at
life. If he did die, as the film allows us to briefly believe, then he
never could have enjoyed the comeback.</p>

<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Also, the film explores how an artist or actor presents themselves to
the world by contrasting the world backstage with the visual imagery
of the audience. This divide is emphasized in the marching band scene,
which is presented to us the unfortunate accident of a nerve-wrecked
actor who bums a cigarette to calm his nerves before that final
scene. And he’s nearly stripped naked in the middle of Times Square,
where he’s dodging in and out of a marching band as he scrambles to
return to the theatre. There couldn’t be more perfect symbolism. He
defies the expectation of the audience of the play and the film by
winging it back on stage. The actors in the play didn’t see it coming
either. He returns to the stage from practically left field, but the
character on stage is not an actor. Instead he bears his true self in
front of everyone, in what is perhaps a fatal mistake.</p>

<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">And, amoung the points I think the film tries to make, is that such a
tightly constraining set of habits for one’s personal life is
destructive. That, by never bearing his soul to anyone and restricted
by being defined by others, he had found himself cornered. If only he
could have show his true self to others sooner, but if others weren’t
misunderstanding him through their distorted perspective, then his
guard was up, especially when the stakes were high.  And we, as the
audience of the film get to see what his life would have been like,
were he not to have died, which is a brave statement on suicide, I
think. Because wouldn’t we like to see a reality where he struggled
and succeeded? I don’t believe that’s what “really happened.”</p>

<p>And, so I think the point of the film is that we should be a little
less guarded. We should be more willing to show our true selves. We
need to cry out when we need help, because our lifes get further
contorted. It shouldn’t be difficult for us to do this in our
society. It’s hard enough.</p>

<h3 id="jackie-brownjackie-brown"><a href="#jackie-brown">Jackie Brown</a></h3>

<p>This is another great movie and, even though it’s one of his earlier
films, I think exemplifies Quentin Tarantino’s style. What I noticed
was that, it was everything onscreen was necessary for the film to say
exactly what it was trying to say. And it was projected in just the
right perspective. Everything that was there was needed in order to
develop the characters. It manages to funnel the audience through a
very consistent experience, I think. And it does so by tightly
controlling the composition of the scenes and the presentation/order
of the scenes.</p>

<p>And by doing this, Tarantino is creating a consistent experience
amoung his audience, which is very difficult to do. People have very
diverse backgrounds and when you’re directing, you have to understand
how diverse audiences are going to respond to specific scenes. How is
a scene or character is going to make someone feel? If a viewer had
one type of response, how would they feel about this plot/character
development? Would that compel them to enjoy that moment?</p>

<p><a name="infinite-jest"></a></p>

<h3 id="infinite-jestinfinite-jest"><a href="#infinite-jest">Infinite Jest</a></h3>

<p>This is a book I barely started, so I can’t say too much. I know that
the book is written out of order, using the distorted ordinality I
referenced above. I’m sure there’s a more appropriate term for
this. Even still, the stories that are included are from various
characters viewpoints and are eventually woven together. This is a
book I’d like to read, but I don’t read as much as I should.</p>

<h4 id="the-title-for-infinite-jest-comes-from-hamlet">The Title for Infinite Jest Comes from Hamlet</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of <em>infinite jest</em>,
of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand
times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the Wikipedia page, it’s noted that David Foster Wallace mentions
that “the answers all [exist], but just past the last page.”</p>

<p>Another book I need to finish, but so far I’ve noticed that the use of
language is remarkable, as are the allusions to other pieces of
art. The novel’s only some 150 pages long, but I feel like I need to
research all the symbolism as I’m reading it or understanding the
novel is hopeless.</p>

<p><a name="on-the-road"></a></p>

<h3 id="on-the-roadon-the-road"><a href="#on-the-road">On the Road</a></h3>

<p>This novel set the tone for the sixties. One of my favorite books, it
was written by Kerouac in the span of three weeks. On a road
trip. This novel was written at just the right, spectacular moment of
American history, when it had just become possible and economically
feasilbe for the average American to travel the continent. This novel
embodies the spirit of the impetous road trip, extemporaneously
declared by the drunken ramblings of the night before, yet decisively
acted on to lead youth on a improvised journey of serindipitous
discovery. I love it.</p>

<p>The economic conditions of the late fifties and the sixties permitted
this exhilirating exploration of American and the ensuing cultural
transformation. The stage had been set and that generation lived out
adventures that will remain forever unparalleled. When I remember that
we can never again return to that moment, I cry a little bit. Where we
are going is just as great and I wish we could return America to such
simpler times.</p>

<p>But again, On the Road? Artistic treasure. The style, the action of
the writing, everything feeds into it’s own message. And from it, the
American legend of Neal Cassidy was born.</p>

<p><a name="canterbury-tales"></a></p>

<h3 id="canterbury-talescanterbury-tales"><a href="#canterbury-tales">Canterbury Tales</a></h3>

<p>This is a collection of stories from the 14th and 15th centuries from
Geoffrey Chaucer. Each story is told by a pilgrim on their way to
Canterbury from London. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miller%27s_Tale">Miller’s Tale</a> is
particularly amusing. The pilgrims are from various walks of life and
this gives us a good idea of what 14th century life was like in
England as well as an idea of what these people might have wanted life
to be like.</p>

<p>But this collection of stories is a mechanic used over and over again
throughout history. Sin City, the graphic novel and the film, uses it
and weaves together a great story. The anime Death Parade also uses
this technique to explore the lives of people in their most final
moments.</p>

<p><a name="ghost-in-the-shell"></a></p>

<h3 id="ghost-in-the-shellghost-in-the-shell"><a href="#ghost-in-the-shell">Ghost in the Shell</a></h3>

<p>I recently watched a critique on Ghost in the Shell that discussed the
importance of a few minutes of the film with wide shots from different
angles and variously sized viewing frustums. Looking at the animation
in the footage, some of this was pretty expensive to create. There’s a
lot of motion and a ton of effort went into these
scenes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdwriter1">NerdWriter1</a>, who has some
other great analyses, highlights the importance of these scenes for
establishing a connection to this futuristic world. He notes that
these scenes through time out the window in favor for focusing on
space. He draws some parallels to the difference between japanese
manga and american comics. In particular, he notes that action
progresses differently between frames in manga, where there is a bit
more focus on frames that only depict the world. He then argues that
this is connected to connecting the viewer to the source and sense of
identity that these inhabitants of the future experience.</p>

<p>The relationship of identity in a world of constant technological
evolution is is paramount for us to understand. This is something
society needs to explore and understand before it happens. It’s
important theme of the series, which is a frighteningly accurate
depiction of tech in the future. And here, the usage of style in
composition feeds back into the artistic intent of this series, though
not nearly as meta as with Birdman.</p>

<p><a name="my-own-style"></a></p>

<h1 id="my-own-stylemy-own-style-1"><a href="#my-own-style">My Own Style</a></h1>

<p>I haven’t been writing for long. I have some great ideas. There’s a
ton of topics I could write on for non-fiction and I have a few good
fiction ideas as well. I have some specific ideas for a world I want
to create, but I’m not sure what medium is best. I think video games
or VR might be best. But I need to work a lot on style. I’d hate to
piss away some of this content by trying to make it the first thing I
tackle with my writing.</p>

<p>Similar to how bright colors and intense patterns could detract from
the message in a painting, your style could detract from your story,
so it needs to be tactfully applied. In my own non-fiction articles on
<a href="http://te.xel.io">te.xel.io</a>, I choose to be conversational because
this is my writing and my message. I am not writing because I want
someone to read it. Often my topics and ideas are overly
complicated. I discussed category theory in this blog post, for
example. I write about too many topics and my posts are too long!  A
marketing professional would find it quite a challenge to promote my
blog in its existing form. I’ve been directly told and indirectly
hinted that my content is “too complicated” and that it’s just “way
too long” and “way too many words.” HAHAHAHA LMAO!!</p>

<p>The jokes on you. this is my writing and I am writing for myself. I’ll
be damned if I disappear without having ever written down my
thoughts. And no, I do not want to limit myself chasing short-term
goals like increased likes and more retweets and more shares. My blog
is not a growth hack. To me, there could be no bigger mistake than
changing the nature of my message by limiting the scope and especially
the length of my posts to hope that someone shares it. I do not
care. I’m looking at the analytics and people are reading my
stuff. People are finishing these long-winded, complicated posts.</p>

<p>At the same time, I need to work on improving my style. I want my
content to be well organized and I want my message to be focused. Like
I noted earlier, revisiting my own writing and imagining it through
the eyes of someone else has motivated me to work on my style.</p>

<p><a name="style-experimentation"></a></p>

<h3 id="style-experimentationstyle-experimentation"><a href="#style-experimentation">Style Experimentation</a></h3>

<p>So if style is so important for conveying a message and especially for
making your work stand out, how do you improve it? Reading is a good
start, especially when you are constantly evaluating an authors
message and constrasting it with their delivery, while applying that
to the context of your own writing, ideas and delivery.</p>

<p>Another good place is seeking creative writing projects. This is a
good way to challenge yourself to write a short story or essay, while
consciously employing an unfamiliar style. To do this, you have to be
aware of your options. I’ve learned that the best dancer can dance
with any style, the best actor can act with any style and the best
writer can write with any style. That is, they are experts, not by
mastery of their own style, but by understanding all styles and
cultivating a familiarity with all of them. It’s not crucial to be a
master of everything. If we all tried to be the best at everything, we
ought to never bother at all. But by at least understanding the innate
nature of all kind of things, we can reapply what we learn from one
area to another.</p>

<p>And the most important thing to remember is that the most proficient
experts in any given field are not limited by their options! If you
find yourself bested in some arena of skill, you wouldn’t want it to
happen because you ran out of options, would you? Everyone needs to be
well rounded, but the very root of all strategy is drawn from having
options. From maintaining flexibility. This is a lesson on the nature
of strategy itself, formiing it’s core, that can be applied to any
game, any field, any industry, anything.</p>

<p>Because writing involves communication of a message about people, then
wouldn’t it be best to know people? This is another skill that I feel
fairly proficient with, yet one that I badly need to work on. Being an
outsider, I have a completely different perspective on people. Being a
perfectionist, I feel compelled to keep trying until I find the piece
of knowledge I’m searching for.</p>

<h1 id="part-two---specific-themes">Part Two - Specific Themes</h1>

<p>In the next part, I’m going to list some specific themes I’d like to
write about. Some of these are quite depressing, but I feel like life
has blessed me with a wide variety of experience, people and
places. I’d always love to travel more though.</p>

<p>These themes include ideas on betrayal, compassion, deception,
paradox, fate, fame, war, art, wisdom, idealism, mortality, memory,
freedom, salvation, philosophy, history, self-discovery, power,
misunderstanding, confusion, temptation, and fear.</p>

<p>The majority of these themes I wrote down in just one night.  I knew
the story I wanted to tell and the lessons I’d learned, but I couldn’t
even begin. So instead, I thought to write down all the themes I
wanted to write about.</p>
