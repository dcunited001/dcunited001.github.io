<h2 id="other-new-ideas">Other new ideas.</h2>

<h2 id="content-from-2016">Content from 2016</h2>

<p>Ars Technica recently posted an article on
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/spotting-dark-matter-by-the-way-it-moves/">an exciting new development in dark matter</a>
and this piqued my interest on the subject. Another article I just saw
on
<a href="http://gizmodo.com/rumor-mill-heats-up-again-for-discovery-of-gravitationa-1757513741">Gizmodo teases a Nobel-worthy revelation on gravity waves</a>. I’ve
had a lot of questions about dark matter and gravity that my current
understanding of physics can’t answer. Again, yet another subject
where my understanding of math limits me.</p>

<h3 id="nobel-worthy-gravity-waves">Nobel Worthy Gravity Waves</h3>

<p>The Gizmodo article mentions a possible Nobel-worthy discovery of
gravity waves.  Apparently a binary blackhole merger has been
discovered, which is one of the few events that would produce gravity
waves detectable by current means.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-gravity-is-wierd">TL;DR; Gravity is Wierd</h3>

<p>As far as I can see, understanding gravity necessitates a shift in how
we model space.  I’ve used a few thought experiments to help simplify
the important pieces.  Here’s a few of the more profound questions
escaping me at the moment.  I wish I knew more of the math and physics
to understand this more completely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Update:</strong> I started looking further into some of the questions
that I asked and found that these are indeed very relevant issues to
be discussed.  Frustratingly, I have again found that my intuition
is particularly accurate here - frighteningly so, considering I
dropped out of university physics.  Yet, at the moment, I lack the
mathematics to pursue further inquiry, even though I suck it up like
a sponge - it’s easy because every new term maps to a familiar, but
unnamed concept I’ve explored on my own.  For most of the questions
that I’ve asked, the answers have not yet been conclusively
determined.</p>

  <p>I may update some of the questions in the future, to map my
exploration to existing concepts.  I used the word ‘frighteningly’
above for a reason.  In particular,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_invariant_special_relativity">de Sitter Invariant Special Relativity</a>
represents an approach to answering many issues that confounded me
in this article.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_special_relativity">Doubly Special Relativity</a>
was another interesting topic because some of the approaches used
model spacetime with ‘momentum space’ instead of position space. I
didn’t mention this in the article, but I got the feeling certain
issues with relativity can only conclusively be resolved using
momentum, yet I couldn’t really elaborate on why that was.  Like I
said, it was a feeling.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_geometry">Quantum Geometry</a>
is being developed to resolve how interactions are processed at
lengths relevant to the Planck Length, though it’s implemented
differently for each theory of Quantum Gravity.</p>

  <p>My point is, someone with my education shouldn’t be able to
understand much of this, beyond the typical summarization of high
level information from <em>A Brief History of Time</em>. Yet, dipping into
the math and specific theories, I’m able to pick some of this up
without anyone guiding me along.</p>

  <p>And I now understand why Quantum Gravity is so difficult. The
approaches are so diverse, varied and intricate. The experimental
evidence for Quantum Gravity isn’t there, nor will it be anytime
soon, so all we have to go on is theory, hoping that we’ll get
indirect clues from further experiments. The biggest missing element
is the quantum structure of space. If we understand that, we’ll
understand the mechanism of gravity.  The biggest mathematical
challenge is that, for analogy, whereas General Relativity is an
Initial Value Problem (IVP), formulating Quantum Field Theory in
curved spacetime is like a meta-IVP.  It’s like an IVP wrapping
another IVP, where the mathematic structures to use to resolve the
problem are undeterminable. That’s my intuition speaking.  Resolving
the math is so challenging because the same spacetime curvature can
‘look’ different from each point.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="is-there-a-distinction-between-gravity-and-the-space-it-curves">Is there a distinction between gravity and the space it curves?</h3>

<p>Or is gravity literally the ripple in space? That would imply space is
simpler than it seems. That’s a bummer.</p>

<h3 id="does-gravity-cause-the-path-of-gravitation-itself-to-curve">Does gravity cause the path of gravitation itself to curve?</h3>

<p>This makes sense. If gravitons exist, they should follow similar rules
as photons, right? It’d be weird if most bosons, like photons,
followed the curvature of spacetime, but others didn’t at all.  It’d
make sense if each boson interacted in it’s own way with the curved
nature of spacetime, yet still adhered to the same features of local
space.</p>

<p>And it’d just be weird to have a set of bosons, that interacts via a
completely different kind of space.  Your model would have to account
for multiple models of space: one relativistic and another, who knows.
It’s a lot simpler if all the bosons are in the same space.</p>

<p>In other words, what I’m trying to ask is –</p>

<h3 id="if-gravitons-follow-curved-spacetime-how-does-this-affect-other-bosons">If gravitons follow curved spacetime, how does this affect other bosons?</h3>

<p>And this is the question I got stuck on tonight: If a gravity wave is
moving in the exact same direction as several parallel beams of
photons, how are they affected?  The photons that are moving just
outside of parallel to the gravity wave would certainly be affected
and the more their trajectory is altered, I can say confidently that
the influence of gravity on them would only increase.</p>

<p>However, this would seem to break some kind of directional or spatial
invariance of gravity, relativity or spacetime.  Why is it that the
photon whose trajectory exactly matches a gravity wave not be
affected, while all adjacent photons with the same origin would be
greatly affected?  They would all assume and adhere to a change in
distribution, causing a doppler effect.  Except for this one beam of
photons that wouldn’t be affected at all.  This would be a violation
of continuity in this function.</p>

<h3 id="heres-some-gravitational-lensing">Here’s Some Gravitational Lensing</h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2016-02-08-questions-on-gravity/black-hole-lensing.gif" alt="Black Hole Gravitational Lensing" /></p>

<p>Notice how the objects seem to move away from the black hole as it
first approaches. That is happening because rays that would otherwise
not be directed towards you are following the curved spacetime.
Here’s an image describing how light bends around massive objects.</p>

<h4 id="gravitational-lens-geometry">Gravitational Lens Geometry</h4>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2016-02-08-questions-on-gravity/gravitational-lens-geometry.svg" alt="Gravitational Lens Geometry" /></p>

<p>In the presence of one mass, light will follow a path that only curves
in one direction.  After passing the object, the light will gradually
return to traveling in a straight line, but it only curves towards the
gravitational source.  It doesn’t curve back the other way as it
returns to a straight path.</p>

<h3 id="thought-experiment-traveling-with-a-gravity-wave">Thought experiment: traveling with a gravity wave</h3>

<p>If you imagine a uniformly distributed narrow beam of protons, all
traveling perfectly parallel to each other and traveling in sync with
a gravity wave, you’ll get an idea of how the resulting distorted
distribution of photons would look a bit odd.  Imagine the photons
beginning from various adjacent sources and they are all parallel,
but that the gravity wave was emitted from a single source, so there
are slightly varied angles of incidence to each photon.  Some photons
lie in the crest of the gravity wave and some in the trough.</p>

<p>For the most part, the photons that lie in the crest of the wave get
their trajectory bent slightly inward.  And those that lie on the
trough of the trajectory get bent slightly outward (i think).  So you
can imagine that the resulting distrbution of photons, in this
idealized scenario, would look parabolized.  That is, except for the
beam of photons that is exactly in line with the gravity wave, which
may be technically impossible under real conditions.  This beam,
informed by my current understanding of general relativity and curved
spacetime, could not be slowed down because it’s traveling at the
speed of light and that is constant.  It is taking a straight path
through spacetime that has been curved, but such that the curved
spacetime does not affect it’s apparent trajectory.  And thus, this
beam of light would not be distorted in any way by the gravity, but
would stick out like a sore thumb in the parabolized distribution of
photons.</p>

<p>It’s a violation of continuity because of a problem with
invariance. Unless my understanding of this is incorrect, which is
likely, then this center beam of photons must also be slowed down to
some degree, but I can’t resolve how.  And thus, the photons traveling
in crest of the wave would slow down a bit, apparently.  The photons
traveling in the trough of the wave would speed up a bit, so that
all the photons would be uniformly distorted.</p>

<p>However, this thought experiment has been set up with idealized
conditions, similar to those for general relativity.  In this problem,
the originating mass for the gravity wave is point-like and can
apparently alter its mass with no change in position, producing a
perfectly circular gravity wave, which is impossible in nature. Also,
in nature, it would be impossible to produce a stream of photons that
are exactly in line with the origin of the gravity wave, unless you
could ensure that it was lined up down to the plank length, but I’m
not sure I really understand that.</p>

<h3 id="if-gravitons-alter-the-spacetime-that-other-bosons-operate-on-">If gravitons alter the spacetime that other bosons operate on …</h3>

<p>Then how do you even resolve that dependency graph? One would need
to take precedence over another … or something. In other words,
if none of the bosons alter spacetime, then one can assume that
spacetime is fairly consistent, except for the exception of matter
that moves, but that’s really not that hard to resolve.</p>

<p>All the particles operate on the same space.  If the space changes,
all particles, for the most part, react accordingly and at the same
time.  There are some exceptions maybe with the propagation of
gravity.  Here you can’t really have quantum gravity.</p>

<p>However, if gravitons alter the spacetime that these other bosons are
using, how does one deal with that dependency graph that arises?  If
you view bosons as units in streams of information that modify states
of other particles, then what stream of information do gravitons
make up?  Do they comprise a stream to the surrounding space? How so?
Would that mean space itself is composed of particles too?  Would it
stream information all those spatial particles simultaneously?  That
gets complicated.  How do you deal with deformed space if the plank
length is constant?  Does that mean that space is voxelized?</p>

<h3 id="how-do-scalar-bosons-like-the-higgs-differ-from-gauge-bosons">How do scalar bosons, like the Higgs, differ from Gauge bosons?</h3>

<p>I don’t really know enough to elaborate on this, but there should
be some fundamental differences in how scalar bosons work.</p>

<h3 id="if-energy-is-mass-does-gravitational-energy-interact-with-space-or-mass-in-transit">If energy is mass, does gravitational energy interact with space or mass in transit?</h3>

<p>If gravity travels at the speed of light and force is mass, and if all
matter exhibits gravitational force on all other matter, then what
happens to the gravitational energy between two massive objects moving
away from each other, whose gravitational energy takes significant
time to reach the other object?</p>

<p>Would space curve for the objects in between, because of the
gravitational energy in transit?  If this gravitation energy does
cause space to curve while it’s in transit, does the source of the
gravity affect how space curves? Or is the force expressed on space
simply an aggregate of all the forces being transferred through that
space?</p>

<h3 id="another-thought-experiment">Another Thought Experiment</h3>

<p>Even with the limits of relativity, one can imagine situations where
the gravitational force expressed on two objects could never reach the
other side, AFAIK.  E.G. if large two objects, both traveling toward
each other at half the speed of light, relative to a nearby observer,
then miss each other and continue to travel at nearly half the speed
of light in opposite directions, it could take nearly an eternity
for the force of gravity to exert influence on the other object.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-preserve-conservation-of-energy-with-quantum-gravity">How do we preserve conservation of energy with quantum gravity?</h3>

<p>So, it’s clear that quantum gravity has some complex issues to
resolve.  Otherwise, there are loopholes under which the conservation
of energy would be violated.  This may be an indication that gravity
operates via a non-local mechanism.  Or, in other words, we need more
dimensions to explain it mathematically.  We can be fairly sure that
the force that gravity exhibits travels at the speed of light over
space, but does that mean all of the mechanisms of gravity operate
over our 3-space?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-nature-of-these-other-dimensions">What is the nature of these other dimensions?</h3>

<p>So if gravity operates via mechanisms in other dimensions, how does
the speed of light apply there?  Is there some similar limit?  What is
the structure and nature of these dimensions and why do they not seem
to affect existing observations?  Have we not noticed them before
because the other 3 forces do not interact with these dimensions?  Is
this a kind of compartmentalization that’s required to prevent quantum
gravity from creating dependency issues?  By this, I mean it may be
mathematically simpler if gravity operates on a different space than
the space it manipulates.</p>

<h3 id="the-universe-is-composed-of-streams-of-information">The universe is composed of streams of information</h3>

<p>I found it interesting to think about photons, bosons, etc as streams
of information.  That is, we’re not looking at a star, but we’re
looking at a stream of photons and imagining the star that’s producing
them. And when we look at the night sky, were receiving long, unbroken
streams of photons for each star in the sky.  These streams aren’t
just directly to us, but are more like a radial stream of photons from
the star.</p>

<p>It’s useful to think of other quantum phenomena in the same way i
think.  Yet it’s really hard to imagine gravity as we know it in this
way.  If objects in motion require spacetime to determine their
trajectory, what stream of information could provide the spacetime
with the information needed to distort?  We know that gravity is not
the result of the interaction of two masses, but instead the
interaction of two masses through curved spacetime.</p>

<h3 id="einstein-rings">Einstein Rings</h3>

<p>When the observer is directly in line with a black hole and a large
galaxy further behind it, you can see Einstein Rings.  In this
generated image, as it zooms further in, you can even see that light
from the observer’s region of space is being redirected back towards
the viewer in alternating rings.  For more information, check out the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring#A_simulation">wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<h3 id="is-the-speed-of-light-truly-constant-for-all-conditions">Is the speed of light truly constant for all conditions?</h3>

<p>The main issue I have with all this is that gravity, which
theoritically also travels at c, the speed of light, also effects the
medium through which it flows.  And as I’ve shown above, light is
always slowed down by gravity.  This is because the only value for
which light will not curve is a value that is <em>exactly</em> in line with
gravity’s influence and this is impossible.  Therefore, light will
always be affected in some way and slowed down by gravity.
Technically, the light doesn’t slow down, but it’s flowing through
more “space,” as it’s affected by gravity. And if light is “slowed
down” by a gravity wave, then it would always be slowed down in some
way by the net influence of gravity on space.</p>

<h3 id="is-gravity-really-the-sum-of-effects-on-curved-spacetime">Is gravity really the sum of effects on curved spacetime?</h3>

<p>Which begs the question: are two areas of space functionally
equivalent if they have the same net distortion of space from
any number of gravitational sources?  That is, if you can ensure
that two areas of space have the exact same net component for
gravity, even though that gravity is caused by different sources,
is the effect on masses in that area of space exactly the same.</p>

<p>I’m fairly confident that it’s not.  If there is some structure to
spacetime, than you could not produce two regions with identically
composed spacetime without providing the exact input from masses.
That is, just because you have created a net equivalent of
gravitational forces doesn’t mean that your spacetime is functionally
equivalent in all respects.</p>

<p>Example: you’ve got two planets.  One is huge and the other is small.
You’re in a spaceship in the middle.  Measure the net force of gravity
on your spaceship.  Now, increase the mass of the planets, but move
them further away, so that the net force of gravity is the same. Is
the state of spacetime that your ship occupies identical to it’s
previous state?  No, for a dozen reasons.  And I think getting this to
work to control the state of spacetime would be pretty difficult.</p>

<h3 id="does-gravity-lose-energy-to-dispersion">Does gravity lose energy to dispersion?</h3>

<p>If gravity is also similarly “slowed down” in the same way that light
would be, does that mean that a gravity wave loses energy as it
propagates through space?</p>

<h3 id="if-the-apparent-speed-of-light-varies-from-place-to-place">If the apparent speed of light varies from place to place…</h3>

<p>– and I’m pretty sure this section is shit, but I left it in anyways –</p>

<p>How does this affect how we make observations.  Then the speed of
light itself becomes a kind of initial value problem, where you
can’t pin it down because it’s impossible to measure the net forces
distorting local spacetime.</p>

<p>But then, what is c, really?  If the measurement of this constant
can’t be understood as accurate because it would require measuring the
net distortion of local spacetime, then how does this affect the other
laws of physics?</p>

<p>Like I said, I almost threw this out, but it’s interesting to think
about the dependencies between various laws of physics.  Which are
dependent on c?  Would the be dependent on local or universal c? And
how does this affect the conclusions we’ve reached using statistic
modeling of the cosmos?  And it’s an interesting thought experiment to
examine the dependencies of theories in physics.</p>

<h3 id="does-spacetime-have-memory">Does spacetime have memory?</h3>

<p>If spacetime is distorted by mass, and particularly, if spacetime is
composed of some quantum structure, is this structure permanently
changed by the presence of mass?  Is local space directly connected to
the mass that occupies it?</p>

<h3 id="how-to-extend-the-notion-of-singularity-to-two-or-three-points">How to extend the notion of singularity to two or three points?</h3>

<p>So if a singularity for a black hole is a point so massive it creates
an event horizon from which light cannot escape, are there extensions
for systems with two or three such points?  If you have a binary black
hole system, what happens as the event horizons merge?  Would there be
a singularity that “streched” across space, forming a line? This seems
impossible, but what would the space between these singularities be
like?</p>

<p>
<div>
<img src="/img/posts/2016-02-08-questions-on-gravity/black-hole-merger.gif" alt="Black Hole Merger" />
<aside>Image: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4837860">Urbane Legend</a></aside>
</div>
</p>

<p>And if there was a trinary black hole system that was collapsing, it
seems like an extremely interesting situation could emerge, where a
“triangular” region of space is formed, surrounded by event horizons
linking each singularity.  Learning more about what happens here might
tell us more about the nature of space when a singularity forms, since
prior to that the massive object has volume and will be decomposed
into a singularity in a chain reaction.</p>

<h3 id="dark-matters-incoherent-doppler-shift">Dark Matter’s Incoherent Doppler Shift</h3>

<p>The Ars Technica article discusses unexpected low-energy gamma rays,
whose sources can’t be determined.  It is suspected that extremely
rare interactions with dark matter are triggering these gamma ray
bursts.</p>

<p>The article mentions an interesting inverse correlation in
the doppler shift in dark matter suspected gamma ray bursts (GRB) in
relation to the observed doppler shift from other sources of matter.
Perhaps not an inverse correlation per se, but a lack of coherence
with the doppler shift normally exhibited by normal matter we observe.
Most matter in our galaxy is spiraling inwards towards the center and
moving, on average, at specific speeds in relation to us.  Because of
the difference in speed, we observe the doppler shift and because the
motion of all matter in our galaxy is more or less synchronously
spiraling inwards, we observe a predictable, smooth doppler pattern
for normal matter.</p>

<p>Yet, dark matter doesn’t interact with matter, except through gravity.
The only reason we suspect it exists is because our observations don’t
match our cosmological models.  They mostly match; that is, on a micro
scale, our models for gravity seem to work.  But on the cosmic scale,
there seems to be an enormous amount of missing mass out there than we
can’t account for.  Personally, I’m not so convinced this exists at
all, instead feeling that there’s something subtly wrong with our
models.</p>

<p>This research looked into the doppler shift of the GRB’s, which is
around 3.5 KeV, whereas normal light signal is between 1.5eV and
3.5eV.  Because of the speed difference between the sun and dark
matter, measuring the doppler shift requires sensing very low energy
differences.  But new satellites will be launched with gear that
should be capable of doing this.</p>

<p>This research is significant because we may have observed direct
evidence of dark matter that lines up with our
expectations. Hopefully, the frequency of the GRB’s we see are
spatially coherent with the distortion that our models predict for
dark matter’s effect on mass in each area of our galaxy.</p>

<p>Basically, dark matter’s average motion is distinct from the average
motion of the galaxy and this is what allows us to distinguish the
doppler shift data.  GRB’s shift towards blue when we would expect
normal matter to shift red, which means it’s moving away from the
majority of matter (that we’re moving.</p>

<h3 id="my-thoughts-on-dark-matter">My Thoughts on Dark Matter</h3>

<p>My own uneducated thoughts: I get the feeling that there’s something
subtly off with our model of the universe. We see that there’s some
general variance that’s spatially distributed with the observations
that accompany our data. That is, our observations work in smaller
systems, but on a larger scale, there’s this huge disparity in the
motion we see in galaxies and clusters.  We suspect that dark matter
causes galaxies to cluster and even to form in the first place, but
simply because we can’t explain it otherwise.</p>

<p>But the stars in nearby galaxies?  They seem to cohere to our model’s
predictions, at their interactions with local stars do.  IMO, there’s
something missing from our model of gravity or our understanding of
the structure of space.</p>
