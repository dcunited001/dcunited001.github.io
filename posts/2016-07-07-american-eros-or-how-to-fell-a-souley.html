<h4 id="to-skip-to-the-story-click-herethe-story">To skip to the story, <a href="#the-story">click here</a></h4>

<p>So, this is an excerpted chapter from a book that exists in the
future. This isn’t just any normal book. This is a compendium compiled
by myriad storytellers, forked &amp; spliced to weave together hundreds
of stories, all rooted in a fixed point: the most perfectly visceral
experience of <em>true love</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, this type of literature only exists in the future. It’s an
episaga. It’s creators aren’t authors. They are storytellers. This
eminates from my appreciation of the oral storytelling tradition and a
desire to return to the kind of myth that is more personal, more
human. There is no one single account of such a myth because that
would imply that such a story is perfect and what is less human than
perfection? I hope that authors can embrace the concept of the
episaga.</p>

<p>Though this concept is hardly new, I want to find the architypical
kind of story for it. I want it to be something like the <em>Aristocrat</em>
joke for comedians, where the objective is to take this basic concept
and tell the best story from it. Even the episaga is to be successful
as a concept, there still won’t be very many root stories that gain
significant popularity, since for any project to gain momentum, it
would have to enjoy the support of tons of authors.  Then of course,
there’s the problem of trademark and copyright. What if someone
invests a ton of time on this, to no avail. Fortunately, I’ve found
the perfect answer to this for now: I’ve named my story “American
Eros,” which was published on June 1st, 2013. It’s already a
trademark, so by no means could anyone really make financial gain from
these stories! Boom: problem null and void. Haha, take that, Roko’s
Basilisk…</p>

<h3 id="the-architypical-episaga">The Architypical Episaga</h3>

<p>Anyways, there are a few rules and constraints I want to set for this
particular episaga. The first is a restriction on form: we start by
hearing an account of an event in the future, loosely defined in
concept, time, place, and role. As a reader, we know the story ends
with this chapter. Or maybe, this chapter is a midpoint in some
greater saga. But it’s presented to us at the beginning. Maybe it’s a
romance novel or a sci-fi thriller. Who knows. But, I’ve always found
that some simple, basic limitations envigorate creativity.</p>

<p>The narrator in this section isn’t really me, by the way. Again, I
know how I’m going to develop this character and present the story,
but I’m trying to leave things intentionally open here. And especially
with regard to gender, so feel free to change that around in this
section.</p>

<p>When I actually pitch the episaga to authors, writers and
storytellers, I’ll explain a few more constraints. Some others include
a loose restriction on themes and character archetypes. Another
constraint is explaining the title. I already have some great ideas
for the story I’m going to tell and the themes I’ll cover. It’s mostly
character-driven and there’s not much plot. So, think Jessica Jones,
but with less plot and somebody gets laid … wait, nope, nobody gets
laid.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what platform the project will be hosted on. I’m
thinking Github, but that might be a bit tough for authors, so I’ll
probably pitch it on <a href="https://hitrecord.org">hitRECord</a> as well.</p>

<h2 id="true-love-is-perfectly-visceral">True Love is Perfectly Visceral</h2>

<p>I had a sudden inspiration to write down the perfect love scene. It
came to me on Wednesday. I was wondering why I’ve never had that <em>love
at first</em> sight experience. And then I thought, why should sight be
involved? Could someone fall in love without ever seeing someone?</p>

<p>What would that be like? My head started spinning. Out of all the
senses, my least favorite must be vision. People with vision are much
more superficial. Think about it. If you can’t see, then your
experiences delve quite further below the surface. You wouldn’t
instantly dismiss someone based on their physical appearance, for
example. You wouldn’t visibly react to visual occurances or need to
suppress a conditioned response that indicates superficial thoughts.</p>

<p>Obviously someone who can’t see has challenges in life. But if we
learn to react to more than just our eyes, we would all be better for
it. Vision is such a strong, restrictive sense. Visual images can be
instantly recognized. Computer vision requires intense processing and
so does human vision. I discuss these ideas a bit more in

<h1 id="a-once-in-a-lifetime-experience">A Once in a Lifetime Experience</h1>

<p>This concept from Japan and Zen Buddhism refers to the nature of such
stellar once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-an-age events. But, there’s a
dual truth embedded here, which is so often the case with zen sayings.
The dual notion here is that <em>every experience</em> is a once in a
lifetime experience and we should cherish all moments as having equal,
infinite <em>potential</em> for: astonishment, bewilderment, amusement,
vibrant connection.</p>

<p>However, if you knew that you were in the middle of your
once-in-a-lifetime experince, what would you do? If the goddess of
luck and fortune, Tyche, handed you a blank check, what would you do?
If everything you had ever wanted – or better, yet, everything you
hadn’t been capable of imagining – appeared right in front of you,
could you ride that lightning? So, this first chapter is the summary
of what presents itself in that way to the narrator.</p>

<p>To me, this is a story about life as experienced as a somewhat tangled
lanyard of threads and subthreads. As the mind processes experience
into memory, it marls this rope to emotional or situational
touchstones. Then, it layers down aggregate, self-produced information
on top of those memories, in addition to (and supplanting) the memory
of that sensory experience. These behaviors of the mind are often
noted as what causes witness testimony to change so dramatically,
immediately after an experience.</p>

<h4 id="a-brief-neurological-sidenote">A Brief Neurological Sidenote</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if everything we’ve ever seen exists encoded in
our mind, whether or not those images are linked to consciously
accessible memories? Could we replay someone’s life from an MRI?
Even the suppressed memories? If for some reason it’s possible to
implant memories, the fact this happened will show up as an
abberation in consistency. That is, it is possible to datamine
someone’s MRI images and determine that specific memories were
implanted out of order or they lack links to specific types of
sensory data or sensory data aggregates.</p>

  <p>You need high resolution MRI scans, about 6 Tesla, with and without
dyes. And you need algorithms that combine imagery and statistically
extrapolate information. But it should be able to extract memory
and, if not, then at least detect violations of consistency in
various regions of the brain.</p>

  <p>By the way, <a href="https://github.com/dcunited001/mri-scans">my brain</a> is
on Github. It’s open source. Send me a pull request if you’d like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, what I’m trying to say is that David Foster Wallace was a
genius in the way he wove together various threads &amp; subthreads for
Infinite Jest … even though I’ve only read like 50 pages so far. In
a way, I want to imitate that style with this work. In a way…</p>

<h1 id="american-erosthe-story"><a href="#the-story">American Eros</a></h1>

<h2 id="or-how-to-fell-a-souley">Or How to Fell a Souley</h2>

<p>I never thought I’d have that once in a lifetime experience … but it
happened, so fast, so illustriously fast. It wasn’t love at first
sight. I fell in love the instant I heard her voice, before I turned
to see the angel whose radiance my presence was most certainly
syphoning vitreosity. And brilliance.</p>

<p>It was the unexpected tap on the shoulder. And her voice. It was her
voice. Those words in that instant. It led my heart to awaken. Somehow
the cymatic resonance managed to loosen and disperse the enigmatic
mist masking my own light, between layered neuroses and defense
mechanisms self-applied. Acquired, unconsciously cobbled together to
protect myself from fear of failure and reaching out. My subconscious
so perfectly destroys any chance of relationships from forming with
its own excellent Ninja Warrior obstacle course of self-sabotage.
These are undesired. Most definitely not meant to be understood, if
ever shown to my observer at all. The observer, the one who
witnesses…</p>

<p>Not even my own radiance could pierce those layers of detrimental
self-depricating defense mechanisms. Instead, there’s only a faint
aura, an indication of black-body radiation, coupled with what must
certainly contain blistering heat from contained energy. Ne touchez
pas! No toque las superficies calientes! Daß der Kaffee faktisch heiß
ist! 直火は使用できません！</p>

<p>But I wonder, what would the world see if the self-imposed restraints
marring my heart’s light could be released? What would my observer
see? Could he see himself, as he truly is? Who cares what the world
thinks. That lil guy needs a mirror.</p>

<p>But who is that anyways? Does the same observer follow me around? For
life? World’s worst jobs. What is identity anyways? What is
consciousness? Where does it begin and end? Is there any such barrier
surrounding my own consciousness, separating me from others? Or is the
illusion of separation just that … an illusion? Cyclical references,
I know. I’m a sucker for racing down the hamster wheel of circular
logic. It’s the journey that matters most, right?</p>

<p>Why would you ever want to arrive? Life is about coming and
going. Coming and going. That’s all. But what happens when time
disappears? What does that feel like? Am I feeling that right now?
Suddenly, the sound of a single teardrop, but oddly without
reverb. Did it come from within – my heart skips a beat and a rush of
blood to the head. The dawn sunlight suddenly stops casting shadows
and instead everything is refracted as mother of pearl. The shadows,
the light. A brief, brilliant flash of the essence of beauty itself. I
can’t tell – this perplexing luminance, did it suddenly surge through
the window from the sun? Or maybe this pearling refraction emerged
from within myself. Did she see it too? Was she looking for it?</p>

<p>That rush of blood to the head, just now. Incredulous. What was that?
Was the restraint released from my heart? Impossible. It’s like a
vault. I designed it that way. Or maybe my observer did. Was it him?
Whoever enshrouded it, they built a daedalian labyrynth for a
reason. They gave Icarus wings, but kept him locked in a maze. They
warned him, but knew he’d rise and fall anyways. Or wait, that’s not
right. No that wasn’t Icarus. If he had wings, he’d just fly
out. Whoever it was, if he could just see the maze…</p>

<p>Another heartbeat. No, that can’t be right. What was I doing? Her
voice? Who was it? I didn’t know her. Or did I? My subconscious starts
comparing the imprint in my phonological loop, restreaming it and
transforming it in the auditory cortex, trying to understand: who’s
image is this? Not image, but voiceprint.</p>

<p>My observer is unaware, but my subconsious halts all other background
processes, solely to resolve this one question. Do I know her?</p>

<p>Instantly, my subconscious has accessed the voice prints of everyone I
know or ever passed by. I would not realize it until years later, but
in that brief instant, some part of my mind processed and comprehended
a record of every single person’s voice I’d ever heard. Why? Why was
her voice so different? What could provoke such a surge of
introspection?</p>

<p>And completely missed by my consciousness, my observer. If I’d seen
this girl, even for a second, that self-saboteur would deploy a mental
labyrinth. He’d change everything, distort it, ruin it. <em>Why couldn’t
I just enjoy the beauty of life as it is?</em> Understanding, knowledge,
comprehension… it’s all necessary. It’s vital. But all that
information is baggage. It fogs the lens of our mind’s eye like
trapped condensation, no doubt smearing every single photo we upload
to that great facebook in the sky.</p>

<p>For just a brief moment in time, and perhaps most importantly, it was
our hearts that met first, not our eyes. It transcended space and the
material world. And her brilliance disassembled any masking still
darkening my heart. It’s as if some tendril of her ethereal being
reached through that labyrinth and dispersed its fragments into
spacelessness. Or maybe through sheer elegance, pierced it like a
blade to shadowy gossamer. The connection I felt, it’s as if she saw
through to my heart’s radiance and found something that I myself had
buried and forgotten.</p>

<p>Another heartbeat, but my racing mind had lost count. Faster.
Everything seemed faster. The energy rippled through my veins, my
blood warmed. My mind vanished and I melded into the universe.</p>

<p>There’s a club for those people with perfect relationships who fell in
love at first sight. I’ve never been invited to that club, always
peering in from the outside. So I formed my own club. It’s way
better. I fell in love, without first sight. But when I say I fell in
love, I truly mean that the earth, the stars, they fell around us. The
universe surged with orgasm and gravitational radiation echoed loudly
as the world transfigured itself to spite fate. A nuclear burst of
energy, powered by fate’s chains. No matter what had happened before,
fate lost it’s power for a brief moment. All its intensity to grip and
control life and transfix our destiny. All of that energy suddenly
fed back into itself.</p>

<p>And thus, this is how the universe became philocentric. Love became
the very center of the universe. We became the center of the
universe. Nothing else mattered. The fruit of fortune and fame bloomed
in front of us, green hues shifting to red. Tantalized. Still so
tantalizing. Still so tantalizing. Outpacing the warmth still filling
into my fingers, the perspiration seeping out of my palms. Something
so perfect. Nothing perfect needs anything added or removed. How do I
reach out? How do I take it? My palms are probably glistening with
sweat. What if I can’t hold onto it?</p>

<p>But I felt it. Nothing can confirm your destiny to yourself as
strongly as feeling the foundation of your fate shifting tectonically
beneath your feet. You literally move. You feel it. The ground jumps
beneath you. And this deafening transmogrification of your destiny, it
can’t be denied. And I felt it.  Here. Just now. Every star in the
milky way thrust its mass hopelessly against the chains of fate.</p>

<p>After everything that had just happened to me, there’s no way I could
possibly be both more prepared and less prepared for this moment. Or
for what was about to unfold. I had all but given up quite some time
ago, but everything that happens up until this most perfect moment
exquisitely predisposes us to be so powerlessly susceptible to it. And
yet, at that time, I could not have been more content on my own. Or
… No, not on my own, because I had all these amazing new friends.</p>

<p>There’s no way either of us could comprehend how, but we … we’re
going to change the fate of the world. I have no idea if she remembers
me, especially now, but she reached out that day and changed my life
forever. The bonds on my heart that she so effortly sliced through, it
unlocked something in me. It freed me from the part of myself that
held me back. From what I knew now, I could reach out to others. Maybe
I could free them too. With knowledge. With experience. With love.</p>

<p>If the rest of humanity could feel what I felt in that instant, just
once. They would know. If they could feel the relief, the warmth that
my heart felt, they would be moved. She could tap into my genius, the
ethereal spectra of ancient souls my own spirit was metaphysically
linked to. I knew I had the potential to be great, but my biggest
enemy was myself. I needed someone like that; a better half. Someone
to fill in all the gaps.</p>

<p>And somehow, she knew me better than I did myself. That’s what it felt
like. I asked. Have we met? I racked my mind and countless memories to
find a time we’d cross paths. Was it so familiar because I’d lived
this life countless times before? Is that what happens? Do we live
countless lives simultaneously? Do we live all the variations of our
own life, all at the same time? Do we live everyone else’s life, all
at the same time? Strange thoughts. Why did she seem so familiar?</p>

<p>But there’s no way we could be together. It just wouldn’t work. She
was on such a different path. It was what made me me and what made her
her that drew us together. The only way we could be together is if we
lost that. I realized this and I know she did too. But for those few
days, we loved each other so intensely. Perhaps, it was because we
knew it wouldn’t last. I hope that’s not the secret.</p>

<p>I finally felt like part of the world, instead of an outsider. A
people watcher, looking in. I comprehended all the shades of
chiaroscuro in our social stratifications and gamified human
mechinations. I could comprehend that before, but I can’t say I
understood it. I couldn’t be part of it. Maybe it was because of what
I had learned in the past decade. But she dissolved that separation
between me and the world. Or, I discovered the capacity for love to
dissolve that separation between myself and others. How can I do the
same for others?</p>

<p>And we had talked about just that. I knew it wouldn’t work and because
of this, I wasn’t afraid to tell her how I felt. I told her that I
understood how the universe communicates things like destiny. There
are some things, they are so incidental, yet so impossibly
implausible. I hadn’t seen just a handful of these, there had been
hundreds and it felt like fate was at odds with itself. We were being
pulled together and torn apart all at the same time.</p>

<p>But we both dared dream that, through love, illusion of separation the
world over could be ended.</p>

<h2 id="so-thats-it-for-now">So That’s It! For Now…</h2>

<p>I wrote this section at my usual coffee spot, on July 5th, overcome
with brief inspiration, right before I was about to leave of
course. It was originally just going to be a short creative writing
peice, 2,000 words at most. I was really aiming for a 750 word
description of the effect an experience like this would have on
someone who might not otherwise ever experience something like it.</p>

<p>I almost feel bad writing this down because it’s just so
powerful. It’s a little secret to love that most people would miss,
unless you curl up with romance novels on the reg for a candlelit
rendezvous with both Ben and Jerry…</p>

<h3 id="matchmaker-number-nine">Matchmaker Number Nine</h3>

<p>But, it would be hard for someone to pull this off. If you can or did,
you are officially in the matchmaker’s secret society, the elusive
matchmaker number nine. If you can figure out how to get two magnetic
people to meet and in the most perfect spectacular way, then you wield
powerful magic. But it requires knowing so much about both of them and
knowing exactly how they will first meet. How they would feel on that
day; in the instant just before. On the other hand, people can smell a
stilted scenario a mile away, so the more you do to control and/or add
to the situation, the more you risk ruining it. Any forcing or
grasping might render all your efforts pointless.</p>

<p>It’s the kind of thing that can only be done by observing just the
right qualities in people and their friends and then hoping your
understanding of their personalities will invite a magnanimous
planetery alignment, when they meet. This could be particularly hard
for quiet and/or shy people. To figure out how to bring them
out. Fortunately, there are people who are good at that. Opposites
attract. I’m really just looking for a girl who can straight up
operate my brain like a computer. A better half. Someone who can tap
into my genius and who feels like</p>
