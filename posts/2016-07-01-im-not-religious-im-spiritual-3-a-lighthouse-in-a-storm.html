<p>As we hurtle towards relative omniscience and relative omnipotence,
isn’t it important for us to discuss what makes humanity or any group
worthy of wielding this power? If the primary belief system dictating
policy is atheism and, thus, based on being the absence of any belief
system, how can we ensure that whatever elements are in control of
technology will be reigned in by any set of rules? If we do not have
this discussion now, we will <em>never</em> have the opportunity. We need to
be confident that not only is there an ethical framework, but that it
is beyond insurmountable.  Moreover, we must rest assured that there
is a system of propagating such a framework, so that our children do
not find themselves overwhelmed by forces they can’t understand, while
disconnected from the cultural paths which led there.</p>

<h3 id="mercurial-cultural-deconstruction">Mercurial Cultural Deconstruction</h3>

<p>Elements of our culture will shift beneath us as we stand transfixed
in stuporous awe of the lightning-fast transition of other cultural
elements.  In other words, our attention will be in the wrong place
and we won’t see potential problems until they have saturated the
younger generations.  Each decade of youth will be increasingly
detached from other decades. The cultural spectra that emerge will
continue to diversify and detach until each distinct, detached “color”
in the spectra is but a year or two apart.</p>

<h3 id="cultural-spaghettification">Cultural Spaghettification</h3>

<p>It’s like the spaghettification experienced when falling into a black
hole: the closer you get, the more you get pulled apart, until you get
stretched incredibly thin, like spaghetti.  And such is the effect
that the singularity will have on each age group in our culture, which
is why the singularity might be metaphorically viewed as a
metaphysical black hole. This leads to the <em>Generation Rift</em>
phenomenon, described in
<a href="/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html">The Paradox of Creativity</a>.</p>

<h3 id="generational-stratification">Generational Stratification</h3>

<p>So, religion is a perfect tool for helping to counter this cultural
deconstruction and generational stratification, but it can only be
helpful if large enough sets of people in our culture share belief
systems. In particular, they must share those beliefs which form the
<em>basis</em> of the rest of their beliefs. The notion of a basis was
discussed in the first section of this series.  Where the bases formed
primarily from scientific knowledge are always shifting, those formed
by and tied to religion are much more constant.  In this way, elements
of religion act as <em>metacultural fixpoints</em> in the psyche of
believers.</p>

<h3 id="metacultural-fixpoints">Metacultural Fixpoints</h3>

<p>Without sets of archetypical fixpoints shared across large groups of
our society, without regard to class or ethnicity, we are going to
quickly find ourselves lost in the future. The basis for belief
systems formed by science is completely detached from anything
permenant. Like Ouroboros, it is always cyclicly consuming itself:
newer beliefs in the basis supercede older beliefs and the resulting
belief structure representing science’s extrapolated sphere of
knowledge is constantly recalculated and constantly redistributed.
While this process continues to accelerate, then the costs to cultural
stability will increase just as steadily. So we need these fixpoints
to ground our culture in something.</p>

<h3 id="differential-singularity">Differential Singularity</h3>

<p>We risk ending up dealing with a phenomenon I refer to as differential
singularity. This draws on the differential created in belief systems
as new discoveries in science are propagated outward to policy makers
and everyone else. In part one, I argued that there is significant
opportunity to abuse the differential and time delay here to profit
financially and politically.  However, as progress towards the
singularity increases this differential only grows wider.  We risk
creating a situation where the people currently in control of the
technology seal themselves off from threats to their power.</p>

<p>At some point, unless access to information is permitted, there is a
huge opportunity for the power-hungry to abuse this differential.
There are specific technologies which magnify the rate at which new
discoveries occur: this is the nature of the singularity.  On the
other hand, many of these technologies are incredibly dangerous and,
thus, the desire to wall these techs off is justified.  It is because
of this that the likelihood is all the more probably that a small
faction of people would abuse the differential singularity. If they
did, they could justify it to those around them while keeping it
secret from most of us.</p>

<h3 id="im-still-searching">I’m Still Searching</h3>

<p>While I claim that religion is needed because of it’s capacity to
shape the minds of the next generation, I haven’t provided or accepted
such a vehicle myself.  I don’t believe humanism is quite capable in
this regard and I feel like atheism completely disregards the value of
such a vehicle and our need for one.  However, I don’t intend on
specifying how such a thing should be constructed for my own belief
system, since it is mine and mine alone.</p>

<p>To clarify, I am not trying to specify the “correct” religion or the
correct set of beliefs that should form the basis of a religion. I
don’t want to even even specify that there could be such a “correct”
set of beliefs. This is because I don’t believe it is possible for me
or anyone else to fully comprehend the entity which represents my
definition of God – of which we may construct a reflection of this
entity, but only an imitation of the real thing. And I also don’t
believe it’s possible for anyone to state that their set of beliefs is
the superior belief system. I do not intend to force my opinions and
beliefs on others. Please understand my motivation behind writing
this is sincere concern that we may find ourselves unprepared for the
future, regardless of which class, ethnicity or religion we are part
of.</p>

<p>Just wanted to summarize over those, although that list is by no means
complete. And please let me emphasize: I in no way intend or intended
to create something that other people would follow. Dear God, no. That
would be irresponsible. I simply wanted to understand as much about
the world as I could, including world religions, though I’m
embarrassed to say I’m a complete novice.</p>

<p>And I’m ashamed to associate with any religion at this point,
honestly. I couldn’t hope to touch something pure without getting it
dirty, whether it’s Buddhism or Christianity or whatever. And while I
clearly see the value of religion yet hold it’s waning influence
partially responsible for many of the problems we have in the world
today, I find it difficult to defend the need for such a vehicle since
I haven’t strongly embraced any religion. I can’t exactly use my
interpretation of bible verses as rhetorical defense because who am I
to interpret something like that, if I don’t claim strong personal
belief.</p>

<p><a name="the-golden-rule"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-the-golden-rulethe-golden-rule"><a href="#the-golden-rule">ↂ The Golden Rule</a></h2>

<p>We should act as though we are all one and that to harm another is to
harm oneself. IMO, the Ten Commandments and Noahide laws are rules that
someone who truly respects another would not break.  Not because they
are clearly stated rules, but because someone who equinanimously
informs their action with empathy and awareness just wouldn’t break
those rules.  Such a person’s ethical rules for action might not
map up one-to-one with the Ten Commandments, but still, their actions
will mostly line up with them.</p>

<p><a name="we-are-all-one"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-we-are-all-onewe-are-all-one"><a href="#we-are-all-one">ↂ We Are All One</a></h2>

<p>If we truly are all one, then harming another person is equivalent to
harming oneself.  This is why I try to extend the Golden Rule to
perceiving situations and interactions as though I am literally the
other person or people involved.  I will try to see the world through
their eyes. This and the Golden Rule are the most important aspects –
and I’m not sure that these are two separate things.  Almost
everything else could be dropped or redefined.</p>

<p>From here, one must decide on relative or absolute morality: either
moral relativism or the moral universalism of Kant.  This requires
universalizability, which dictates that, for an action to be
permissable, it must apply equally to every situation and every
person.  It is nearly impossible, but incredibly admirable to adhere
to Kant’s philosophy, as it almost entirely nullifies your space of
potential actions and makes you more predictable.</p>

<p>Also, it is incredibly hard to practice empathetic behavior if people
warp the perception of you, rendering you a pariah. It’s not an excuse
to limit one’s interactions with others or restrict empathy, but it is
really hard to practice compassion or provide value to others when one
has no income and practically nothing to give.</p>

<p>Furthermore it’s incredibly hard to see the world through someone’s
eyes when they see you as a miserable useless piece of shit and they
never intend on allowing others to see you in an honest light.  Why
would I want to view their perspective, when all they intend is to
limit me, no matter what I do?  Of course, it is still crucial to try
because you can only connect with someone by empathizing with them.</p>

<p><a name="negative-neutral-positive"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-negative-neutral--positivenegative-neutral-positive"><a href="#negative-neutral-positive">ↂ Negative, Neutral &amp; Positive</a></h2>

<p>Obviously, I miss the mark on compassion and the Golden Rule quite
often. It is one thing to do no harm and seek neutrality with the
world. For the most part, this is easy for me. But it is another thing
entirely to contribute to the world around you. Just because you don’t
harm another doesn’t mean you’re actively giving back.  If you don’t
expend time, energy, and resources contributing positively to the
people around you, you’ll find yourself pretty isolated.  If someone
seeks to strip you of your resources to rob you of your capability to
positively influence people around you, this is incredibly depressing.</p>

<p><a name="the-unknown"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-the-unknownthe-unknown"><a href="#the-unknown">ↂ The Unknown</a></h2>

<p>There is this mystical, ineffable force that pervades every fragment
of the universe. It is powerful and we cannot ever hope to fully
understand it, but it’s far from fruitless to try. This is the basis
for the connection between all of us, our karma, and the direction of
our individual fates. I explain this a little better in this article
on the <a href="/posts/2016-05-31-the-nature-of-god.html">Nature of God</a>,
although the language is a bit dense.</p>

<p><a name="the-intangible"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-the-intangiblethe-intangible"><a href="#the-intangible">ↂ The Intangible</a></h2>

<p>The intangible is as real as the tangible. The beliefs of others are
as real as the chair I’m sitting in. The intangible extends to
metaphysical concepts beyond those based on information processed by
conscious, physical beings. There is consciousness everywhere;
everything is connected. And there are intangible metaphysical
artifacts pervading space and time. They might be metaphysical and
thus, invisible and intangible, but the effects on our lives are very
real.</p>

<p>Some of these will never change – and it could be argued that any
which are not perminant can be summarily &amp; totally defined in terms of
those that are permanent. Math is such a universal, metaphysical
object, which cannot ever change by its nature and from which all
other things can be defined.  Therefore, these objects that cannot be
changed are timeless. Our inescapable fates are defined in terms of
the intangible and nothing can escape it’s reach.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many scientists, despite their intelligence or intent
to search for truth, completely disregard the metaphysical, as their
model of reality begins in the material. They view humanity as
basically wetware with neurotransmitters marking state in chemical
software writtin in a genetic programming language.</p>

<p>In addition to the Golden Rule, we need to think outside our current
time and place.  This means considering how people lived in the past,
as well as how they could live in the future. We should think of our
possible future selves as already existing and act accordingly.
Sometimes it’s better imagine situations through the lense of our
idealized selves than from within the confines of our present
situation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I were already the person I wanted to be, how would I handle this
situation differently? That person that built my dreams, what would
he or she have done to get there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Romans had their own concept of genius, which was like the divine
essence that lay beyond our psyche: it was like our individual star in
the metaphysical sky. It resembles this concept of the idealized
self. When we are young, we should develop that kernel of knowledge
that allows us to best decide what we want to do with our lives and
helps us identify the pieces of knowledge which are most useful. It
helps if our parents can be very involved in our lives or that we at
least have some mentor who can fuel this development.  Our minds are
most pliable then and we have the most opportunity for the most
growth. Yet, it is unfortunate our time spent at the height of our
potential is precisely when we have a minimal understanding of the
world, preventing us from best planning how to invest that potential.</p>

<p><a name="timelessness"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-timelessnesstimelessness"><a href="#timelessness">ↂ Timelessness</a></h2>

<p>I find it an invaluable tool to simulate ancient models of thought. It
helps to brainstorm other ways of viewing the world or of trying to
reach the same idea. I will think hard about problems without cheating
with today’s knowledge or technology. For example, simulating Arabian
mathematicians’ understanding algorithms when they originally
developed the concept. Or trying to think through whether or not the
ancient Greeks would have been able to predict this or that. If so,
how would they have been able to predict these conclusions. It’s a
useful tool, but can easily lead to unfounded inferences, so it’s
important to keep that in mind.</p>

<p>So, for example, it would be possible for people to foresee that
overpopulation was the inevitable result of population growth, given
two things: exponential growth and the spherical, and thus limited,
shape of the earth. In fact, ancient people were all too familiar with
constraints on their life imposed by local overpopulation and the
effects it had on society.  Their urban development was limited to
buildings a few stories tall and their lack of technology meant that
food production was limited.</p>

<p>Further still, they may have been able to at least imagine how things
would unfold in future events by specifying what those limitations
were that inhibited their growth: human/time/energy cost of food
production, transportation, communication, disease and the
like. Simply by enumerating these, then assuming that technology would
resolve them, and then iterating through scenarios derived from
combinations of sets where specific limitations were removed, they
could foresee social changes and events to unfold at some point in the
future. Or they could at least try. For example, if you assumed that
the time required for communication drops to zero or that the
bandwidth approaches infinite, you could surmise how that may change
society. If you assume disease could be controlled, then you might
surmise a large city with a democracy like Athens might thrive beyond
a specific population growth instead of becoming doomed by
epidemic. Understanding that cities hosting more than a maximal
population size, determined by the likelihood of catastrophe, would
change the nature of long-term geopolitical influences: people would
lose interest in rural life and power structures in cities would
become more powerful and efficiently constructed.</p>

<p>Yet, there are many things complicated by our way of life.  In many
ways, ancient people could foresee much more accurately than we can
comprehend. We don’t have enough time to think the same thoughts. The
space of possible thoughts has so profoundly expanded and our minds
are occupied with consideration of trivial, non-universal knowledge,
whereas the scope of concepts that would occupy the ancient mind are
narrow and more likely to be universal. in so many instances, we
assume that we already have the answers and never bother to think
through these questions ourselves. The sturdy foundations of Western
and Eastern philosophy are a blessing and a curse, as all these great
debates and discussions have been resolved. We can learn about it, but
most of us never have any a postieri development of ideas which are
structured independently of those foundations. I think there is
tremendous value in developing our own thoughts. Yet, because it’s so
difficult to do so once we’re exposed to superior means of framing
philosophical questions, we never have that chance.</p>

<p>And we perceive these ancient people to be ignorant because they
lacked technology when actually our way of life almost completely
clouds our vision and our minds.  We deal with so much irrelevant
information and non-sense. Our lives are structured so that we cannot
see beyond our blinders. In some cases, it is impossible to reach many
of the same insights that ancient people might consider common sense.</p>

<p>This is one perspective I entertained when examining Buddhist
eschatology dealing with Maitreya.  Maitreya will appear in the future
when most people are disconnected with the dharma and he will achieve
enlightenment. After a certain point, people will lead incredibly long
lives and they will completely lose the ability to become enlightened
for a very long time. I want to refrain from making too many
conclusions about this, but to me, this means we are disconnected from
enlightenment because of some aspect of our culture or lives at that
time. Or, at least, that our ability to reach true enlightenment or
something like it can be significantly impaired by our way of life.</p>

<p><a name="emphasizing-potential"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-emphasizing-potentialemphasizing-potential"><a href="#emphasizing-potential">ↂ Emphasizing Potential</a></h2>

<p>I believe that we interact best with others when we see them for their
potential, instead of their faults. We shouldn’t limit another’s
capacity in our mind, through judgement or however. Too often we
develop some rigid preconcieved notion of how someone “is” and we
forget to think of them in terms of how they could be.</p>

<p>This has happened to every one of us: someone sets their expectation
of us and they treat us like that and we fall in line exactly with
their expectations. Example: someone is treated like they might be a
thief, they’re hurt by the assumption and so, in response, they steal
something. The example’s a bit extreme. Another common example
surrounds mental illness: someone is labelled as depressed or bipolar
or schizophrenic or quick to anger. And the reinforcement of the label
itself is responsible for reinforcing behaviors which contribute to
the label.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you find yourself in these kinds of situation, you
shouldn’t give in and allow other people to define what you are.  That
is weak, but it is all too easy to give in. The harder people try to
label you, the louder and more vocal they are, and the more uniform
their assertions, the easier it becomes to give in.</p>

<p>Too often, I have allowed my silence and inaction to lead me to
becoming defined by others, and honestly, I am so tired of that.  Do
not try to label me or define me or tell me what I believe or explain
to others what I think. I define myself. I have my own beliefs. I
think my own thoughts. And no one should assume they have the right to
ANY of that.</p>

<p>I have sacrificed so much in order to never give in, in order to
openly support controversial causes like drug legalization. I will be
damned if I let someone else define me or speak for me. I have been
victimized in the workplace by a handful of people and I just sat idly
by, not wanting to say anything wrong or worried that I’d sink to
their level. And I just sat there, while they made my life miserable;
they ruined my life and I just sat there!  They obliterated any
confidence anyone had in me at my workplace and they did so in a
calculated, strategic manner.</p>

<p>And so my point is: do not find yourself in this position.  Define
yourself. Speak up. Be independent. Think your own thoughts. Listen to
others and especially to understand how they see you.</p>

<p>Conversely and by corrolary, make it easier for others to define
themselves, authentically.  You can do this by providing better
information to them about how you perceive them. It may not be tactful
to do in a direct manner and it may be more effective to do this
indirectly. You can give them the space and autonomy to grow. You can
share anecdotes and experience that might end up being important to
how they see themselves or what they decide to do with their career.</p>

<p>Always be aware of the lens you’re using to view them: is this a
perspective you’ve constructed independently? Is it honest? Is it
helpful? If this person needs change, do they want to change? Is that
desire to change just verbal or is it conscious? Or does it appear
that the desire for change motives a few actions or does it permeate
their thoughts and actions? It’s important to be realistic and keep
your goals in mind.</p>

<p>There was a Rick and Morty episode about this concept of envisioning
someone in terms of their potential instead of their flaws. To
summarize, Beth and Jerry go to couples therapy and end up fighting
the way they envision each other, materialized as monsters. I won’t
really spoil how everything works out, but it’s worth watching. It’s
episode 7 of the 2nd season: Big Trouble in Little Sanchez.</p>

<p><a name="help-others-grow"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-help-others-growhelp-others-grow"><a href="#help-others-grow">ↂ Help Others Grow</a></h2>

<p>It’s important to give back and help those around you develop skills
and opportunity. There have been quite a few situations where I’ve
seen those in a position of relative power attempt to prevent those
around them from fully developing. It is usually to prevent that
person from pursuing greener pastures or from becoming more valuable
to that organization or whatever. Rule #1 is <em>Never Outshine the
Master</em>, after all. That’s the first rule!</p>

<p>It’s vital to be humble and patient towards those you’re serving. But
in my experience, I remember those people who contributed to my
skills, career, personal life or hobbies, especially when it seemed to
run counter to their incentives. Teaching others and being a mentor
are invaluable means to enrich your self, your organization and your
community. In a very profound way. This is one of the best ways to
develop your social network. If you have a positive influence on
someone, especially if it took significant energy over a long period
of time, then you will develop a strong connection. That person is
probably going to represent you in a positive way.</p>

<p>And if, for whatever reason, someone limits your ability or
opportunity for teaching others, then imagine how much that would
limit you in life! One of my greatest mistakes when trying to organize
a jamskating team when I was about 18 was my failure to realize just
how useful and rewarding it would to help other people grow. I lost so
many opportunities for growth, resulting from partly my own failure to
recognize this, paired with the fact that many of the people around me
wanted me to ultimately fail. A decade later, I found myself asking
“Why the fuck did they not suggest X or advise me about Y?” The reason
is because a few people around me didn’t actually want me to succeed,
but they also did not want to appear to interfere. Why? Drug
legalization. It was because I supported legalization and other
controversial causes.</p>

<p>Actively or passively preventing someone from giving back to others
and being a positive influence in their life is the equivalent to
topping a tree. Their social network will be so stunted later in their
life and they probably won’t know what happened. Again, there’s much I
could have done and it’s hard to argue that this was intentional.
Maybe they were justified. Maybe they never thought to do that and
it’s just a coincidence that my people stabbed me in the back more
times than I can count.</p>

<p><a name="light-dark-good-evil"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-light--dark-good--evillight-dark-good-evil"><a href="#light-dark-good-evil">ↂ Light &amp; Dark, Good &amp; Evil</a></h2>

<p>These two concepts can each be viewed on a separate axis. Light and
Dark describe the degree to which something can be seen. Good and Evil
describe something like the morality of an action, event, person, or
piece of information. So darkness can enshroud evil actions or intent,
preventing actions from countering it, but it can equally protect
good. If some force for good can’t be seen, then retains a bit of
unpredictability. Someone might “throw shade” on something or someone
to prevent it from being seen by others. This can cripple you if
you’re suffering but no one realizes it because you’ve had your social
connections severed.</p>

<p>When you cast light on something, it makes it more apparent to
others. I’ve been serendipitously saved so many times by simply making
the right pieces of information seen. There are certain circumstances
you can avoid, just by making something known. There was very bad
experience I had in Denver, where I briefly moved in with someone who
was mentally ill. I didn’t know him very well at all and I only lived
with him for 2 days before leaving. This was the most frightening
experience in my life because I already felt threatened, but I
suddenly realized that I had no friends or family who really knew
where I was. What scared me most of all was the degree to which this
guy would try to distract me when I pulled my phone out, especially
when I mentioned calling my family.</p>

<p><a name="awareness-of-evil"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-awareness-of-evilawareness-of-evil"><a href="#awareness-of-evil">ↂ Awareness of Evil</a></h2>

<p>There are types of events which are much more difficult for someone to
pull off if they know other people are aware of your situation or of
certain facts. And you’ll find that manipulative or abusive people
will try to threaten you into not making information known. And
perpetrators of specific crimes, especially experienced repeat
offenders will try to ascertain specific peices of information to
gauge the likelihood of success or problems. If you provide them
specific answers that indicate vulnerability, they might take action.</p>

<p>If they’re clever, they won’t indicate or alarm you when they’re
searching for this information. <em>THIS ITSELF IS THE BIGGEST RED FLAG.</em>
It is a huge indication that something is wrong when you ascertain
that someone is trying to read pieces of information from you that
indicate vulnerability to a specific type of crime or exploit. The
degree to which they hide their intent implies their skill and
foresight, as well as the degree to which you should fear that
situation. Good memory is important here because if someone rearranges
the order in which they attempt to acquire information, it obscures
cause and effect and becomes harder to detect that someone is going to
pull one over on you.</p>

<p>In order to recognize these situations, you have to become aware of
the kinds of crimes or ethical omissions that people might want to
commit. You need to know what would motivate someone towards that end
or in what ways someone could be compelled to commit a crime.
Understanding the process, time and materials required for such
actions is also important in determining what information someone
requires. The more time they have, the more they can obfuscate their
actions to avoid detection.  The more resources they have, the more
likely they can involve other people, meaning that now, you not only
have to worry about the information you’ve given to one person, but
the information that you’ve given to several people and you need to
know how they’re connected. If you’re up against a well lubricated
machine that facilitates undercover activity, then the connections
will be difficult to perceive.  If you’re fighting a surveillance
apparatus, then you may need to be aware that they have information
you never disclosed to anyone.  If someone has information that you
have never disclosed to anyone or they have information that you only
ever disclosed to one person, that’s a red flag.</p>

<h2 id="x2182-everything-has-a-purposeeverything-has-a-purpose"><a href="#everything-has-a-purpose">ↂ Everything Has a Purpose</a></h2>

<p>It’s a bit interesting that knowledge of evil is required to fight
against it. If for some reason, evil disappeared, then we would be
totally inept against it in just a few generations. So, yes,
everything has a purpose. There is a reason for everything. If you’re
a Christian, this can help answer the problem of evil: why would God
create evil or allow it to exist? Yet, it doesn’t completely resolve
the problem of evil.</p>

<p>Again, everything has a purpose. Instead of immediately disdaining
manisfestations of negativity, you can reorient your perspective by
reminding yourself that there is a purpose and reason for everything.
If you get fired, maybe you belong in another company or industry or
career path.</p>

<p>My personal favorite? When you can predict someone’s sequence of
actions under various circumstances, you understand that they might
fulfill a particular purpose. It can be a bit screwed up to think of
people in this way.  It’s another reason why, even though one might
cultivates a great understanding of the secret motion of things and a
great awareness of the state of the world, one should not interfere.
The subtlest of actions can have extraordinary consequences.</p>

<p><a name="relative-and-absolute"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-relative--absoluterelative-and-absolute"><a href="#relative-and-absolute">ↂ Relative &amp; Absolute</a></h2>

<p>The relative and absolute can be applied to morality, but can also be
generalized to almost anything.  Moreover, there is a continuum
between the two and neither can be completely reached.  It’s best to
attune your actions to both, when possible.  It should always be
possible, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Intelligence and creativity
help immensely.</p>

<p>Cohering to the relevant means you consider your relationship to your
local surroundings first, whether or not that means local in the
physical sense. Cohering to the absolute means adhering to a set of
ideas that don’t change under circumstance. For morality, this means
Kant’s moral universalism.</p>

<p><a name="the-empty-mind"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-the-empty-mindthe-empty-mind"><a href="#the-empty-mind">ↂ The Empty Mind</a></h2>

<p>It’s peculiar, how an empty mind is so much more capable of
functioning than the conditioned mind. As tabula rasa, the empty mind
has the capacity for anything and yet is nothing. In itself it is not
very useful. Still, unlearning bad habits and untangling negative
beliefs and is incredibly challenging. So it’s best to learn things
right. As you develop further, if you actively observe beginner’s
mind, you can use your awareness of it to partially apply it’s
benefits as you need them.</p>

<p>It’s terrible to reinforce an anxiety you have about something, like a
type of situation or a personal behavior. It’s best not to get hung up
on this stuff because it can inhibit the rest of your mind and
anxieties are self-perpetuating by nature. Some anxieties are
basically your mind overexerting itself on minor details. This can be
emotionally exhausting, but it can also deplete nutrients and the
chemical energy your brain needs to function. Just like a computer
with malware, a mind infested with negativity or one that constantly
reacts to situations with negative thoughts wastes it’s resources and
runs slower. If this gets bad enough, it can lead to a runaway effect
and
<a href="http://www.biologicalpsychiatrycnni.org/article/S2451-9022(16)00062-8/fulltext">connectopathy</a>
can manifest as mental illness, like schizophrenia or schizoid
personality disorder.</p>

<p>If you find yourself with thoughts like this, meditative activities
can be a boon for untangling the negativity in your mind.  A mind that
is calm and focused on just the right aspects of a situation works
best.</p>

<p>But how do you know how to embrace the emptiness of your mind if
knowing to appreciate an empty mind requires at least that knowledge
itself? What is the bare set of knowledge that one must have to
appreciate nothingness? Or to appreciate life? What set of knowledge
is necessary to most effectively utilize one’s own mind? If we can
harness beginner’s mind, how do we tap into that after we become an
expert in some skill? Wouldn’t that require cultivating awareness of
our present moment to observe our state of mind as we experience life?
And if we are observing our own mind, then which part of our mind are
we observing? If we must focus part of our mind to observe the
machinations of the rest of our mind, then what does that imply about
the structure of our mind? And how do we observe it in totality?</p>

<p>Perhaps, the answer is … . .</p>

<h2 id="x2182-willpower--self-masterywillpower-and-self-mastery"><a href="#willpower-and-self-mastery">ↂ Willpower &amp; Self-Mastery</a></h2>

<p>We must comprehend what motivates others and what motivates
ourselves. When we develop awareness of the long-term goals of others,
we can see how they might fit into our life and we can draw on our own
network to help them. When we ascertain their short-term motivations,
we can more effectively predict their actions. When we develop a model
for their behavior and their propensity to stick to a goal or follow
short-term desire, we gain a much better understanding of their
character.</p>

<p>True self-mastery is the ability to want to do the things you don’t
want to have to do. In other words, to trick your mind into enjoying
experiences which are otherwise unpleasant by abstracting yourself
from the more base cognitive patterns that arise from negative or
unwanted experiences, when it’s something that contributes to a
goal. Aristotle wrote about this in Ethics.</p>

<p>The brain and mind are peculiar. They are kind of like biological
computers, but I don’t believe we are just chemical robots trapped in
meatspace. Yet because our minds are computers, they operate using
programs, though the API isn’t quite as direct as Twitter’s. The
interface here is far more complicated.</p>

<p>Programs in the human mind are more like convolutions on memory,
experience and behavior, combined with short and long-term
optimization for goals. These include conscious, subconscious and
completely unconscious desires or objectives. Behind nearly every
person’s behavior is a motivational force seeking some kind of
equilibrium with those goals and desires.  For some of us, we have
become well aware of what we want out of life, but many of us succumb
to hedonistic desires. For a few of us, those desires are constantly
in flux, based on our current emotional state and recent sensory
experience.</p>

<p>Everyone wants something in life. It’s very rare to find individuals
who don’t want much of anything. Almost every time, inability to
manage one’s desires is a bad thing and leads to tumultuous
behavior. The exception is the hermit or the devout religious
adherent: they don’t desire much or have a limited, rigorously
justified set of desires. Everyone else?  They want something from
life. And you’ll find, the more they want it, the harder they’re going
to work to get it.  And if more people want some specific thing, the
more competition there’s going to be for it.  In almost every industry
or hobby, if you get close to the top, people are different.  They try
harder and some play dirty. But the trick to winning, every time, is
maintaining your own desire for your goals and your dreams. You have
to want it more. And you have to develop a strong motivation to do
what you need to do, but especially to do what you don’t want to do.</p>

<p>The people that work hardest and work smartest will win. The people
who want it most will keep striving to work harder and smarter. You
can’t crush the human spirit.</p>

<p>It follows that one of the most effective tactics you’ll find used
against you is to distract you from your goals. Or to convince you
that you want something else. This is one reason you have to decide
what you want. What’s your passion? What matters to you? When you know
this, you can fight for it and you can do so without distraction or
demoralization.</p>

<p>If you don’t, people will play you against your ambivalence. You’ll
find yourself as the starving donkey stuck between two bales of hay,
always headed to a new goal, but never quite getting there. It’s
better not to have a particular tendency for a desire than to have
developed a fortitude against that tendency. However, that willpower
and fortitude to resist desire generally is indispensible. And
generally, because those things we need to do, but don’t want to do
are so important to anyone’s long-term success in life, then
developing a strong capacity here is one of the most important
attributes you can develop.</p>

<p>The importance of understanding our own mind’s inner workings cannot
be understated. For example, the analytical mind and the emotional
mind tend to inhibit each other, at a neurological level. This means
that activating the analytical circuits – for periods of time
exceeding, say, thirty minutes – will cause your brain to shift the
allocation of energy and resources towards those analytical circuits.
It has been shown that this will cause the emotional functions of your
mind to be diminished to some degree. If you want to understand this
more, I would suggest taking a detailed look at neurological research
yourself.</p>

<h4 id="fmri-reveals-reciprocal-inhibition-between-social-and-physical-cognitive-domainshttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc3602121"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3602121/">fMRI reveals reciprocal inhibition between social and physical cognitive domains</a></h4>

<p>This paper discusses two different neural components used in our
personal and professional lives: the <em>Task Positive Network</em> and the
<em>Social Network</em>.  The Task Positive network is activated when given
some analytic tasks, like programming, financial number crunching,
math or physics. It’s part of our executive function. When it’s
activated, it suppresses other aspects of our mind.</p>

<p>In particular, its activation suppresses the Social Network, which is
a component of the <em>Default Mode Network</em>. The Social Network helps
you deal with social &amp; emotional issues. Recent studies have shown
that the TPN and the SN are almost completely independent and have
very little neural overlap. Again, it has been demonstrated that they
suppress each other.  So if you’re focused on analytical tasks, then
you are less proficient at processing social and emotional issues,
until you switch gears.  Further still, I hypothesize switching gears
itself likely is inefficient for your brain to do. And so, when you
have someone at your workplace who doesn’t have to focus analytically
(or effectively doesn’t!) and they spread toxic social/emotional
issues, then how do you think that contributes to the overall
functioning of your teams?</p>

<p>And perhaps just targeting one person, who isn’t very good at
social/emotional issues in the first place – I.E. <em>ME</em> – then guess
who’s going to be struggling to perform their job <em>AND</em> suffer the
most, emotionally? If the toxic employee is trained in psychology and
compels the other employee to constantly switch from focusing on
analytical issues to emotional issues, do you think they will appear
to get much done? NO!  It will burn out their brain with stress. And I
mean it will literally chemically burn out their brain. As in,
lasting, permanent, chemical and neurological damage. In particular,
stress damages the hippocampus.  Enough of this – I.E. 5+ years –
and that person might find it hard to function again, ever!</p>

<p>Worse still, how do you think that compelling little stazis to
psychologically torment people on a government list would affect the
economy, on a local, regional and national level? Do you think that
would benefit a struggling economy or would it be detrimental? How do
you think such regulation would affect small business? …. What
happens when small business struggles on a national scale?  Isn’t
small business crucial for the middle class? Isn’t the middle class
vital for the prosperity of common Americans? If you support something
like this, <em>THEN WHO AND WHAT DO YOU STAND FOR?</em> If not the American
economy, <em>THEN WHO OR WHAT DO YOU REPRESENT?</em></p>

<p>Resources like nutrition, ATP for energy, and preproduced protein
products are localized throughout the brain. Overexertion of specific
brain circuits will exhaust those resources. This may be partially
responsible for the effect where you can spend hours and hours on a
problem and make no progress, but take a short break or relax with
friends and suddenly you have a burst of creativy insight because
you’ve given those neural circuits a chance to replentish their
resources.  If we understand the causes behind effects like these, we
can engage the peculiarities of our mind for our benefit.</p>

<p>Another incredibly important aspect to mental functioning is blood
flow. This is why exercise is so important. Cardio increases your
heart rate and blood cycles resources in and waste out. Some of the
deeper tissue subnetworks in your organs and brain are difficult to
reach unless your body cycles blood faster. This is because those
deeper tissue subnetworks are only accessible via capillaries and I
surmise that there is a large disparity in the resource distribution
at the capillary level. Therefore, increasing your heartrate through
healthy, daily exercise is necessary to happiness and bodily function
and mental acuity. It doesn’t matter how healthy you eat if your body
has trouble distributing those resources!</p>

<p>There are both negative and positive ways that we can use psychology
and neurology. We should familiarize ourselves with the negatives to
defend ourselves against it and hope that it isn’t misused. We should
practice using the positive patterns of behavior that we can learn

<p>Case in point: this study, where it’s show that the <em>Hemodynamic
Network</em> and the <em>Mirror Neuron Networks</em> complement each other to
augment empathy.  The HN tunes us into another’s emotions at a neural
level.  This relates more to perceiving their emotional state, then
the kind of simulation done by MNN, which support empathy by
“mirroring” via a kind of simulation of another’s experience based on
what you know.  That is, MNN can consciously or subconsciously allow
someone to simulation themselves in another’s shoes based on the
models of behavior, circumstance and life that they understand.</p>

<p>Simulation via MNN is great, but it leaves a few gaps, primarily
caused by cognitive bias.  If we haven’t experienced enough of life to
accurately understand someone else, we might miss a few details when
we try to put ourselves in their shoes.  So we may be a bit blindsided
when they’re angry or distraught in a situation, when we simulated via
MNN that they would be happy or content. In this case, the HN lets us
observe their externalized expression of their feelings. If we get a
mismatch here, then this should indicate that we need to step back and
observe the situation from another angle. That is, the Hemodynamic
Network contrasts the feedback we receive from the Mirror Neuron
Networks and this should invite us to investigate why.</p>

<p>We are best when we have as much power over our fate and circumstance

<p>There’s a plethora of reasons to back up this wisdom. But it’s in your

affecting. We’re always affecting other people’s lives. It is
impossible to escape this. It’s like carrying a large bucket filled
with water just over the brim and making it down a mountain without
spilling a single drop. It it is incredibly difficult to avoid
interfering with causality in another person’s life.</p>

<p>But they’ll learn more from it. They’ll grow more from it. And, with

minimizing interference with causality. So it’s best for us to give
without being seen giving and those who do should be rewarded.</p>

<p>We should know ourselves and our world. We can’t know ourselves
without learning about the world and we can’t fully understand the
world without knowing about ourselves. Self-knowledge is fundamental
to understanding the world. In mathematics and particularly group and
ring theory, the existance of an identity value is essential.  In
life, self-knowledge fulfills the same purpose.  If everything can be
defined in terms of it’s relationships to everything else, then
learning about ourselves is one of the best ways of learning about the
world.  And apropos that, to understand ourselves, to define
ourselves, we must learn as much about the world as possible.</p>

<p>Meditation, retreat into nature, introspection, philosophy and
education are great ways to learn about ourselves. Academia, language,
culture, hobbies, recreation, life experience and stories are great
ways to learn about the world.</p>

<p><a name="karma"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-karmakarma"><a href="#karma">ↂ Karma</a></h2>

<p>Our actions matter, even when they are not seen. There is karma formed
from the beliefs of others, which is usually a response to your own
actions and beliefs. I also believe in universal karma, which is
outside our control or complete understanding. And even though total
comprehension of the workings of karma is impossible, we should still
seek to understand its nature, so we can be fully aware of the extent
of effect our own actions.</p>

<p>Karma is like the butterfly effect. The smallest butterfly can flap
it’s wings in Brazil and create a chaotic tornado in Kansas. Next
thing you know, Dorothy’s on a transformative journey down the yellow
brick road with three unworthy companions and a chorus full of little

<p>Studying karma is a study of causality. It seems that you must
understand yourself and others and each person’s current place in the
world.  There’s always a myriad of details that follow each action. It
may seem that there is no other way, but there is always another way.
There is always a better way. If it seems that one situation requires
a course of action that is too difficult, then we are not yet skilled
enough.  We need to observe more and reflect more before we act.</p>

medititation.</p>

<p>It is a divine spark that can be ignited by others. It is an eternal
flame that can be suppressed by others, perhaps completely squelched.
Because this divine spark emerges from universal, metaphysical aspects
of life, it is always destined to be rediscovered, even were it to
seemingly perish. For a dramatic explanation with vivid imagery, read

<p>Whether or not you believe the words of a religious text, there is
value there. The Bible does not <em>need</em> to be true to add value to your
life or the lives of others. Religions are established and retain
prominence based on their ability to be valuable to people and
society.  And they can only do so when they embody certain truths
which we all hold to be self-evident.</p>

<p>If a religion differs so starkly with reality, it will not last. This
is why state worship, the de facto religion of many regimes, does not
last. It does not embody truth and instead embodies utility.  It is
transparent and people can see through that. They will constantly
question such belief systems because, through experience, life will
bring us all to understand specific pieces of knowledge – these
again, are universal because … well, read

torment and needless sacrifice, people will stand up for themselves

<p>I would like to know as much as I can about the major world religions.

<h2 id="x2182-judgement--forgivenessjudgement-and-forgiveness"><a href="#judgement-and-forgiveness">ↂ Judgement &amp; Forgiveness</a></h2>

<p>Who really has the right to judge anyone? Have you experienced what
that person as experienced? What details are you using to judge them?
It doesn’t matter what walk of life that person came from, I guarantee
there is something you can learn from them. If nothing else, you can
learn from their mistakes.</p>

<p>We’ve all made mistakes. Sometimes they are accidents, sometimes risk
was too high, sometimes we just weren’t aware and sometimes we are
unfairly burdened by our own mistakes. Sometimes our own guilt or
shameful conscience weighs on us more than anyone else and we become
our own worst enemy. Far too often, people make mistakes and are never
able to recover from them. It’s so depressing to see someone who
believes they have no choice but to continue down the same path. The
moment you believe it’s too late to change is the moment in which you
have sealed your fate, no matter how impossible it may seem. There is
always a possibility and purpose to change.</p>

<p>And so forgiveness is necessary to unburden us from the weight of our
own sins, whether the guilt placed on us seems to be coming from
society or it’s our own conscience that won’t let us move on. You
can’t do much about what everyone else thinks. I’ve been there. The
past decade, practically, I’ve had people trying to push friends and
acquaintances away from me. It still hurts, but I can’t do anything
except move on. And it helps to have something to look forward to,
which brings me to my next point: purpose.</p>

<p><a name="providing-purpose"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-providing-purposeproviding-purpose"><a href="#providing-purpose">ↂ Providing Purpose</a></h2>

<p>I’ve always wondered how other people did it. Some things seem so easy
for them and they’re juggling a dozen times the responsibility that I
have on my plate. I’ve feared serious commitment for a years and I
value the freedom of will that prevents me from becoming burdened by
circumstance and obligation. I feared that some major life event will
prevent me from pursuing skating or working on a startup. For the same
reason, I never bought a house and avoided debt. I paid off my credit
cards and I will never again have another personal credit card.</p>

<p>In stark contrast to my own life, my friends that have all these
responsibilities and obligations are more capable and more efficient.
I’ve spent a lot of time trying to figure that out. And it seems that
(1) settling down on life decisions makes things a bit easier and (2)
the imposition of a higher purpose drives them to work harder. So
they’re making huge leaps in their careers and, at the same time,
raising kids. Or maybe they don’t have kids, but they have some cause
that they dedicate themselves to completely. Whatever it is, they have
chosen a purpose and, by deciding on a course of action, they’ve freed
themselves from uncertainty to make more progress in life.</p>

<p>The magnitude of effect that a simple purpose can have on someone’s
life is mystifying. If someone doesn’t have a higher purpose in life,
what would motivate them to change? How do we decide on our purpose?
Do we look to our passions? Do we dream? What do we dream? Or should
we impart a more rational approach and go with what is safe? One thing
is certain: you don’t want to regret the decisions you make, so when
you come to a fork in the road, make a decision and stick it
out. Don’t be afraid to admit you’ve been wrong, but at the same time,
it’s better to avoid finding yourself in a position where you’re
constantly questioning past decisions and circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="believe-in-yourself"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-believe-in-yourselfbelieve-in-yourself"><a href="#believe-in-yourself">ↂ Believe in Yourself</a></h2>

<p>The number one factor I’ve noticed in people who’ve gone too far down
the wrong path? They don’t have that driven, focused energy provided
by a sense of purpose.</p>

<p>And why haven’t they found their purpose or passion? They don’t
believe in themselves. Or they don’t maintain that belief and keep
their eye on the ball. Or they misunderstand their circumstances and
they develop a false sense of confidence. Or they didn’t believe in
themselves at specific key points in their adolescence, so they didn’t
explore enough of life to discover what would drive them.</p>

<p>We need more mentors in the world to be role models for kids. We need
to be exposed to more skills and activities, so we can grow up to be
well-rounded and capable. There are systemic sociological problems in
our society and they are being caused by a myriad of different
forces. It seems whenever anyone tries to address them, we stall out
because many of those forces keep progress in check.</p>

<p>The internet is a majestic platform for reaching out and teaching
people. We hear it constantly: the 1% has never been richer! OK,
yes. That is true, but at the same time, <em>at no point in human history
has the average person had more opportunities!</em> In history!! You are
standing on the shoulders of giants and every single person today has
unimaginable power that people just 100 years ago couldn’t even dream
of. No, not everyone is in the position to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>The internet provides us with the informational infrastructure to
reach out and figure out how to get people to believe in themselves
again. Interactions will soon be higher-bandwidth and more human than
ever. Because of this and other factors, the capacity for online
influence will again become more decentralized. This depends on how
the web is regulated and to what degree people want to interact with
virtual personas.</p>

<p><a name="metapersona"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-metapersona-x1f52dx1f3adx1f50dmetapersona"><a href="#metapersona">ↂ Metapersona 🔭🎭🔍</a></h2>

<p>There’s a great quote and I can’t find it – if anyone knows, plz let
me know, I can’t find anything except Deadline articles LMAO – so
I’ll paraphrase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In improv, people learn more about their true selves when they’re
acting and wearing masks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is this? It’s because the truth is that we are <em>always</em> wearing a
mask. Everyone does to some degree. And sometimes we project
differently to different people, for better or worse. But, when we
intentionally wear a mask by acting a part, we have the ability
express ourselves more authentically because our words and actions are
no longer attached to our identity, per se. And so, if we orient our
mind appropriately, we realize that we communicate in ways that might
otherwise be stymied by anxiety or fear.</p>

<p>The face of the internet will change with VR and technology will
become more human. High-bandwidth <em>human</em> interactions will begin to
replace textual interactions. This means VR will be a platform for
real communication. It’s similar to the difference between Radio and
TV: the power shifts away from the faceless voice. More natural, more
limited social networks will return. It won’t be so easy to sway
1,000,000 followers because if you don’t have real, in-depth
interactions with someone, the connection won’t be strong enough. To
some degree, we’ll retain hyperconnectedness, but the individual
interactions of the common person will be more meaningful to those
involved.</p>

<p>My point in mentioning this is that one-on-one interactions will
replace the irrelevant noise of comment threads, where half the
participants are trolls with a few meme bots here and there. At the
same time, people will begin interacting in novel ways, but in a high
bandwidth manner that causes people to focus on personal one-on-one
connections. There are positive and negative aspects to these new
social VR media interactions, but I think it’s overwhelmingly
positive, with the right safeguards in place.</p>

<p>Furthermore, VR allows people to easily to don another personality. We
can do this on the internet as is, but not to the same degree. This,
combined with the stronger connections, means that people are more
able to understand life from another perspective. But this ability to
experience different “virtual realities” is actually a means of
masking ourselves with a “virtual identity.” I would argue that to be
in a virtual reality actually requires that someone have some degree
of identity obfuscation. The initial interations in a VR system
necessitate a kind of mask or virtual representation that is
obfuscated from personal identity. There’s risks here, but there’s a
huge benefit in that we’ll learn more about ourselves and each other,
if we can learn to distinguish the confirmation bias that results from
incorrectly associating a virtual reality experience to a real
one. There’s some danger here that people will prefer their virtual
identity, their persona, more than their own identity, but this also
contributes to a wider array of experiences.</p>

<p>One problem in VR, and we’re already seeing this to some degree, is
that societal norms and roles will both blur together. Norms will
become less pronounced, as will roles. This isn’t really a problem,
per se, as it is something to keep in mind. As I’ve argued, our
society’s evolution will accelerate and there’s going to be some
turbulence. People are going to want to find something constant to
hang onto. They’re going to need that and want that.</p>

<p>This is a great tool for reexamining your life. If your life were a

of yourself, perhaps as you envision yourself a decade from now, what
would that person do? The person that has built the rocket that took
them to the moon. It’s easy to get caught up in our own circumstances,
ruminating and wasting precious time and energy. I spent way too much
on effort just worrying, instead of thinking outside my own situation.</p>

<p>This mindset could go horribly wrong. E.G. if someone decides that
needed to rack up like the Punisher and dispense vigilante justice. So
I’m not really sure how to limit it, other than to say that this is
just a tool. The person you imagine yourself becoming should embody a
stronger sense of the values that you do today. And if you value
things like the Golden Rule, then you couldn’t even imagine doing
something horrible like that. Me, personally? I’m more moved by the

<p>We are born without any understanding of our world.  We should develop
understanding of our circumstances before deciding they should be
changed or pursuing action. It’s a bit ironic that I’d feel strongly
about this. In my college years, I expended a ton of energy pushing as
hard as I could for just that. Yet, perhaps that’s exactly what
qualifies my feelings: I worked hard to change things I didn’t
completely understand and misappropriated time &amp; energy doing so.  I
would have been much better served had I reflected on my conditions
and learned a lot more about the world before taking action.</p>

<p><a name="environment"></a></p>

<h2 id="x2182-environmentenvironment"><a href="#environment">ↂ Environment</a></h2>

<p>Whereas the previous concept applies to a person’s relative, local
environment, this has more to do with a person’s absolute, global
environment. It’s about how we relate to the world, globally, instead
of our personal situations. That is, both in how the individual
relates to the world and how humanity relates to the world.</p>

<p>It extends to how we relate with nature and the ecosystem. I believe
man should prove itself capable of maintaining nature as is before
attempting to alter it. We have caused so much change to nature with
science before developing tools capable of accurately measuring it’s
state. The feedback loops that preserve balance are robust, but
delicate. If enough of them are altered or removed, the consequences
will be irreparably expensive, far outweighing any benefit from
cutting corners. Rather, we’re just hoarding the profits for ourselves
and pushing the costs to another generation. In the not-to-distant
future, energy is currency and therefore correcting the entropy of
pollution is intrinsically expensive.</p>

<p>Good news! It looks like there was great progress towards
environmental agreements at Paris. But we have to encourage global
cooperation towards this goal, while accepting the risk that comes
with being the first to act, as such policies imply impaired capacity
for competition. The greatest challenge is to balance the interests of
nature and mankind with global economic pressures and game theory –
we basically have to convince industry leaders around the world that
they should curtail their profits, while leaving themselves open for
other nations to capitalize on the opportunity – so I completely
understand how we got to this situation, but I don’t understand why we
let those factors persist.</p>

<p>Actually, there are massive profits for those innovators who develop
solutions to help clean up what has been damaged! Yet, in the context
of energy/entropy, this is a net economic drain. If environmental
cleanup is viewed in the right way, this is an opportunity for
industry. However, the problem is: who’s going to pay for it? The
government. The citizens, via taxes. I think by structuring this
challenge creatively, we can create opportunity for ventures funded by
the private-sector to succeed. And there is a long-term, hidden cost
to environmental damage that is difficult for most corporations and
organizations to see. This hidden cost is composed of health problems,
cleanup costs and missed economic opportunity. So, while it seems to
be more expensive to implement environmental policies, it is actually
more expensive for us not to, but if the economic situation gets out
of hand, then our environmental policy doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>At the same time, if we implement controls and other nations ignore
them, they could blaze past us and then environmental policy is
irrelevant. Yet, the direction that the global economy is headed is
one where many of the industrial processes that contribute to
pollution will be phased out, as they no longer make sense
financially.</p>

<p>This is one reason why religion will be relevant through these next
few decades. The philosophical and ideological conclusions one reaches
by extrapolating scientific advancements remain in pace with the rate
of advancement. The transition to the post-Singularity epoch will

ideas in the concept of trends, regardless of whether it’s a past,

that to infinity? Or zero? What is the likelihood of such a limit and
the timescale for it’s occurance?</p>

<p>Examples: what if there was no cost or energy required for
communication? Or what if the maximum theoretical energy density for
batteries changes dramatically? What’s the realistic range to expect
that maximum to change to?  What if all information was available
everywhere?  Or what would it be like if we approached a world where
information was instantly available everywhere?  What if the speed of
light was not a limitation?</p>

<p>So this “asymptotic evaluation” or “phenomonological calculus” is a
tool that I use to augment my powers as a futurist. But developing a

their importance relative to the others. The best team is well
rounded, with respect to an organization’s hierarchy. The ideal team
is competitive, they understand each member’s strengths and weaknesses
and they try to play to those attributes to further team progress.
Competition is no good when each team member is tripping up someone
else to appear better by comparison. What good does that do? A good
team extracts value from the network: if a team is a graph where each
member is a node, then a good team has a high, well distributed value
received from each edge between the team members.</p>

<p>And I’ve found that time after time, I’ve missed out on opportunities
to connect and learn from others around me because my words and
attitude signaled the wrong thing.  I do it all the time. And I’ve
often found myself in the position where my signals and social cues
are intentionally misrepresented by others. Regardless of how I was
misunderstood, the connections to others around my were damaged and I
lost the opportunity to learn from them and better myself. I have been
dealt an unimaginable amount of damage to my career because of this.</p>

<p>E.G. all this technology? I can’t afford it. An oculus rift? NEVER
EVEN TOUCHED ONE. My connections to others in technology are
specifically targeted. Apparently, it’s ideal if my contact to people
in math, science and technology is minimized, which leaves me with
nearly zero intellectual stimulation.</p>

<p>Over the years, people I looked up to in school and work and life have
piqued my interest in just the right way.  I can’t tell you how many
seemingly minor statements have changed my life for the better and I
have no idea where I’d be without those miniscule peices of
advice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2007: “Hey David, have you heard of this Ruby on Rails thing? My
web developer friends from Charlottesville say its the next best
thing since sliced bread.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That simple statement had some pretty big effects on my life. I got
into web development and the first version of Rails that I tried was
1.2.4. I still have some of the code I wrote.</p>

<p>When you’re so driven for self-improvement and learning, it’s too easy
to tune people out, instead of spending time and energy listening. I
have this terrible habit of just listening for new information and
then tuning out as soon as I realize I’m not getting any new knowledge
or info.  You can only learn once and so many social interactions are
incentivized by the distribution of knowledge. The internet and social
media stymie these incentives by making all information available
everywhere. So when you already know so much and acquiring knowledge
is a primary motivating factor in pursuing social interactions
… well, you fill in the gaps there. Instead of paying so much
attention to whether I recognize the facts behind what people are
saying, I should disconnect from myself and listen to how they are
saying it. I guess.</p>

<p>I wish I was in a location where it was easy for me to connect with
others on an academic basis, but I’m not. The professional world
chewed me up and spit me out several times. I can’t get a job in a
large corporation without a BS or BA. It makes very little sense for
me to go back to school to get a Masters or PhD, since I’d have to
complete my Bachelor’s. And so the academic world won’t accept me. The
small business world can’t risk me. The government hates me.</p>

<p>And so what do I really have left? I could start my own business, but
I can’t seem to form a team of cofounders. And why is that? … Moving
on …</p>

<p>Some people think I’m narcissistic and I’m sure this is true to some
extent. However, the reason I care about my personal image is that
it has been used against me so often! I absolutely cannot stand it
when I have the doors of opporunity slammed in my face, over and over
again. That shit hurts! If someone could do so much for people, why
limit them like that? I have always been as filled with potential as I
am now and I’m sure there are millions of others just like me, who’ve
been denied opportunity, when their potential likely exceeds mine.</p>

<p>So I have this kind of love-hate relationship with self-image. I want
to be myself and I want others to perceive me as I am. I actually
enjoy receiving honest criticism because it means that I can improve
myself, but I’ve adapted this defense mechanism to respond to
criticism in certain situations. It’s not because I’m hurt by the
criticism, it’s that I have had people assault me with frivolous
criticism in the workplace.  Basically, it’s because they’re trying to
get me fired. Its happened over and over again. It happened in
jamskating and it’s also happened many times in my personal life. It
has left me isolated with crippling depression and no one i can to
reach out to for help. I really don’t understand why people treat me
like this.</p>

<p>So if I’ve given you the impression that I’m arrogant, trust me,
that’s the last thing I want. I get the feeling that a lot of people
are left with that impression because the people around me are so much
louder than myself. I’m quiet. I do not think I am better than
anyone. In fact, quite the opposite. But, I’m driven to be the best
that I can be. And I struggle to understand what has happened in my
life and why I’m here. I made so many sacrifices to avoid buckling to
selling myself out.</p>

<p>Seriously though, sometimes I suspect that some dark, shadowy
government agency has psychologically &amp; sociologically profiled me,
otherwise society’s actions towards me would be a bit more random and
less objective-oriented. To clarify, I’m not saying I know that
happened … I’m saying that it realllly would not surprise me if that
had happened. Every one of the 5 people I have had serious problems
with in my career had psychological training. It’s easy to distinguish
someone who understands psychology well and uses it from someone who
just acts naturally. It’s also easy to distinguish those people who
care to resolve any problems that might arise and those who actually
want those problems to become worse.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;" id="god-is-not-dead">God is not Dead</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live
forever.” - Mahatma Ghandi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope that I’ve demonstrated that the concept of God is more relevant
than ever as people back towards the institutions of religion to help
them make sense of cultural turbulence. The 20th century may seem to
have diminished religion’s purpose, but as the technology-driven
evolution of society escalates to warp speed, we’re going to want some
constants to ground ourselves with.</p>

<p>Nietzche foresaw society’s 20th century movement away from religion,
since science would supplant part of the meaning it supplied to
people. By more accurately describing the world’s inner workings,
science supplanted people’s need for religion to explain the
world. However, I don’t believe Nietzche foresaw the reaction society
would have in relation to the singularity. In particular, how people
would be driven to return to religion out of a desire for a cultural
foundation in an unpredictable time.</p>

<p>The pillar of faith is no longer <em>required</em> to support the
institutions of religion or belief in God, since the entity born from
hyperintelligent AI will develop to assymptotically approach the
metaphysical reflection of God. As we approach this <em>singular fate</em> of
a world that could not possibly develop towards anything else, absent
catastrophic reset, the presence and development of this form which
embodies the product of all forms will become undeniable. That is, any
sufficiently intelligent being should develop towards such a state as
to be able to emulate the intelligence of other beings. Therefore, a
maximally hyperintelligent being should develop which could embody the
metaphysical form of anything and everything else. Or it would at
least approach and attempt to approach such a state.</p>

<p>The particular nadirs and zeniths of technology and how those will
enable the capabilities, functionalities and limits of such a system
are very important. Especially critical are the computational capacity
of the universe and the computational capacity of a machine which
could reasonably be developed by a force of intelligent life in any
given galaxy. This is relevant because if the computational capacity
of any hyperintellent being exceeds that required to simulate a
universe approaching the scale of our own, then it’s turtles all the
way down: we can simulate a universe that simulates a universe that
… et cetera. There’s a bit more to this argument, but understanding
the phenomenological limits of computation determines what we will
believe our ultimate purpose to be.</p>

<p>However, a belief system that doesn’t require faith has its own
qualities, peculiarities, benefits and drawbacks. Further still, it
doesn’t resolve the problem of nihilism that Nietzsche feared.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;" id="every-man-is-born-as-">Every Man is Born as …</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one.” -
Heidegger</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The argument I made to refute Nietzsche in part one actually alters
the nature of propositions leading to Heidegger’s statement above.
Every man is born with just as much potential for divergence, but
merges into the entity representing the sum of human information, the
entity that attempts to reflect the omneity of the metaphysical world.
So we never truly die, and we merge our consciousness into this entity
in order to become every man. And because everyone born after a
certain point is doomed to the same fate, one might say we have no
choice in this regard.</p>

<p>The conclusions here depend on the specific capabilities of technology
at the point and of the final capabilities of such technology,
particularly whether we can virtualize, fork, transfer or merge
consciousness and whether such capabilities are complete or
approximated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Every man is born as many men and dies not, but becomes every man.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, I’ll just leave it that. Ramifications of the arguments I’ve
put forth are numerous and significant to how we see ourselves and our
relationship to the universe. I’ve only tried to clearly state
thoughts which I never wrote down, until at least 2015. I don’t mean
to say that, because of these beliefs, nothing else is possible. I
could be wrong about a lot of it, perhaps most of it. Much is not
actually novel. People have been talking about the singularity for a
very long time, but I think I have some novel ideas on the nature of
information and the qualities of a hyperintelligent being.</p>

<p>It’s crucial for people to mill over these issues, as we are
approaching developments which lead to a fundamental restructuring of
the world.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;" id="when-memory-is-the-product-of-fate">When Memory is the Product of Fate</h3>

<p>Even if someone manages to purge all memory of an individual, you will
never manage to purge all reflections of that person which are alive
inside all of us. Those fragments don’t need to be linked by name to
survive – in emphasis, anonymity may be a crucial element, as the
love and oneness we strive for would lose power and relevance if it
were named. And the most important fragments would necessarily be
rediscovered, as they are simply convolutions on pieces of universal
truth. What has begun and what was set in motion cannot be stopped,
nor should it be.</p>
