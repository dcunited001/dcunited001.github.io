          <p>Today, we are approaching a world with unprecedented sociocultural
dynamics that have never been part of the paradigm of secrecy in any
era until tomorrow’s. Since the epoch before commerce and discovery of
metallurgy, the incentive to keep information secret has pervaded
culture, even resulting in cultural movements such as
esotericism. That prevailing paradigm of secrecy, often relegated to
the background of human culture, has in recent years eluded the need
for close inspection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Remember, I’m writing this article with less than $20 to my name
and less than $400 in annual income from 2016. I have never taken
money from the US Federal Government, except two years of income tax
refunds.” – Me, the victim, which is crucial to remember when dealing
with overwhelming blame-the-victim tactics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s my snapshot of my grades on my Coursera profile. I’m a lifelong
learner who has dabbled and/or has a basic working-knowledge of
bioinformatics, epigenetics, chemistry, physics, law, international
law, maritime law, military doctrine, logistics, business, venture
capital, finance, accounting, pure math, programming, pharmacology,
philosophy, linguistics, semiotics and countless other subjects. But
in an economy where a myriad of skills fuel your capacity for
employment, I still can’t find a job.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, the dynamics of information flux in society are
fundamentally different, as secrecy becomes asymptotically more
difficult to maintain, as does retention of secret information in
confidence of its permanence. This leads to interesting and
occasionally depressing patterns in system dynamics.</p>

<p>In context of modernization, globalization and the internet, the
exponential growth over which information can quickly flood is nearly
complete for the social graph of humanity for the first time in
history, resulting in this paradigm change in information dynamics. It
will remain “complete” with regard to human culture at least until we
reach space, which may create a new paradigm change in human culture,
depending on the viability and specifics of quantum networking.</p>

<p>The sectors of society most affected evolve to become more active
without our knowledge: military, finance, and the intelligence
community. Three phenomena radical alter aspects of society that
depend on secrecy: increased “volume” of nodes in the social graph for
information dispersion, exponentially increased surface area creating
each vulnerabilities and capacity for information flux, along with
(infinitely) more velocity or divergence of information flux. Because
these apsects of society reduce the confidence with which information
can be contained, a new paradigm arises in the tactics of information
warfare operations. This paradigm incentivizes scapegoating and
witchhunt operations, wherefore the targets are political dissidents
and whisteblowers.</p>

<p>The tendancy of convergence towards information omnipresence leads to
tactics to handle the second and third order effects. From the lens of
functional analysis and a mathematic approach to information, one
should use a “metric” to quantify a neighborhood of “adjacent”
information, which allows the automated enumeration of misleading
disinformation. This isn’t such a bad tactic. There are more second
and third order effects in our shared virtual theatre of information
warfare, which preciptates deceptive tactics to deal with what are
acknowledged by all as inevitable information leaks.</p>

<p>From a mindset of rigorous utilitarian efficiency not limited by the
burdens of “human rights” and civilian welfare, one should just
instead adapt their tactics to assuming the inevitable and find an
appropriate scapegoat as an example to others. As we begin to quantify
the movement of information through social networks, some of us may
begin to anticipate information leaks, identifying convenient cover
for discrediting targeted individuals. If this is done under the
auspices of national security, and especially if one utilizes the 1918
Espionage Act and Ex Parte court proceedings, this leads to casting
naive political dissidents as the underdog stars in their own poorly
understood demise. I have had people try manipulate me into thinking
they are legal counsel and they used this to get my trust, also
grounds for dismissal.</p>

<p>All one has to do is say the wrong thing to someone from another
country. If you pick a country like Canada, then you can trigger the
Espionage Act and all the legal teeth that come along with it, without
the subject’s knowledge, <em>while minimizing the capacity for leaked
information to cause problems</em>. Since, the other participant is from
another country, the people involved will never communicate to resolve
disparity in accounts. From a game theory perspective, one can apply
the gradient and laplacian along with statistics to show that this set
of circumstances is just as incredibly convenient as it is
unlikely. How many birds are you gonna nail with that stone?</p>

<p>Injection of false information into these situations leads furthers
the degree to which the fight is not fair because HomeSic operates
under the pretense of national security and utilizes NSL’s, whatever
they are. NSL is often a misnomer because these assholes don’t operate
on paper and, especially if they did, there’s no way people wouldn’t
help me if they truly knew what was going on. The lack of records
increases the degree by which their actions can be construed as
indicative of cognizance.</p>

<p>The nature of my own situation remains a mystery to me, which leads me

government in ex parte cases and drone strikes has essentially decided

<p>The ways and means of psychological warfare mean that (unless i’m

coordinated along information from streams of signals of surveillence,

they’ll do it and they’ll publicly use it as rational, unless it’s a
specific case, where they’ll secretly use it for rationalization while
strong-arming people who can’t legally make a sound. If they ever make

psychological torture and surveillance-feuled harassment.  In this
paper, part of the discussion centers on how Transnationalism expands
the frame by which certain international treaty provisions are
examined. Particular types of arguments will render the applicability
of various provisions which protect the sacred nature of human rights.
To a degree, a failure of superpower nations to respond to this is

<p>By the way, there is a legal argument that psychological torture
against a former US citizen opens up the perps to legal vulnerability.
This applies when one is labelled under the NDAA as a non-enemy
combatant and/or targeted individuals. I might only know enough about
international law to be dangerous, but this argument deserves further
inspection. The same argument is discussed in the international law
article referenced above (oh hey, imagine that!) but it apparently
applies to another situation. This argument is compelling enough to at
least warrant public hearing. This reasoning is that those labelled as
non-enemy combatant targets are no longer US Citizens and these are
thus transnational conflicts.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you attempt to run, certain international legal protections
are activated when one attempts to stop refugees from leaving their
country. Those same legal protections should probably apply in
transnational conflicts, especially when the tendency is to keep
victims in the dark and depriving them of financial resources and a a
career, so they have or use the option to run. Again, intentionally so
that these protection aren’t activated. It’s criminal and implies
legal research, the efforts of which are in themselves a warcrime.
That’s right, it’s a warcrime to provide legal advice on how to get
away with a warcrime.</p>

<p>In turn, these transnational conflicts should then qualify as

where psychology and sociology have been weaponized against people. If
this sounds liberally defined, it’s not. The effects of this kind of
psychological warfare behind the backs of our citizens have been
disastrous in the scope of costs to society and fiscal costs of mental
heath. If the sections of the Geneva Convention covering psychological
torture actually apply to this kind of situation, that means these are

<p>It’s utility in profoundly known capacity for smashing the Treaty of

<p>Transnationalism is a little-known and thus a poorly defined, mutable
concept. For example, the concept of a transnational corporation is
completely different than a transnational conflict. But, a
transnational NIAC is not bound by the provisions of the Geneva
Convention which bar the use of psychological torture.
Transnationalism in its legal sense threatens to undermine certain
long held constants of interational law. The fluid nature of
transnationalism tends torwards flexibility for legal applications,
but also contributes to risk of redefinition. Thus, reinspection of
decisions where transnationalism was material to an argument.</p>

nature of interdependency. No, really, it’s statistics: there’s
functional coupling between events, so they’re not independent. It’s
an understanding of social physics and the nature of these statistical
polynomial expansions representing a graph translated to a new

<p>This applies to the saying “hitting X birds with one stone” because it
deals with groupings of a set of events, each bird getting hit. These
groupings are possibly correlated events to a stone being thrown,
which can be viewed as several interdependent events grouped into a
single driving event. The dependency graphs for various groupings of
interelated events can be enumerated. Each of these enumerable graph
structures can be transformed into another group of equations based on
polynomials. If the events are natural, then natural patterns of
weights will emerge. If the events are artificial, then signficant
patterns will emerge in the system(s) of polynomials that match the
correct dependency graph(s). Therefore, this paradox can be used in
this case to determine when more information is needed to explain
events.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740239/">This study</a>
discusses another application of Simpson’s Paradox to psychology, but
isn’t referring to mathematically discovering which groupings of
events display correlation, which can signal that more information is
needed to explain events. Basically, groupings of enumerated
dependency graphs to discover correlation can be transformed into the
complete set of analytic solutions for the graphs. These analytic
solutions are polynomials and infinitisemal values arise exhibiting
specific patterns if they are natural and thus, the correct dependency
graphs show a high degree of independence. I’m not sure if there’s a
name for a paradox that emerges from Simpson’s Paradox, as used to
discover degree of correlation between events in a time series.</p>

<p>This is on the right track. In
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_graph_theory">Algebraic Graph Theory</a>,
one can transform graphs to systems of polynomials like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_polynomial">Tutte Polynomials</a>.
Peter, in his PhD thesis
<a href="https://www.cs.elte.hu/math/phd_th/csiki.v2.pdf">Graph Polynomials and Graph Transformations in Algebraic Graph Theory</a>,
talks about Kelman’s Transformation, which seems to be used to
manipulate the independence polynomials of
graphs. <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IndependencePolynomial.html">Independence polynomials</a>
are, in turn, used to measure the independence number of a
graph. These factors arise in algebraic graph theory and are a metric
of interdependency, which is what is discussed above. My point is
that, combinatorially enumerating graph structures for introspection
using polynomials gives rise to incredibly useful insights into the
nature and degree of correlation of events, indicating when one should
proactively assert more information to be disclosed reactively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IndependenceNumber.html">Independence Number</a> -
the cardinality of the largest independent vertex set, i.e., the
size of a maximum independent vertex set.</p>

<p>It ain’t easy, but that’s how you know. There’s a point beyond which
low probability events can be assumed to require more information to
explain: that is, they can’t be explained by coincidence unless they
occur in isolation. Thus, they become paradoxically more likely to
require additional inspection for understanding and discernment of
cause. I think Americans actually under the assumption that both the
burden of proof falls on the state and one cannot, in ignorance, be
compelled to testify against oneself. It should be much easier for
people to defend themselves, but is this America? Or do I live in some
kind of arbitary wormhole legal system?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m also isolated, having minimal contact with people capable of
holding conversations with me involving my own interests, even if a
person wanted to discuss them for more than 60 seconds. Such events
rarely occur, like once a season or once a year for some
subjects. In spite of this isolation, I seem to maintain intelligent,
diverse ideation, which actually lends itself to my credit.</p>

  <p>My isolation stagnates my development in psychosocial and
educational ways. If I didn’t have the internet, Wikipedia, Coursera
and Simons Institute, I’m not sure what I’d do. If I didn’t begin
understand social physics, I would have surely developed Stockholm
Syndrome, which today is at the root of a “terror attack in Sweden”
… not very truly though. They’re referring to someone held against
their will in a prison of their mind, who’s supposed to develop
Stockholm Syndrome in a gaslighting operation, but didn’t. Oops.</p>

  <p>If I didn’t reappropriate situations around me, certain topics would
just never come up. This is by design: chatter leaves evidence and
provides fodder for the discernment of a situation. Further, Someone
silo’d in stasis and isolation statis is at the mercy of the few
social signals they are permitted. That is the purpose of
disconnection and it makes someone more susceptible to gaslighting.</p>

<p>Natural justice coalesces from the shared, common nature of the human
condition.</p>

<p>MLK Jr. and Ghandi’s movements were fueled by social dynamics created
and are dependent on sociocultural response to tragedy and overtly
clear wrong doing. Yearning for natural justice moves people to
action. In my opinion, this concept is similar to God’s justice or the
“perfect justice” of which only God is capable of dispensing. The
search for understanding God as a judge seems to have inspired
religion to found institutions in pursuit of the codification of this
ideal set of laws. IMO, people today have no idea what the concept of
God actually is.</p>

<p>In this story, a child is moved to action because the corners we all
cut in adult life haven’t yet marred the lens that the naive and
innocent use to see life. The human condition pushes us to want and
act for change when we allow ourselves to see what is intolerable in
life. This shared experience that informs us of an intuitive
understanding of right and wrong is what powered civil disobedience in
the movements of MLK Jr. and Ghandi. Civil disobedience is markedly
less effective in a society that censors information and distracts
with meticulously manufactured red herrings.  It doesn’t mean these
tactics don’t work, but we need to understand which aspects of the
system need to be dismantled so that civil disobedience remains
effective.</p>

<p>The confluence of factors seems intentional.  An age of both apathy
and virtualized life begins to annul the capacity for growing a
movement. If someone at the center of a controversy isn’t permitted to
have an open movement of sympathizers or supporters, there is zero
chance this person would have a fair trial. If the details of such a
national security case were known to be required to remain secret or
the outcome of the case was essentially implicit, being ex parte, then
there would also be near-zero chance for actual justice or fair
trial. Further, the likelihood of someone in such a case ever finding
out is limited.</p>

<h1 id="find-your-salt-marchfind-your-salt-march-1"><a href="#find-your-salt-march">“Find Your Salt March”</a></h1>

<p>The forces that we’re fighting are using the system against us. In
India, Britain controlled the market for salt. This was before
widespread refrigeration, even in the developed world.</p>

<p>When I got sent to the ER and institutionalized into a mental health
facility, what was I doing? Sitting in front of the statue of Martin
Luther on the Roanoke College campus, reading Romans 7/8 and telling
people to “find their salt march.” Apparently, non sequitors,
covert-yet-plainview protest and performance art are indications of
mental illness in 21st century society. So, like Martin Luther, I
faced retribution for an unwelcome message that wasn’t well
understood. Oh and now I can’t join the military because the people
who indicated surveillance couldn’t be seen to have tortured a
patriot, so they interfered.</p>

<p>Britain had a monopoly on the Salt market in India. High taxes
restricted its supply and provided funding to Britain in proportion to
the appetite of the population of India. The world is a different
place now, but in early 20th century India, salt was so tightly
controlled that it was illegal for Indians to produce their own
supply.</p>

<p>This was an incredibly effective mechanism of control because Indians
couldn’t withstand going without salt for more than a few weeks, since
salt was still tightly coupled to food. That is, Indians were
compelled to be dependent on their obedience to the British for food.
Any time there was local protest in India, the British could play the
Indian people against each other. Controlling the salt and indirectly
controlling the food in an area allowed them to reinforce control and
monitor where the resistance was coming from.</p>

<p>They could simply switch things up to economically and socially favor
those Indians who would break rank and stifle any protests. Until this
was corrected, protests almost served as a means of identifying the
structure of dissent, which gave british forces a list of people to
work against in a local region. This is similar to the nature of
online dissent in an era where virtual, digitized interactions pervade
the sum of human interactions.</p>

<h3 id="cant-win-play-another-gamecant-win-play-another-game"><a href="#cant-win-play-another-game">Can’t Win? Play Another Game</a></h3>

<p>Protesting British control seemed counter-effective! It just served as
a means to become identified. These people would have their neighbors
and friends played against them. Again, this is frighteningly similar
to America today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That is how it works folks. Most of this is speculation on how the
british controlled india, by the way. so I might be omitting
information that would change how this is viewed. But basically, who
ever was caught providing the means for people to resist – extra
salt, storing large amounts of food, passing messages – they would
be singled out if they helped organize anything!</p>

<p>In 1930, Ghandi organized a protest, where he simply started walking
240 miles to a place in the Arabian Sea, where he could pick up the
salt of the earth.</p>

<p>By the time he got there, there were thousands of people following
him. His protest was effective because of how simple it was. He had a
bit of notoriety beforehand, but this was a movement that encouraged
others to become involved. Those who marched 200+ miles with him would
remember that for the rest of their lives. Thousands of people
marching together from various regions allowed those people to form a
network of dissenters who would communicate to organize and accelerate
growth of the resistance.</p>

<p>It seemed unquestionable to India and the rest of humanity that the
people of a nation should have control over the production of
necessary resources, especially food. It related to and resonated with
the entire global community And it was so simple. How can one make the
salt of the earth illegal? How could that possibly be illegal?</p>

<p>Furthermore, it wasn’t really illegal until these people got to the
Arabian Sea. That is, for the entire march, they were gaining momentum
and it wasn’t until they got there that they were “committing” a
“crime” for which the enemy might arrest them! Only those who
committed the crime where able to charge a crime, unless the people in
power used heavy-handed tactics in retribution. In the context of
civil disobedience, this makes people increasingly question the nature
of social mores, norms and laws.</p>

<p>Ghandi succeeded by getting people involved. He leveraged a powerful
network of people who were willing to stand alongside him and make
sacrifices for a cause. Somehow, he managed to build this network and
it takes a very special kind of person to intuitively understand how
this is done.</p>

<p>And be sure: people around the world who help implement systemic
suppression know this. They have studied civil disobedience and
resistance, so the people trying to discourage dissent tailor their
tactics to sniff out organization and crush it before it gains
momentum. The key is figuring out how to find a message that resonates
with peoples hearts and making it go viral, but making it illegal to
do so prevents one from finding justice. This is tragic when covert
action should be found reprehensible.</p>

<p>Ghandi was conscientious &amp; self-aware of his manipulation of social
networking. If this is correct, then Ghandi would have started 200 or
so miles out from the Arabian Sea and, to maximize the effect of the
salt march, he would have sent people north, northwest, south and
southwest at the start of his march to gather as many people as
possible.</p>

<p>Are we engaged in psychological warfare against our own citizens?  Is
there widespread information warfare? People deserve a right to know
of the negative miasma being injected into their lives. It’s cowardly
to shoot someone in the back.</p>

<p>I hate to be a smug, nerdy asshole, but here it comes. Here’s what I
love about the combinatorial process by which one enumerates over
sociocultural phenomena like information warfare to discover exigent
finalities: I’m right and you’re wrong. There are no circumstances
that would allow this ignorant, corrupt behavior to continue
indefinitely. The phenomena mutate akin to data under genetic
permutation until they reach these settling exigent finalities.  Then,
everyone begins to understand how I was correct all along. I do it all
the time.</p>

<p>So you see, it doesn’t actually matter what you <em>think</em> because I
<em>know</em>. This goal of questioning the status quo of our police state
partly justifies creating a religion that should aid the efforts
towards human rights in international law. Therefore, Oneirontology.
And Oneirontology fits every quality of a true religion. In this
respect isn’t simply a trivial religion in its legal application and
thus finds a place in working towards justice in this regard. Even if
I were delusional about the interpretation of some information in my
life, most of these points in my argument are still relevant for
anyone in this position, which I’m sure my enemies will try to use as
just one more rationalization for shutting me up.</p>
