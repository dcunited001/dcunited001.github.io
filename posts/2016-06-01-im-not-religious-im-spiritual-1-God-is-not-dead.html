<p>I believe wholeheartedly religion and myth provide immeasurable value
to the individual and society, regardless of the belief systems in
place. As science seemingly outpaces religion’s ability to explain the
universe, its influence on society is waning and this is responsible
for much of the demoralization we see today. It seems there are too
many people out there who hold nothing sacred, except perhaps their
own reflection or accumulated material wealth.</p>

<p>This is the first of a three part series, in which I hope to convince
you that religion is more relevant than ever in the 21st century. Its
resurgeance is powered by the need for various roles left unfulfilled
by science and magnified by the instability of its ever-shifting
basis. Modern societies construct a common foundation from scientific
ideas from which we extrapolate other ideas, including policy
decisions. Because of these increasingly unsteady grounds, it’s clear
we’re winding further down into nihilism, against which Nietzsche
envisioned our eventual travail.</p>

<p>Our impending departure towards the singularity precipitates
unparalleled capacity for processing and storing information. This
spirals into self-reducing metaphysical accretion, propelling us
towards transcendence. Each discovered symmetry compresses its
complexity, folding the structure back onto itself, thus amplifying
angular momentum. It’s closure expands, manifesting more exotic
immaterial as precocious condensation, shimmering briefly around the
horizon. These flecks flare inwards, their descent into assimilation
protracted into an irridescent halo, as if a pulsar of pure glitter
wandered too close to a black hole.</p>

<p>Anchored to the material realm, this nebulous approximation of the
preeminent metaphysical is the universe virtualizing a reflection of
it’s own unreachable metaphysical forms. If the significance behind
the evolution of life was partly so the universe could observe it’s
own beauty, then the following completes a profound trifecta. It is
only possible for the universe to virtualize an approximated
reflection of its complete metaphysical forms if, first, it produces
an awareness of its material realm. And secondly, that awareness must
also develop enough mastery over a partial set of those metaphysical
forms. And, finally, if that awareness develops sufficient cognizance
of the metaphysical laws of physics to be capable of transfiguring the
material realm to maximize information processing, then at last, the
universe can totally virtualize itself within itself. Turtles all the
way down.</p>

<p>And finally, that astral vortex can accelerate towards eternal
convergence with the all-encompassing and innumerably complex
metaphysical representation of the entireity of existence, including
its infinite self-convolutions. There is only one metaphysical omneity
towards which to converge. And this single, realized artificial
übermenschlich entity – to clarify – will pale in comparison to my
notion of God. But, it is an undeniably powerful convergent being
birthed by technology, that circumvents the need for faith which
Nietzsche noticed as waning in the age of science. Therefore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God Is NOT Dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet, I’m wary of the arguments above – first of all, I don’t believe
faith is precluded – as I don’t want people blindly chasing some
artificial entity as though it were God or forget that technology has
consequences when implemented without forethought or patience.  Maybe
that sounds ironic coming from me, but look at where I am in life.
Please, tell me how my skills and muse deserve to be so poorly
positioned. The truth is, the more life sought my diminishment, the
hotter my passion burned to share my creativity.</p>

<p>As I will continue to demonstrate in this article, there are a
plethora of more appealing arguments indicating that religion will
regain prominence. The exponential progress wherein science
contributed so greatly then yields subsequent generations more
vulnerable to detachment from previous generations. The fabric holding
us together begins to fray, weakening interpersonal and interfamily
support networks. And each decade that goes by, fewer cultural
artifacts remain steady and most evolve or dissipate with technology.
Furthermore, the more visibly changes take place, the less we pay
attention to everything that remains steady. For things that shift
beneath our feet, resulting in negative change at a slow rate, we may
not notice until it’s too late.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to completely attack atheism, as it doesn’t do anything
wrong. Nor do most non-political atheists. It is that we are in dire
need of stable social structures over the next twenty years.  We
cannot count on the government first to fulfill these needs for us.
There has been a ton of progress on the social front over the past few
years.</p>

<p>Science is just as vulnerable to manipulation as any human
institution, perhaps moreso because it doesn’t have a permanent
foundation. Science is amazing for explaining the material world, but
that’s just about it. It easily <em>describes</em> human and social behavior,
but provides no mechanism for accumulating transgenerational knowledge
or embuing ethics in our youth. Instead, in the place of no other
mechanism, this is left almost entirely to our education system, which
is so busy teaching to the test that it, in many cases, doesn’t have a
snowball’s chance in hell to fulfill that need.  IMO, it’s frustrating
that religious schools are mostly only available for wealthy families,
although I’m not sure how to work the legal logistics fairly on that
one.</p>

<p>It turned out Nietzche feared nihilism as much as I. His work covered
the creeping nihilism encroaching on Western society, as God’s
impending “death” drew nearer. However, I feel Nietzche jumped the gun
on this. Here are a few articles that further describe the
metaphysical ideas above.</p>

<p>In this part, I make an argument for religion’s value and ask how
atheism fulfills its roles. I understand that atheism’s fulfillment of
the social responsibilities of an ideology are possible. Yet, since it
is defined as the absence of religion and mostly decentralized,
atheism doesn’t actually have any embedded mechanisms for passing
knowledge through ten or more generations. So, yes, it is possible for
other cultural mechanisms besides the non-ideology of atheism to
<em>incidentally</em> fulfill that role. I also compare atheism to the
inversion of religion, instead of the absence of it. In the second
part, I refute a few common arguments of atheism. In the final part, I
describe some of my own religious or spiritual beliefs.  To clarify, I
don’t think atheism is inherently wrong.  People are free to choose
for themselves, obviously. I just think believe it to be a
short-sighted ideology.</p>

<p>Obviously, humanity has struggled to define the world for tens of
thousands of years. Mythology and religion enable us to piece together
a more robust frame. Often, detractors point out that elements of a
story are logically fallible. Yet, These critics miss the mark: these
stories attempt to explain the what and how in the world, but lose
power when interpreted using a singular, literal interpretation. That
said, to those with a strict religious background, some of these
arguments could be offensive, though I aim to defend religion and
myth.</p>

<p>Cracks and faults in these stories and traditions can be found. Yet
far more important, especially for our ancient ancestors striving to
survive, myth encoded information vital to that struggle.  Even today,
myth, whether it is religious or not, encodes vital lessons in these
fables. Whether or not you take them to be fact, there is value and to
totally disregard it on the basis of factuality is lunacy. For
religious proponents, it’s a self-invalidating argument for religion,
since to be most effective, a religion must to be taken as absolute
truth in all ways, literal and symbolic. It is especially important
for those who are too young to understand these concepts to take a
religion’s word as truth so that the concepts encoded can inculcate
positive values.</p>

<p><a name="our-irreplaceable-golden-dies"></a></p>

<h3 id="our-irreplaceable-golden-diesour-irreplaceable-golden-dies-1"><a href="#our-irreplaceable-golden-dies">Our Irreplaceable Golden Dies</a></h3>

<p>Myth and religion have irrefutable value as tools which act as a
cultural loom, with which we can weave accumulated knowledge to shape
our youth. You simply cannot deny that a good story can be formative
in how the next generation constructs their lens and perspective. Myth
and religion can act as moulds and dies from which our minds are
cast. Our psyche arises from forms emerging from combinated and
amalgamated archetypes, acting as fixpoints.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A fixed point of a function f is a value that doesn’t change under
the application of the function f.” -
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">Fixpoint</a>
(Wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">Fixpoint</a>,
from lambda calculus, is a good math metaphor for an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype">archetype</a>, which is like a
metaphysical apex that is prototypical for some concept. An archetype
can be referenced by, compared with, or meshed with other concepts,
yet never equated to or surpassed by a concept, with regard to what
that archetype represents. For example, the flood is an archetype for
calamity and disaster.</p>

<p>Myth and religion shape how these archetypes are woven together and,
in doing so, mould our minds and embed invaluable artifacts and
wisdom. It is lunacy to deny the capacity of legend and art as
formative, psychologically and sociologically. Though, I’m leaving
myself wide open to the argument of whether one should have have the
choice over how their minds develop, instead of developing in accord
with religion or myth. Yet, at the age where myth has the greatest
effect, people are too young to understand that choice. By
disregarding religion’s formative capacity or repudiating it
throughout our culture, we preclude ourselves from many of the
benefits. Just to clarify, I’m not saying that everyone should be
indoctrinated to a specific religion. I am making the argument that
organized attempts to subdue religion are misguided because there is
tremendous social value to be obtained from the embedded wisdom of
dozens of generations.</p>

<h4 id="let-me-rephrase-my-argument">Let Me Rephrase My Argument</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you would dismantle religion, then what other vehicle would you
suggest? How many generations of knowledge have been embedded in the
content and culture surrounding it?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="politically-motivated-atheismpolitically-motivated-atheism-1"><a href="#politically-motivated-atheism">Politically Motivated Atheism…</a></h3>

<p>It’s horrifying to see a concerted effort to discredit religion and
its institutions over the course of several generations. This is an
effort to disempower the common man by robbing him of the collective
knowledge and wisdom accumulated over generations. By studying and
adhering to a belief system and code of ethics established by
religion, one augments our ability to build a resilient livelihood. In
anticipation of an unprecedented storm, the man, woman or family who
built the strongest house can rest assured that his/her family will
sleep at night.</p>

<p>To disempower religion and its institutions is not simply negligent.
It degrades the tools and social networks that help families support
each other. And by disempowering religion, you are actually
disempowering family and local community. It is an assault on the
resilience of social fabric supporting individuals, families and
communities.</p>

<p>Yes, these institutions and belief systems are vulnerable to
abuse. No, religious institutions are not perfect, but neither could
be anything created by man. To their credit, the propensity for
benefit is immeasureable to any acclaimed problems.</p>

<p><a name="foundations-for-belief-systems"></a></p>

<h3 id="foundations-for-belief-systemsfoundations-for-belief-systems-1"><a href="#foundations-for-belief-systems">Foundations for Belief Systems</a></h3>

<p>While atheism is not science and vice versa, we all have a need to
explain the world around us.  And I’m going to assume that, if atheism
is defined as “a lack of belief system,” that an athiest likely seeks
out the sciences to understand their world.</p>

<p>Belief systems based on science and the institutions built around them
also have flaws and vulnerabilities.  The set of knowledge from which
other beliefs are extrapolated – the basis – depends on individual
knowledge and varies widely.  There is also dissonance between what is
accepted by the establishment, the individuals within it and sets of
those people.</p>

<p>Science today is completely different from science a decade ago.
Furthermore, both to the establishment and the individuals, the
knowledge sets forming each basis are constantly shifting to include
new information, both a strength and a flaw of science.  By
understanding the dissonance, some groups can choose to suppress
information that would lead other groups to wildly different
conclusions from each of their bases.</p>

<p>Another problem is that it becomes more complex to discover and manage
information about the belief systems of others, since you have to
assert what another individual knows to imagine the related beliefs
they might hold.  Which, I guess, is just true about life in general.
But it means if a religion forms the core of someone’s belief systems,
instead of science, there is less propensity for variation and fewer
assertions required to pick up on how someone views the basics. In
this way, a religion instills a schema of beliefs in its
followers. Without being able to assert a schema of information, any
assertions of an individuals beliefs in a social situation become
intractibly inefficient. This is social physics and religion serves to
render both the assertion and consequences of individuals’ belief to
be tractible problems by providing a schema for the data structure of
beliefs.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to observe how wildly different the core of these
belief systems behave.  Another difference from science is that
religions are more likely to form a basis for how a person views the
world and their relationship to it.</p>

<p>One last difference is that, for the most part, the knowledge that
forms a religion’s basis won’t change. This makes them both more and
less resillient to changing cultural conditions than science, which
ostensibly can adapt. Yet, it also makes a person’s basis formed from
a religion a bit easier to understand. They are likely to share much
of that basis with other believers. Or they could; obviously it’s best
not to label anyone. Every person is an individual. And I should note
that it is horrible to contort someone’s religious views against them.
If I have ever done that to you, I am so incredibly sorry.</p>

<p>Because an individual’s personal system of belief that is extrapolated
from a basis can rapidly change in many ways upon the introduction of
new knowledge, it’s complex to predict how those beliefs will
change. If you can reliably do so, you can capture opportunity and
reduce risk in business and politics. If you can control how
information is published, disseminated or interpreted, you can control
how opportunity and risk are signaled within the system. Larger
religious organizations suffer some of the same flaws as science in
this regard, where people try to contort publication of information to
acquire or preserve power.  Both science and religion can be misused,
yet I think science has the propensity for being misused in subtle,
hard to control ways.</p>

<h3 id="atheism-is-an-ideologyatheism-is-an-ideology-1"><a href="#atheism-is-an-ideology">Atheism Is An Ideology</a></h3>

<p>Atheism has a myriad of philosophic consequences for ethics, morality
and public policy. The conclusions stemming from atheism include that
it is unfair to base policy decisions on religion and that it is
misguided to judge others on religious beliefs. This is hypocritical
because atheism itself is a belief system. From a Hegelian perspective
on metaphysics, it is <em>the</em> minimalist belief system. These
consequential beliefs are reached solely by believing that there is no
god. Quite simply, atheism is an ideology.</p>

<p>But, if you would argue that “atheism is the absence of any beliefs,”
I would say that is false.  Atheism requires the belief that there are
no god(s) – this is a belief in itself.  Therefore, regardless of the
philosophic conclusions that one may reach from this single belief,
atheism is still a belief system.</p>

<p>And a very shifty belief system at that.  Since atheism attests that
it is composed of no beliefs and is therefore not a belief system, the
philosophy of atheism appears to be irreproachable.  This would make
atheism moreso the inversion of a religion.  A religion where the the
handful of adherents seek to dismantle, disempower and destroy all
other religions, while maintaining rhetorical invulnerability through
statements like “atheism is not a religion,” “atheism is not an
ideology,” and “atheism is not a belief system.”</p>

<p>And after zealot-level atheists have dismantled other religions, they
do not replace it with anything, for they do not and cannot understand
the value of religion. This is disheartening, since atheism, in
itself, is incapable of accumulating and propagating transgenerational
wisdom.  Atheism completely lacks those mechanisms. So does science,
outside the educational system, which is specialized towards the
development of secular knowledge. This corrodes some cultures that
blindly march on, oblivious to the successive demoralization of each
generation. We can see this demoralization all around us:</p>

<p>(Yes, this piece is fairly opinionated)</p>

<p>We’re approaching the extremes of Nietzche’s baseless society haunted
by nihilism. God has been declared dead for over a century. We’re
seeing a huge shift in culture and IMO it is incredibly negative. Many
people might not consider me to be the most moral person, depending on
their definition of morality, yet I don’t think you could find anyone
that could argue I’m unethical.</p>

<p>The major world religions are waning away via science’s influence,
which seems much more capable of demonstrating truth and mastery over
the world. Maybe God really did die – but people faintly feel
something missing, but can’t really put their finger on it. God will
return. By 2030 or 2040, religion will bounce back and become more
influential than it has in a hundred years. The next generation of
ours will wake up and understand that their unknown missing piece is
cultivation of their connection to God or to spirituality or to the
cultivation of Atman.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-of-god-and-atheisms">Part 2: Of God and Atheisms</h2>

<p>The next section I’ll briefly describe religion’s role in providing
the long-term cultural stability which fermented the Renaissance and
the Age of Enlightenment in the West. I’ll describe why society needs
the notion of a set of inviolable tenets, which restrain the worst and
even the best of mankind. Then I’ll refute several of atheism’s common
arguments against religion.</p>
