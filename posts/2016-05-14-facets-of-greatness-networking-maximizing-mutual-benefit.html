          <p>Networking is about designing, structuring, building and maintaining
your social networking by establishing new connections.  Communication
– and signaling, to some extent – is about leveraging your
network. Or that of your connections or organization.</p>

<h3 id="meatspace-networking">Meatspace Networking</h3>

<p>… And honestly, networking might be one of my biggest weaknesses,
but I haven’t had way too much practice, as I can’t drive. And when I
have worked on a startup project, I’ve regrettably worked alone,
spending the majority of my time programming.</p>

<h3 id="your-contact-list-is-gold">Your Contact List is Gold</h3>

<p>The contact list you build is one of your most valuable assets.  This
is one reason that I keep my Facebook friends private, even though
almost everything else I’ve done on that site has been private.  In
sales, depending on agreements with your employer, it could be
unethical to try to carry your contact list to leverage them at your
next job.  So there’s a ton of value there.  It doesn’t matter what
your profit margins are if you don’t have customers.</p>

<h3 id="mutually-beneficial-connections">Mutually Beneficial Connections</h3>

<p>In order to further your relationship with customers, or even friends,
you need to get to know them.  You have to develop a rapport with a
connection to develop comfort and trust, then you have to the chance
to understand their needs and how you fit together.  No one wants to
buy something they find out they didn’t really need, so even if you
managed to sell someone in that case, you didn’t provide long-term
value, so you’re not likely to have a repeat customer.</p>

<p>It’s terrible to think of people as walking ATM’s, and if you treat
them like that, you’re not going far.  Yet, when you develop
connection where value flows in both directions, then the relationship
is mutually beneficial and that’s how life works.  It works in
business and in friendship.  It’s sad, very few people would say they
want to be in a one-sided friendship, where one party receives all the
value.  Anyone who would want that likely doesn’t have great
self-esteem.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-valuable-channels">Identifying Valuable Channels</h3>

<p>So the idea is to find people who share interests or needs. A great
trick to this is find where people talk about the thing you’re
interested in.  It could be a forum, an online class, a widely known
twitter hashtag that seems to consistently spark discussions, or a
meetup group.  You can even spark random conversations with complete
strangers.  Some of these channels are going to provide more value
than others and many of them will be outright time sinks.  You have to
find the ones that offer the most bang for you buck.  High bandwidth,
personal communication channels are the best, since you grab that
person’s attention and you can read facial cues to gauge interest.</p>

<p>As widely connected as social media is, I’ve found that it’s a huge
time sync, unless you’re a “power user” … I’m a software developer
and I suck at social media. I think “power user” means you can afford
to buy influence from bots or something. I donno.  IMO, buying
influence is cheap.  In my personal experience, facebook promotion
never worked for me.  I spent like $200 on that shit for my personal
account (sorry facebook) just to see what would happen and it was
basically like a broken arcade machine.  Regardless, for me, social
media is highly distracting and I tend to kill any discussion I post
on.  Go figure. It could be a facebook thread with 100 comments, but I
post on it?  It’s dead in the water…. interesting, n’est-ce pas?</p>

<h3 id="the-elevator-speech">The Elevator Speech</h3>

<p>Anyways, once you’ve identified the channels, you can engage other
people.  You can use the elevator pitch to introduce yourself, which I
picked up in Toastmasters.  Their rewarding program connects you with
experienced public speaking mentors with, if you’re like me and need a
ton of work here. You’ll find these mentors to be influential leaders
in your local community, valuable connections with constructive
advice.</p>

<p>Toastmasters taught me about the elevator speech, which is a short 30
or 60 second speech that you imbue with your own style to introduce
yourself quickly and confidently. You don’t want a mechanical cookie
cutter introduction for yourself, but the more you practice the easier
it becomes.  You can build these quick elevator speeches for other
topics or cater them to a specific audience.  You’re going to need
something short, but flexible, that offers plenty of interest points
for the other party to grasp onto.  Usually, you’ll hit a common
interest.  If not, you’ll find that many other people will begin
talking about themselves with little encouragement.  Honestly, that’s
best because you don’t have to expend much effort at first and there’s
plenty value there if you’re a good listener.  However, if you’re like
me, then you don’t like talking about yourself much … even though
it’s just about all I can talk about.  So I just stay quiet mostly.
Again, it’s a “protracted isolation” thing.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-high-value-connections">Identifying High Value Connections</h3>

<p>Regardless, you’ll find that the higher value connections out there
usually don’t want to share as much. Or they are more difficult to
approach.  You can tell by observing the way people act – and there
are plenty of people out there who want to act like this, but don’t
pull it off right because it doesn’t come from the heart.  When people
act less approachable out of conscious motivation to do so, it will
usually become apparent after you talk to them for a minute. You have
to listen to the space between their words.  They might be a true
high-value person or they might just be faking it ‘til they make it.
It’s OK, all of the best out there did it LOL. Also, since these
people are constantly approached by others, they become bored easily
and they’ve experienced all the games.  That’s yet another reason to
be authentic.</p>

<p>You’ll need to think more about what you’re trying to get out of
networking. Are you looking to meet new customers?  Or are you looking
for an investor or business partner? There are different tactics to
match various situations.</p>

<h3 id="vetting-new-connections">Vetting New Connections</h3>

<p>I’ve noticed that some people seem to be very good at quickly vetting
the experience level of other people.  Versitility here is invaluable
for interviewing, but also for networking.  Almost anyone will want to
convince you that they are better than they actually are at some
skill, so you need to be able to quickly test someone.  You can do
this with ease if you are knowledgable in that field, but what if you
aren’t?  There are some general tactics for flushing out someone’s BS,
but they aren’t guaranteed to work.</p>

<p>If you’re considering getting into a working or personal relationship
with someone, then you’re going to want to make some assertions about
their character.  There are right and wrong ways to probe someone on
experience level or skills.  It’s kind of like a logic paradox, where
if you ask just the right question, it doesn’t matter if the guy is
telling the truth or lying, you’ll get the right answer.  Honestly, I
don’t know how they figure this shit out.  But the people who make
great managers are always proficient with this.  I would know, I’ve
been through a ton of interviews.</p>

<p>Also, just because someone isn’t highly experienced at the time
doesn’t mean they’re not a valuable connection.  Is this person young
and ambitious and on their way up?  They’ll probably remember who
connected with them early on and helped them out.</p>

<p>These questions and topics to sound someone out will vary, depending
on the industry, topic, skill, experience level, etc.  There are
several command line Linux utilities that you can ask about.  If
someone has solved certain problems, like compiling the Linux kernel,
then they’ll know about them.  They’ll be able to describe how they’ve
used those utilities in the past.  This is much more effective than:
have you ever compiled the Linux kernel, yes or no?</p>

<p>As you progress in your career, you’ll develop more expansive
knowledge and become more qualified to interview on a wider variety of
topics. You’ll pick up more subtle cues that indicate trustworthiness
and combined with the right information about experience, you can
easily find the distinguished applicants.  Or that’s what I hope.  I
don’t have any experience with interviewing, but I’ve spent a lot of
time thinking about it, since I’m worried my weaker social skills will
hurt my ability to form a strong early team, unless I hire someone
with an MBA or equivalent experience. Or a lawyer. They’re good at
sifting through BS. And handy for business law, too.</p>

<p>Another way to vet people is to leverage an existing connection –
someone you know to be trustworthy.  Arrange a meeting or facilitate a
connection between these two people and see what your connection
thinks.  It’s best to steer away from introducing these people for the
obstensible purpose of learning more about someone’s proficiency,
definitely for the person you’re sounding out.  And it works best if
you can arrange it so that neither party knows the purpose. Yes, that
can reduce the effectiveness, if one person doesn’t know they’re
supposed to informally vet this person.  You can always hint or make
it known later on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>General rule of thumb: line things up so you can hit two birds with
one stone.  Or five birds.  More is better here.  And don’t make it
known why you threw the rock.  Or that it was even you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="practicing-interpersonal-techniques">Practicing Interpersonal Techniques</h3>

<p>If you find yourself lacking in some of the techniques for execution
of networking, then there are plenty of ways to practice.  The first
idea is to get as much practice as possible.  It doesn’t help anyone
<em>to be isolated</em>.  How many times am I going to say <em>isolated</em> in this
series of articles?  Can I ask a psychologist whether or not it’s good
for someone who has Asperger’s and is socially inept to be placed
within a literal invisible fence? … Does it fucking seem like I
would like to remain disconnected from the world? My point is that,
while I’m not good at this stuff and even though I need a ton of
practice, I obviously know the things I need to know to improve at
least someone. Yet, there seems to be a problem.  I can’t ever drive
during daytime hours. Ever talk to someone who works late night
shifts? Is it easy for them to make new friends? I wonder why.</p>

<p>… Moving on.</p>

<h3 id="gamifying-networking">Gamifying Networking</h3>

<p>So another good idea to improve your networking skills is to find ways
to gamify it.  You can do it by yourself or with a friend!!
Basically, you’re just setting small goals that you keep in mind for
the duration of some networking event.  Set an expectation like: get
ten business cards or meet ten new people.  You can gauge your
progress over longer periods of time if you want, but the point is to
motivate yourself to make more connections at an event or increase the
quality of the connections formed.  The best sales guys (as well as
the better friends) are going to brainstorm ways of talking to
specific connections hours, days or weeks before an event.  If you
spend the time thinking about how you’re going to talk to someone
specific in mind or what you’re going to talk about, it should go more
smoothly when it happens.  This is because you’ve spent that extra
time thinking about that person, their life, their interests, etc.</p>

<p>You could even challenge yourself by competing with other people in
your sales department or amoung your friends.  You can suggest an
informal competition to find the most interesting person or find the
best reaction to a terrible joke.  Or find a person who owns X car. Or
has done A, B, and C.</p>

<h3 id="networking-in-19th-century-america">Networking in 19th Century America</h3>

<p>We’re incredibly lucky to have social media.  Thinking back to the
19th century economy, it amazes me to think back to previous centuries
before the internet and phone systems.  I find myself pondering what
it would be like to remain a step ahead of your competition at that
time.  If you owned a furniture store, you would spend an exorbitant
amount of time checking prices and quality of products from
wholesalers and manufacturers.  You would build a network of local
manufacturers and spend time cultivating those relationships.</p>

<p>How much of your time would you spend doing that?  How would you stay
ahead of your competitors?  What systems &amp; processes would you enact
to ensure you were capable of collecting the best information on
furniture?  How would you determine what is worth manufacturing
locally and what is more profitable elsewhere?  How would you stay in
contact with previous colleagues?</p>

<p>It seems that before the advent of instantaneous communication that
business – and especially retail, manufacture and distribution – was
all in who you knew and how you could leverage your social network in
order to maximize its benefits.  This was a time when doing so would
be costly in terms of time and energy.  Because of the increased
difficulty, the ability to do so would be very profitable.  Thus, in
previous centuries, efficiently receiving information was a critical
factor in determining success for those fortunate enough to own
businesses in that time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, information distribution is no longer constrained by the
limits of space and is beginning to transcend time.  This presents a
different kind of challenge, but it means your social network
connections are almost more valuable.  Who are you tuned in to on
Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.  I’ve personally noticed a huge
difference in the quality of content between the various networks,
primarily because I’m connected to different sets of people on each.
The most valuable information I receive, concerning business and
technology, comes from Twitter, where I’m connected to many
influential people I don’t know.</p>

<h3 id="social-media-networking">Social Media Networking</h3>

<p>There are strategies applicable to each social network. Social media
has become much more diverse, now that there are a dozen major
networks instead of Twitter and Facebook. Snapchat is great, but it’s
expensive in terms of time and effort for engagement. Yet, the
tradeoff is stronger, more personal connection for engagement.</p>

<p>The appropriate tactics depend on what what you’re trying to get out
of each network.  Do you want the most followers or the most engaged
followers – hint: you want the most engaged followers.  Ultimately,
what you want has nothing to do with numbers: you want to people’s
attention.  You want to spend time thinking about your content.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with social media is that I don’t engage with
content that other people created as much.  You’d be surprised at the
people who will end up responding to you in some way, but you’re more
likely to get a response if you identify people who are looking to
connect with others.  People want to “trade up,” so you can use Klout
to identify people interested in your topics who have a similar or
lower Klout score and converse with them.  Find the people who seem to
have an inaccurately low Klout score.  Or, forget about influence and
Klout algother and just find positive people who want to talk about
the stuff you want to talk about.</p>

<p>Identifying the right nuggets at the right time is crucial. You want
to find content that’s on the up and up: if you re-share something
that has 4,000 shares, what good does one more do.  But if that
reshared piece went from 10 to 4,000 a day later, then it’s more
likely that you identified interesting content early.  So, how do you
identify content is likely to trend?</p>

<p>I find myself wanting better tools.  Not for producing posts, but for
consuming them and identify ripe content to interact with.  I tried
HootSuite, but I still don’t like maintaining the extra web portal and
working through the channel based web interface.  I’m probably doing
it wrong.</p>

<p>It’s vital to prune our social network contacts and filter out the
ones who are uhhh sucking it up with recycled memes.  No offence, but
the one about Sponge Bob and Hank Hill, I already saw it.  Different
words though.  A+ for effort.  To each his own, I guess.  I don’t want
to ignore these people either.  I really don’t like the “Hide” button
or whatever.  But by unfollowing, you condense the information so that
it’s more valuable.  I would suggest creating multiple accounts …
fuck that – that makes my facebook account sound like a job. Also, by
narrowing your follow list down, you’re signaling to content producers
an indication of what is valuable.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point: social media is democratic. One like
equals one vote.  Those newsfeed algorithms are powerful and valuable.
They determine what is likely to be seen and what is not.  In my own
newsfeed on facebook, there are a set of friends who consistently get
like 30-100 likes on every single thing they post, but I’m lucky to
get a single comment or interaction. Ever. I don’t get it. People have
told me “well, you can’t drive, but at least there’s all these online
social media connections” …. PFFFTTT LMAO.  Yeh, let’s trade
accounts for a month and let’s see how you feel after that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, that’s a spectacular idea: trading accounts. Just for
kicks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I once sent out 75 messages after returning from an Instacart
interview in San Francisco to promote their product.  I didn’t expect
to get anything out of it, but I included a referral code.  I hoped to
seed users in their active markets (there were only 10 major cities at
the time) and I was curious as to whether Instacart would ever figure
that out in their analytics.  That they rejected my employment – no
hard feelings really, though I calculated $2 million in stock options
after 3 years of employment – but I still cared so much about their
product that I devoted like 4 hours to sending facebook messages.  You
know how many people responded to me?  Five.  Just five.  Or less.
Yeh .. a bit spammy, I know, so I’m not mad.  Whatevs.  I was curious
to see who would respond and whether Instacart would ever pick that up
in their analytics.  And I had a genuine interest in promoting their
product.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have I said isolated yet? Did I say that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People use Facebook and Twitter differently: there are different
categories of usage behaviors.  Do you have custom lists and newsfeeds
set up? I do. Do you use them? I don’t. The main feeds are so engaging
that I just don’t think about it. I’d be curious to see the data on
how people use these features. But if it’s not the default, you really
can’t depend on people using that product.  And if it’s a social media
consumption feature, then as a producer or advertiser, you probably
can’t query that in an API either.  Which would only be mildly useful,
depending on what usage patterns were available via API.</p>

<p>So yeh, I’m a bit bitter about my social media experience.  It’s not
rainbows and unicorns.  It’d be nice to feel “connected” I guess.  Or
at least for my online social life to fill in that void left by
constant moves and depression. Then again, I don’t think I want to be
glued to it either.  But I feel like “I did something wrong,” when
really, people are probably just too click-happy with that hide
button or something.  I donno.</p>

<p>Too much information is distracting.  I could watch coursera or math
lectures all day and never stop like it was my job.  I could just as
easily read articles on Twitter 24/7 and constantly find compelling
content to keep me reading.  Yet, I’ve reached this point where
there’s so much overlap between the knowledge I already have and the
information I’m consuming that it is a serious challenge to find the
valuable info that expands my knowledge or worldview.  There’s way too
much repetitive content out there: it’s a crowded market. It used to
be exciting for me to find articles to share on Facebook in 2010, but
now anything that’s important ends up in their Top Ten Trending list,
so it’s basically pointless to share news articles – again, I think
I’m “doing it wrong.”</p>

<p>But you’re basically prompting your friends with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey! Do you want to read this thing that you probably already read
somewhere else? If you haven’t read it, you probably already spent
all the time you had available to read boring news articles about
world politics or economics. But I thought I’d ask. Maybe click
“like” anyways?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeh… I’m not great with social media. That should be clear.</p>

<h2 id="networking-math-and-design">Networking: Math and Design</h2>

<p>In the next post on networking, I’ll describe ideas behind the design
of your IRL Social Network, as well as detail the math behind it.
There is a ton of math that’s involved in social situations, though
it’s mostly based on set theory and statistics.</p>

<p>For example, the center of the table is the best place to sit, if you
want to engage with a maximum number of people.  If you want to
restrict the number of people who can engage with you, then sit at
either end of the table.  Or go King Arthur and build a round table,
so everyone is equidistant.  That’s really the way to go.</p>

<p>More math: the ideal time to talk to girls at a show? If you’re
actually planning on having a good first night with her/them?  It’s
precisely 12 O’Clock.  As in, the first time you see that girl in
front of you, before she has a chance to consciously think about you.
That’s the statistic optimum for maximal first impression.  It’s
proven.</p>

<p>Also, the math behind designing and tapping into your social network
involves much of the same stuff found in computer science.  There
should exist some optimal branching design for a social network that
balances access to upstream nodes with influence or value for each
node.  This is moreso true with power structures found in corporate or
governmental organizations. Additionally, you can rearrange and
transform social network graphs to alternate representations with
layouts that satisfy some functional objective.</p>

<p>In designing the social network you want to create, there are several
maxim that are often repeated.  There’s the famous rule of a realistic
maximum of 150 connections.  Another that I’d like to discuss is they
saying that “you are the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time
with.”  This speaks volumes about optimizing the design of your social
network to benefit you and the people you spend the most time with.</p>
