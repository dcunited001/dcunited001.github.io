<p>Carbon dioxide is mostly meaningless in itself. However, CO2 does
serve as vital ecological metric informing us on the general degree of
pollution. It’s a red herring and a kind of a straw man. Pollution is
the real problem, with downstream effects on biological systems, which
are hierarchical, interdependent and incredibly fragile. As such,
pollition will exhibit strong second-order and third-order impacts on
global agriculture markets already strained by overpopulation. For
example, ocean acidification strongly influences the amount of food
that can be harvested from the oceans. There is a point-of-no-return
for ocean acidification, beyond which it may be impossible for nature
to recover.</p>

<p>Our world does not need to deal with billions of hungry people,
i.e. agricultural collapse. Instead humanity needs to ensure every
last person on the planet is fully enabled to contribute their maximum
potential because we need every one. With optimal contribution of net
human potential, overpopulation doesn’t burden us. It instead empowers
us to reach our full potential.</p>

<h3 id="climate-change-policy-drives-global-economic-trendsclimate-change-policy-drives-global-economic-trends"><a href="#climate-change-policy-drives-global-economic-trends">Climate Change Policy Drives Global Economic Trends</a></h3>

<p>Climate change and especially its international policy implementations
will drive economic trends in the world. It’s nerve-racking for true
conservatives, as these are supply &amp; demand dynamics <em>based</em> on
government policy and bureaucracy. The resulting dynamics are based on
the collective agreement that, however helpful or well-intended, that
these activities will continue to provide economic value to
industry. Thus, the cynical recognize this as unwise or at least
precarious. As the collective policy consensus wavers, so do the
actual/expected value and investment returns of specific
renewables. This consensus strongly influences the incentivization
factors driving supply &amp; demand. As that consensus waivers, all of
those products dramatically readjust in perceived value.</p>

<p>This is a bubble in renewables, albeit not in the traditional
sense. These dynamics drive a dissonance between real/actual value for
markets connected to climate change. This dissonance is retained
insofar as certain apprehensions are maintained by international
policy. These suppositions of how policy should be implemented
originate with the best intentions, but are sometimes misguided and
can’t be known to be permanent, looking forward. These policies
contribute greatly to economic opportunity – they are beneficial in
many ways – but entreprenuers should approach them under the
assumption that their value may be erratically dependent on some
arbitrary mechanism of international law. Therefore, any entrepreneur
should be wary, as their their business entity, city or nation state
have little control over these dynamics depending on international
policy whims. Since there is undeniable momentum towards renewables
and green practices across the world, this will inevitably happen, but
its handling by policy-makers dramatically affects the order and
quality of trends that emerge.</p>

<p>With few options for efficient risk assessment and effective risk
mitigation available to entrepreneurs, international globalist cabals
can use green policy to influence dynamics of the global economy
towards the application of some large-scale strategy. That is: there
is money and lots of it to be had if some group can steer global
climate policy. However, the main driving forces behind climate change
are not financial, but global industry leaders need to be roped into
conversations on climate change policy because without them, nothing
will realistically improve and there is significantly greater risk of
detrimental economic effects.</p>

<p>Resource consumption analytics powered by the smart grid empower
insights including quantified sociocultural behaviors, quantified
clusterings of behavior types, and automated psychosocial analyses
behind those behavior types. These data-powered insights will become
not just possible, but norms. This degree of quantifiable behavior and
its level of pervasion throughout life creates a paradigm shift that
is like a nightmare scenario for the SEC. We might actually be able to
“wrap-around” from automated signals on human behavior all the way to
finanacial indicators to reach a point where no stock price is
unpredictable beyond a tiny threshold of uncertainty. These financial
indicaters include such as stock price or anticipated trade
volume. Data empowered by smart grid analytics will offer insight into
financial trends unparalleled by social media signals.</p>

<h3 id="on-tax-funded-pollution-cleanupon-tax-funded-pollution-cleanup"><a href="#on-tax-funded-pollution-cleanup">On Tax-Funded Pollution Cleanup</a></h3>

<p>There’s an opportunity for monetization of pollution cleanup to which
the same corporations who profited off pollution are advantageously
postured to profit from the clean up. Those who profited off the
creation of these problems should not be the ones draining the tax
coffers getting rich cleaning them up. A framework for producing data
feeds on global pollution signals from sensors sounds like a great
startup idea.</p>

<p>There should be lots of opportunity for business here. Unfortunately,
there aren’t many ways to naturally incentivize pollution cleanup. It
must be financed through government programs, but as such, it is
dependent on growth elsewhere in the economy. Therefore, pollution
cleanup is always a net drain on the economy.</p>

<p>Honestly, it doesn’t matter who profits, as long as metrics on
pollution continually improve <em>and we stop contributing to it</em>. So if
the allure of tax dollars entices corporations to action, this is
invaluable in the quest of justice for Mother Nature.</p>

<p>From a pragmatists perspective that exerts sway over industry leaders
and conservatives, pollution is ultimately a problem because of the
unpredictable response of nature that tends to exacerbate comorbid
economic problems. If there’s one thing that business leaders love,
it’s being able to count tomorrow’s money today and beyond an
acceptable threshold, unpredictability causes more headaches and
misappropriated investment then the pennies shaved contributing to
pollution. These leaders speak the language of finance, economics and
ethical stewardship of their investments. If you authentically frame
the debate around those aspects of climate change, you win.</p>

<p><a name="climate-change-encourages-cooperation"></a></p>

<h3 id="climate-change-encourages-cooperationclimate-change-encourages-cooperation"><a href="#climate-change-encourages-cooperation">Climate Change Encourages Cooperation</a></h3>

<p>In which ways does climate change contribute towards cooperation and
thus stability? It contributes to economic planning and anticipation
of demand through faster/immediate feedback loops and high quality
data on patterns of consumption, especially energy consumption.
Developed states can market their products to contribute to
development of nations, connecting them to global markets. At this
point, a global framework begins to coalesce, which provides resource
consumption analytics. This framework layered on top of smart-grid
consumption data provides a fabric of metrics to measure usage/purpose
and is essential for accurate assessment of carbon tax offsets.
Demand from developing and recently developed nations increases the
aggregate demand for high-tech products towards its maximum, where the
aggregate demand for these products is highest when penetration of
development of nations is complete. Conversely, need/risk for
destablization of populations becomes balanced with the an economic
need for stability.</p>

<p>Through balanced trade, parties tend to stabalize each other via a
economic &amp; political framework for incentivization and mutually
beneficial partnership. This economically incentivizes peace and
stability, which provides counterbalance to other stress points around
the world. This ameliorates potential issues through cooperation and
deincentivizes conflict by providing the entire system with net gain
through stability and deviation from maximum economic utility during
times of conflict.</p>

<h3 id="warning-about-finance-and-international-climate-change-policywarning-about-finance-and-international-climate-change-policy"><a href="#warning-about-finance-and-international-climate-change-policy">Warning About Finance and International Climate Change Policy</a></h3>

<p>Conservatives are rightfully skeptical of manmade institutions created
to strongly dictate international norms for the purpose of some
abstract ideals. This generally confers the power to determine global
economic trends related to mission of the institution. Often, this
delegates US authority to some institution outside US control. Nowhere
is there more capacity for second and third order effects to commerce
and society than climate change and energy policy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore: step one, control the policy; step two, anticipate
resulting trends and place bets; step three, profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For every sufficiently large financial change to some stock, commodity
or derivative, there are ideal trading tactics. The capacity for
profit increases with the size of the asset change. The timing of
these large liquidity fluxes can be influenced by restraining,
accelerating and anticipating climate policy changes both large and
small.</p>

<p>Libertarians are distrustful of such artificial and inessential
international institutions. Such policy enacts mechanisms expending
real resources as costs, but add value according only to transient,
manipulable beliefs. This is similar to how people’s belief systems
can be manipulated to perceive wealth in the midst of what is only a
credit bubble. However, in the case of green climate regulation, the
bubble extends to influence all aspects of production and consumption,
instead of simply the macroeconomic mechanisms used to accelerate
finance of industry.</p>

<h3 id="carbon-tax-augments-the-global-economys-mechanisms-for-stabilizationcarbon-tax-augments-the-global-economys-mechanisms-for-stabilization"><a href="#carbon-tax-augments-the-global-economys-mechanisms-for-stabilization">Carbon Tax Augments the Global Economy’s Mechanisms for Stabilization</a></h3>

<p>Carbon policy augments the avenues for stability and circuits for
capital flux in the global economy. Yet, it’s not the only policy
needed to help ensure consistent opportunities for commerce and
finance across the globe. Via mechanisms enumerated in the Paris
Accord, states with space, but insufficient industry, could instead
leverage carbon offsets as a means for producton in economies where
other options aren’t present.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, I’m a conservative who believes climate change policy isn’t all
that bad for the global economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, island nations with large swaths of shallow/placid CZ
(Contiguous Zone) and EEZ (Extended Economic Zone) can use the space
to produce energy or reduce carbon. As will be shown in further in
this series, some of these states are ideal for facilitating space
commerce. If the world decides to set up such an artificial
international institution to regulate carbon, developing states begin
to develop faster and this will generally drive demand for tech
products, which should fuel economic growth the world over. The
economics of renewables and smart-grid products are interdependent, as
each establishes a platform that adds value to other. After a
threshold of infrastructure, a network-effect accelerates demand for
both renewables and smart-grid products, rapidly increasing consumer
adoption rates.</p>

<p>These mechanisms like those of the Paris Accord augment the global
economy with a mechanism for liquidity displacement and therefore
augment stability. However, these mechanisms for commerce are
precariously artificial and highly dependent on trends and specific
events in the realm of international policy.</p>

<h3 id="circuits-for-liquidity-flux-in-the-global-economycircuits-for-liquidity-flux-in-the-global-economy"><a href="#circuits-for-liquidity-flux-in-the-global-economy">Circuits for Liquidity Flux in the Global Economy</a></h3>

<p>In finance and macroeconomics, the integral of liquidity displacement
over time for corporations and states is an important measure of the
total displacement and movement of capital. Therefore, if one wants to
make money, one must observe global economic trends to identify and
predict major liquidity displacements. Smart short-term investments
will tend to accumulate slices of profit from each such movement.
That is, every time a large sum of captial changes hands, one can
alter their asset purchasing tactics to slowly appreciate small slices
of those transactions.</p>

<h4 id="x2605-with-the-right-ideas">★ With the right ideas</h4>

<h4 id="x2605-with-the-right-money">★ With the right money</h4>

<p>It’s all about accumulating strips of liquidity from major liquidity
displacements. Simply observe the integral of liquidity movements
between major nodes in the graph of economic players and various
aggregates of this: boom, money, and lots of it.</p>

<p>Taking a systems theory approach, these potential connections for
capital exchange are like circuits, through which is established
natural, balance-restoring feedback loops via potential global
economic liquidity/wealth transfers. Neighborhoods of the global
economy with low capital flux are at higher risk of precipitating
negative economic status, with fewer options for amelioration. These
neighborhoods, localities in the geographic sense and in the sense of
graph theory, would benefit more from additional mechanisms for
capital flux than regions already sufficiently <em>connected</em>. In context
of taking care to provide economic stability during dramatic
technology shifts, quantifying the connectedness of small
neighborhoods across the global economy is incredibly important for a
responsible approach to economic policy.</p>

<p>For neighborhoods in the graph of the global economy with low capital
flux, in addition to increasing capacity/propensity for capital flux,
we should focus on moving capital into the hands of more
people. Incredibly important for global economic stability, more
circuits whereby liquidity redistributions can rediverted capital back
into the hands of people. If one pictures a liquidity flux or capital
displacement in the global economy as wealth shifting from one group
to another, then one can zoom out and picture higher-order liquidity
flux from groups of nodes to others.</p>

<p>In a healthy economy, the rate of capital flux is high, but these
transactions don’t leave nodes with low capitalization. However, an
economy with a significant amount of wealth in a small group of people
can respond in more agile ways to economic crisis, whereas the wealth
would tend to be squandered in the same crisis if it were distributed
too evently. Socialists, especially in America, tend to forget that no
economy is an island and leverage the negative aspects of democracy to
unwisely short-circuit economy policy in the pursuit of making things
“feel” better. It’s a trap that has played out countless times in
history: the people sieze power, but don’t understand the trials and
lessons of their purged leaders with generations of experience. Thus,
what results is leadership woefully unprepared for the harsh reality
of a global economy.</p>

<p>One can use data science to obtain metrics from an economies tendency
to fairly redistribute wealth into the hands of many. These metrics
could be used to inform investment behavior changes that help fairly
redistribute wealth in a natural way that doesn’t involve government
regulation and bureaucracy. It would instead inform investors in how
money should be invested to help create an economy that fosters
prosperity for everyone. This is because, now, we can get much better
feedback through data science on how the economy benefits the common
person. And if it doesn’t, we know that something has to change and it
becomes trivial to demonstrate this.</p>

<p>The point is to avoid forcible redistribution of wealth. Instead, we
should architect systems whereby everyone is empowered and wealth
naturally redistributes itself. Ideally this will result in an global
population is essentially equivalently invested in the global
economy. We all must be equivalently invested in technology.</p>

<p><strong>Ultimately, what people want to know is: am I going to have a
future, how is my pension going to cover my retirement, what are my
options in the pursuit of happiness and will my family feed and
shelter my children tomorrow?</strong> This is what qualitatively matters to
people and, in the context of the economy, they might not understand,
but that’s what they care about. Start taking these things from people
or undermining their expectation of them and people get angry
fast. And rightfully so. Responsible stewardship of wealth is
incredibly important.</p>

<p>Carbon tax provides insights into global economic trends, by
leveraging the smart grid to help humanity understand how people
consume resources, qualitatively and quantitatively. Everyone across
the globe should be on the same page with this, so we can all empower
ourselves with this insight.</p>

<p>Further, this is where the money is in the smart grid and in green
tech. These metrics all depend on the features and level of data,
integration and global product penetration. Therefore, policy should
universalize the framework for smart-grid appliance &amp; infrastructure
metrics, so that everyone benefits.  The more various qualities are
optimized for metrics, the greater the degree of value that is added
to society as a whole, but this value is maximized when everyone is on
the same page. Business is about having a set of assumptions about the
world that can deliver profit if one acts on them. If policy
determines a consistent framework, then other products can more easily
add value on top of that framework, but those products depend on the
assumption that the framework supports the product. Therefore, an
inconsistent framework leads to consistent churn in the
competitiveness of viable products, undermining those assumptions that
are so valuable to entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>By donning a perspective enhanced by game theory, one can see that
climate change is an issue that can only be solved by getting all
nations on board. The larger the nation, the more important it is they
be on board and remain committed to restraining elements of their
economy for environmental conservation. For developing climate change
policy, the most important nations today are the US, China, India and
Germany, upon which consensus can be built.</p>

<p>Knowing that green policies acting to restrain climate change require
the entire world on board to be successful makes the power conferred
to these international institutions all the more precarious. With the
whole world’s weight behind an international institution equipped with
what is essentially the power to tax, survey and regulate
international commerce, libertarians and true conservatives know to
fear this all the more. Commerce is everything and the power to
control commerce is the power to control everything. Extend this power
worldwide and you’ll begin to understand why conservatives might be
nervous: they traditionally hold American sovereignty higher than any
international institution.</p>

<p>Combined with the ability to conduct climate-policy-fueled insider
trading, it’s no wonder that conservatives are hesitant to move
forward. Globally moving forward on this policy confers the
international leftist order the ability to micromanage economies from
the comfort of obscure international institutions. Enable this and
watch in wonderment as western economies collapse in controlled
demolitions. Just watch and remind yourself that you “saved the
planet” every time you see another economic crisis like Athens,
Greece.</p>

<h4 id="a-warning-to-liberals-inspired-by-pragmatism">A Warning to Liberals, Inspired By Pragmatism</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>With our powers combined … we summoned a slow, painful demolition
of western economies. Ironically, we’re now living in third-world
nation status and hating every minute of it. But hey, we saved the
planet, didn’t we? Or did we…?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps greater than the power to influence economies through
international climate policy is the power to compel nations to
disclose information about their economic activities. Yes, the Paris
Agreement is implemented as a protocol, which means that member
nations simply need to conform to specific reporting requirements
without necessarily exposing their internal specifics via a global
reporting mechanism. However, this means that each member nation’s
independence and competitiveness becomes limited. To understand the
specific mechanics of the Paris Agreement, it’s crucial to actually
read it, regardless of your leanings on the issue of climate. The
Paris Agreement or something like it is inevitable, but actual
discussion of the specifics is crucial, as a framework established by
the likes of Paris cannot so easily be undone once it gains
momentum. Shoving our heads in the ground like ostritches isn’t going
to help anyone. That’s a warning that applies equally to the right and
the left.</p>

<p>Further, this international autherity for taxation, quantification and
regulation of commerce represents the possibility of transition
towards a centerpiece for true global one-world government. As such,
it should thoroughly scrutinized by everyone. As a potential mechanism
for transition to one-world government, it is lunacy for conservatives
to remain uninvolved. Imagine if it’s actually an intermediate step in
transition towards one-world government and conservatives remained
completely uninvolved…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, I’d like to mention that I have the ability to unite
both the left and right to a degree exhibited and unseen by anyone
else on the planet. I imagine a better world, where Americans on the
left and right cooperate to make America great again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The potential for abuse is unreal. The data on resource utilization
and demand is incredibly valuable for both reading and driving
trends. It’s impossible for people on the left and right to not have
considered this. Still, it seems to be left out of the mainstream
discussion. This is a matter of sovereignty and enormous ethical risk.</p>

<h3 id="water-irrigation-and-desalinizationwater-irrigation-and-desalinization"><a href="#water-irrigation-and-desalinization">Water, Irrigation and Desalinization</a></h3>

<p>Massive engineering efforts to terraform land will become necessary to
support the population of earth. Water will become the new oil and
there isn’t nearly enough of it. Aquifers around the world are already
strained and we’ll need massive engineering projects to provide fresh
water for crops and settlements. LA is running out of freshwater.</p>

<p>Fresh water requires irrigation, which comes from meltwater,
groundwater and rain: there is a finite amount of this, actually.
Seawater must be desalinized first, otherwise it can render land
inarable, so that constrains valid designs for terraforming projects.
As large centralized drains on energy, desalinization projects will
tend to be powered with renewables. Desalinization will tend to lower
sea levels, which <em>could raise</em> the proportion of pollutants to sea
water, unless its not enough to counter the increase from melting
polar ice.</p>

<p>Interestingly, one can map the anticipated effect of freshwater
availability. If you look at the differential in water consumption as
a proportion of underground freshwater reserves remaining, you’ll
identify markets who will need renewable-powered desalinization in
order to produce local food, etc. So you can anticipate where these
projects will be needed, how badly they’ll need them and when. One can
anticipate slight increases in aggregate to the cost of living in
specific areas because of changes in freshwater requirements.
Therefore, you can anticipate this component’s magnitude in relation
to real estate price changes over time for specific areas.</p>
