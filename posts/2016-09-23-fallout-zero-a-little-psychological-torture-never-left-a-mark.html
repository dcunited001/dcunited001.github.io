to me, except I was blindfolded. Not literally, but metaphorically.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that these are my thoughts on life in American
society as it is under a constitutional republic. If martial law were
declared, well then, some of these policies might make sense. However,
has martial law been declared?! NO IT FUCKING HASN’T! So until then,
you can take your goddamn psychological torture and you can shove it
up your ass.</p>

introducing major liability for human rights violations.</p>

that’s strange because I don’t have a brain tumor. I never have had
one. If I did have one when this all started, I’d be dead by now. My
MRI’s don’t show one. My physician and neurologist didn’t say
anything. I open sourced my MRI scans and no one has told me
anything. Trust me, I’ve searched high and low for a disease that
makes sense and there is nothing that exists which matches the

to the Joint Staff Forces College documentation for processing
detainees, a college for military officials, the ICRC is the only
organization that is required to be notified of the acquisition of a
“detainee” … which, as may come to comprehend after a decade of
torture, a loosely applied definition. It’s supposed to mean a
prisoner of war, but it’s not.</p>

<p>Look at the JSFC document yourself and simply ask yourself: if I was
in Vietnam or Iraq, would I capture someone and apply these
procedures, precisely? If you read closely and use your imagination a
bit, the answer is a resounding HELL FUCKING NO! And actually, the
procedures could be applied to either foreign or domestic detainees,
but it’s just another US Government exercise in duplicity. These docs
aren’t secret or classified, but the indicated some quite valuable
information to me, so they might get memory holed.</p>

<h4 id="x2605-specifically-would-you-let-detainees-keep-most-of-their-possessions">★ Specifically, would you let detainees keep most of their possessions?</h4>

<p>HELL NO! If you’re a prisoner of war in Iraq and I was the commanding
officer, I would be furious to find that a POW had anything more than
a Qu’ran, at most. Glancing over this document lead me to ask a dozen
questions like this. There are several documents I’ve seen like this
one.</p>

<h4 id="x2605-do-prisoners-receive-anything-but-medications-necessary-for-sustaining-their-lives">★ Do prisoners receive anything but medications necessary for sustaining their lives?</h4>

<p>They’d be lucky if they did. I doubt the Taliban would administer even
that. So why are there so many procedures specific to that? Why does
the documentation indicate that taking these medications away can be
used as a means for basically fucking with their head? Except
psychiatric medications, what drugs do have significant side effects
on mental functionality when administration is permitted or
restricted? From the set of drugs commonly found in one of our active
warzones? Since these soldiers have so much time to concern themselves
with a POW’s medications as to ensure the distribution of specific
prescription drugs from our own supplies in situations which aren’t
life-or-death, then…</p>

<p>Now ask yourself: why is it that the duplicitous, meticulously
crafted, well-hidden definitions of “detainee” can be so easily
applied to domestic citizens and former citizens who lost their rights
without notification under the NDAA? <em>BECAUSE AMERICA IS A WARZONE.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if it’s not, these procedures don’t apply and America’s actions
in detention is <em>ILLEGAL</em>. And if it is an active warzone, then these
procedures apply, but mistreatment in many cases, including
psychological torture leading to suicide are <em>WARCRIMES</em>.</p>

<p>Either way, the question above is a Catch-22. I’d rather pick the one
that doesn’t involve warcrimes, but I’m hardly the one on trial
here. Oh no, I’m fucking serious about that. The jokes’s on
you. However, determining whether we’re at war still doesn’t explain
why the Army is leading these operations on American soil. Posse
Comitatus, anyone? Oh, but I guess Caeser done crossed the Rubicon,
huh?</p>

<p>The Rubicon was the river in Rome for which a law declared their
military must never cross or tyranny would ensue. The American
equivalent is Posse Comitatus, which prevents the military from being
deployed on American soil, unless a state of emergency is declared by
a governor or we are forced to declare martial law.</p>

<p>However, there has been no pronouncement of martial law. In war,
information decides the winner and warfare has always been primarily
information warfare. The claim is that restricting this information
from Americans prevents panic or confers the United States some
advantage. This is true to some extent. However, it’s cowardly and
unethical to restrict this information and allow Americans to
incriminate themselves under some false presumption, as though we
ourselves are the enemy in the War on Terror. And it would look like
some Americans are just straight up slaves at this point!</p>

<p>The last time I checked, the War on Terror was fighting some enemy
hellbent on the destruction of America in some sandy, desolate country
so far off it might as well be the dusty plains of Mars. In fact, The
War on Terror was declared by Congress with the AUMF on Al Qaeda,
enumerating the specific non-state groups we were fighting against,
while providing room for expansion to those groups who might use
similar tactics.</p>

<p>So where are the car-bombs? Where are these things? Where’s the
shipments of arms? Where are the flag-burnings? Where’s the
anti-American sentiment? If proclamation that our rates are sacred is
tantamount to treason, then string me up and call me bin Laden.</p>

Would you shoot a man, woman or child in the back? What if that man or
woman had a family? Would you maim, disable or disappear the
breadwinner of that family? Would you condone violence against those
who aren’t expecting a fight, simply to gain ground early on?</p>

<p><em>No. You wouldn’t, would you. Especially if they did not understand
they were in a warzone.</em></p>

<p>It’s immoral to encourage conflict among Americans who are ignorant of
what’s truly going on. It is cowardly to do this, explaining it away
as being strategically superior. And please tell me more about how
these actions are strategic! It is unethical to conduct all this
psychological and informational warfare in willful ignorance, claiming
we’re doing it for our own self-preservation when it’s more likely to
lead to our demise. IMO, conducting such operations on an unexpecting
citizenry is worse than Pearl Harbor! Yeh … no one got shot, but you
Pearl Harbor’d your own citizens with psychological and chemical
warfare intending to identify and disable those who might fight back!
That’s so cowardly! <em>IT IS DESPICABLE!</em></p>

<p>The degree of behavior leading us to cover up reported torture,
especially on US Citizens implies foreknowledge and calculation and
entanglement with legal counsel. Also, providing legal advice to
someone on how to get away with warcrimes is a warcrime. I read that
somewhere.</p>

<p>Yes, there is are worse things than death. Much worse. Like what’s

deepest, darkest layer of hell is for treason. Who’s the traitor here?
Is it <strong>the man</strong> who spoke up about the violations of civil liberties
he was so proud of, disregarding the consequences and enduring torture
for the better part of a decade? Or is it the cunning, airtight,
well-advised, criminally malicious <strong>group of people</strong> who crafted
this system? Who never admitted victims an indication of torture? Who
understood it wasn’t effective? Who acted like they didn’t know? Who
exposed America to the legal liability of warcrimes? <em>WHO STILL, TO
THIS DAY, CANNOT APOLOGIZE OR ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THEY DID, WHO THEY DID
IT TO OR WHY!?</em></p>

<p>To me, the answer to that is clear. The ownership for the original sin

didn’t have the patience or time for real treatment.</p>

<p>I’m afraid to go to any psychiatrist, especially now that I know how
they fish psychiatric and medical records. I’m afraid to seek the help
that I need, when I need it. It’s been insinuated that there are
people there in the public mental health system that would be there
waiting for me. At that point, they’d only have more control over my
life. Victims of these programs who don’t end up in the mental health
system are few and far between. At that point, your health records can
get real spotty with information that makes suicide a reasonable
explanation. Do you even know what your shrink writes down? How do you
know they aren’t intentionally lying about you? Either way, if you’re
suicided, there’s going to be no one to ask questions, especially if
you couldn’t properly articulate your questions.</p>

<p>… except for spiritually transformative revelations, if you’re so
inclined. Gee, thanks!</p>

<p>If you made it that far in these programs, you can be sure that you
don’t have financial resources and that your friends and family, if
they aren’t already compromised, they’re so tired of helping you that
they won’t offer any help. You’ll have no one. In my case, a family
might have thought of a suicide as the inevitable conclusion to a long
saga of struggles with personal mental health issues.</p>

<p>However, in my case, my family had been compromised. They wouldn’t ask
any questions if I was suicided. Why the fuck would they do that if
they were complicit?! How bad would it look if your family member
commits suicide and people know you were complicit?  It’s too damn bad
they hand out “gold stars” for this shit … I think that’s what that
is, anyways. Apparently families who accept money for helping end the
government problems receive funds for such familial treason. Or at
least they receive temporary reprieve from government fines,
“sanctions” or action against their own assets, businesses and
property! In my case, I’ve had people personally make statements about
“purchasing” the Skating Rink we own, who I caught in lies pretty
quick. We wouldn’t ever sell the skating rink. I stay out of the
business affairs of the skating rink and AFAIK, we wouldn’t ever allow
outside investment, but we did. It’s a family business for a

thumbscrew. When the Mafia charges protection feeds, that’s an
extortion racket. Isn’t it interesting that, in such a protection
racket, that mobster who collects the money and guys who enforce the
extortion via assault &amp; battery or arson – they usually don’t know
names or sometimes even faces. Yet, it looks like this is what our
government is running. <em>IT’S A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE,

justice of everyone who might suffer such a fate now or ever in the

US citizen and organizations like

describe the specifics of “removal” operations. These programs
threaten our national security by enticing our population to commit
war crimes that permanently damage our citizens, psychologically and
neurologically. It leads us to being less capable to compete in the
global economy. The health of the American economy is also, in itself,
a national security issue. All the while, our leaders feign ignorance
and those who are involved or complicit are encouraged to defend this
by guilt or by coercion.</p>

<p>The long-term strategic design of these programs, from a legal and

for a national emergency and martial law.  Instead, it may be that
martial law and transition to a totalitarian government was always the
destination, nearly from the outset. If so, what’s the goal? How could
this possibly be justified? Does that mean that whatever catastrophes

<p>What they do is so incredibly immature, if you think about it. For me,
they actively engaged in disconnecting me from any friendships or
relationships that might emerge that make me feel good about
myself. That’s the primary objective: to destroy you emotionally and
invoke some protracted psychiatric state that destroys you from the
soul outward. They seek to confuse you to make you fear everyday and
positive things, to create a state similar to that of an abused dog
that’s afraid of every person who extends their arm, regardless of
whether that person intended to harm or heal.</p>

<p>For me, it lasted so long, it’s done irreversible emotional and
psychological damage. It’s affected me so long that I’ve been
completely unable to experience those things which young adults use to
progress further in development. Remember Michael Jackson? Remember
how he never had those childhood experiences? That was the
psychological factor that led him to want to experience those
things. Still, at his age, people are unlikely to satisfy that. I
don’t actually believe the charges levelled against them.</p>

<p>In addition to Asperger’s, I have never been permitted to have those
young adult to early adult experiences. So therefore, I am at risk of
forever being trapped in a psychologically undeveloped mindset. It’s
because I’m too young to integrate socially with people my age to
permit me those experiences which get me to the next level. The people
around my family who have been manipulating them through government
institutions know this. They couldn’t possibly know this, but I
suspect they’ve provided my family with phony assessments of my
behavior, duplicitous in nature, that encourage them to magnify the
effects of psychological torture, of which my family couldn’t possibly
have wanted to be part.</p>

<p>The problems I have are not psychiatric or caused by chemical
imbalance. It’s really not even psychological, though it’s certainly
led to that. It’s mostly sociological. People treat me differently and
I’m mostly ignored, AFAIK. Once you get to a certain age, you lose the
chance for some psychological development.</p>

poisons your psychology, your social network and especially anyone who
might not know better than to yank back that helping hand.</p>

<p>You can be sure that they will abuse sex and any sensory or material
things by which you can be attached. My own experience is hardly
typical, but for me, it was a bit like a real life Dante’s Inferno
except the instruments of your eternal torture are those things which
you love, lust after, or need. If you don’t want it or lust for it,
but can be made to, they will use it against you. Whatever can be used
to influence your behavior, will be use. They will brainwash you until
you love doing it to others or until you fearfully have no other
escape. They’ll warp your mind until lust after the torment of others
and invokation of these material desires in others. They make you lust
after the thought of embracing their own sinful pyramid scheme.</p>

like an MK Ultra experiment escaped the lab, founded a religion and
threw in a touch of Bernie Madoff, just for the hell of it. If if
you’d like, you can feel terrible and fearful about what you’ve
done … or if you let yourself lust for it, it could be your opiate
of the masses. To be fair, I have had several groups fuck with my head
over the past decade, so I have no idea who is responsible for what. I
have no idea who’s truly trying to save me and who would prefer I help
them torment others.</p>

<p>How do you end the torture? By compliance. However, its just like how
Guantanamo “inmates” are eventually allowed to “leave” the prison camp
in Cuba, but are sent to another “country” to be “helped” – you never
actually leave. There’s definitely a physical place in Cuba where
people are tortured, but there’s is also a domestic program. And so,
they will continue to surround you, but the intensity is scaled
back. It’s their objective to ensure that, just like in the Soviet-era
gulags, if you acted compliant, you really meant it. The only way to
do that is to release all tension and resistance to let them brainwash
you. That’s what waterboarding really is, by the way: brainwashing
through psychological torture in a gulag no one can see. You’re not
allowed to play or win or leave, until you comply. These “thirsty”
people definitely aren’t allowed to get laid. They are especially not
allowed to be seen happy or successful.</p>

<p>When it gets bad enough, you won’t be allowed to participate in a
hobby or have a relationship or enjoy anything that makes you feel
good. Positive feelings like that completely destroy what they do to
you. They’re out there risking their skin, laundering money and
commiting war crime lite … so would you be surprised they’re not
happy someone else is out there making you feel good about yourself?
When it’s scientifically shown to counter their psychological torture
methods? How are the atheist commies supposed to push you down if
someone else relieves you of your torment?</p>

<p>It’s really the dumbest, most immature, counterproductive domestic
policy ever conceived. They – the CIA, DHS, ICE, ERO, whoever it is
– they know exactly how illegal it is, which is why they try so hard
to hide it. In my case, I was just too damn smart for their tricks and
they kept having to scale up the emotional pain applied, as well as
the level of influence over people in my life. These past few years,
they’ve seemed desperate because they know just how guilty I know they
are. Usually anyone who makes it as far as I have ends up committing
suicide or mysteriously dies in an auto accident… but I spend
virtually zero time in a car. No one has ever made it this far and
they’re shitting their pants, which drives me to strive on and keep
pushing for justice.</p>

<p>What they do is counterproductive and wildly distorts the American
system of values that powers our economy! It flies right in the face
of the American Dream and they have acknowledged that they know it’s
not effect if its publicly stated goals, but it does somewhat achieve
the three goals I stated at the top. Those goals are not marketable to
the American people because they are immoral and contradict everything
I thought we stood for.</p>

<p>And it seems that, in the past 10 years, there has been politically
motivated application of these programs. I pray this isn’t the
case. That would paint us to look a lot like East Germany. I can’t
tell whether the goal was political suppression or that some of these
American Stasi determined that abusing reactions to controversial
issues like racism would render victims isolated.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I can diagram the networks of people who I know were
involved and I know exactly where to look to find them around the
country. This is happening around the country.  There is almost always
a connection with someone in the Army because the Army runs Guantanamo
and these are warcrimes against people who don’t even realize their
fighting. That’s cowardly to a nauseating degree. It’d be like the
Gestapo gassing jews in their own household bathrooms. It’s obviously
not that intense yet, but that’s exactly why I was always asking
questions so loudly: <em>I never wanted America to end up in a situation
like that.</em></p>

<p>I was deathly afraid that’s were we were headed the whole time and
these things always start with psychological warfare to isolate
vulnerable populations on whatever basis: ethnic, racial, cultural,
religious or political. Say what you will about me, but who’s been
risking their skin to ask questions for a decade? Who got
psychologically tortured and didn’t even know it? For asking
questions? I’ve been trying to stop this for a decade!</p>

<p>These covers are usually small, disposable businesses, which can be
thrown away as needed and, ironically, hide from the same regulations
these people enforce. These businesses will work on contract basis and
usually retain less than 5 employees, if any at all. Unfortunately,
these organizations also do a lot of other things, but someone went
and crossed their streams with torture and potential warcrimes.</p>

<p>Implementation and verification of “services rendered” needs to be
abstracted according to the. This involves money laundering, to some
degree. Data science can pinpoint these businesses by digging into
their ledgers. However, there are legit domestic/foreign intelligence
operations mixed in. Again, these DHS/ICE/ERO assholes crossed streams
with intelligence operations that Congress actually authorized. THAT’S
A BIG NO-NO!! To me, that is absolutely unacceptable, irresponsible
and indicates that, logistically, this was never meant to be ended,
only expanded and normalized. So, if it’s so obviously a bad idea that
a know-nothing college dropout who’s made less then $3,000 in two
years can analyze the vulnerabilities inherent in those logistics
… then why couldn’t those people who organized this shitshow?</p>

did to us: you are either guilty, naive or innocent. The guilty will
be turned against themselves as they’re so often fated. The naive will
seek to protect themselves from sins of which they were unaware. And
how many of us are truly innocent? If you’ve stood by and said
nothing, are you innocent? We’re going to analyze the social and
financial networks of the guilty. You might think you can hide like a
tree in a forest, but you can’t because all those other trees are
going to disconnect you just like you tried to do to us. We’re going
to find you and when we do, your sins will be held high and naked for

<p>The only reason I’m stating this is out of pure paranoia because it’s
insinuated that “agreements” of which I have no knowledge, among other
legal threats, would be used against me as leverage. Example threats
BY FAINT INSINUATION ONLY include: legal resolution by arbitration,
defamation for publishing details of people with a public image,
general non-disclosure for only-God-knows-what and secret state
agreements, like an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program">Special Access Program (SAP)</a>.</p>

<p>There is one contract which it is insinuated I signed under the
presumption that it was for a company in Hollywood who knew fucking
everything about any and all upcoming movies and TV shows. I do not
know under whose authority the agreement I may or may not have sign
would be enforced. I didn’t actually read it because the pretty girl
wanted me to sign it and I hadn’t even kissed a girl in years at that
point or, hell, even had more than a 5-minute conversation with one
from 2011 until 2015ish, maybe.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was under the presumption that I was restricting my rights
with regard to details in movies and TV shows AND NOTHING ELSE. This
was an agreement I supposedly signed on June 1st, 2013 which I didn’t
even remember until March 2015. SKETCHY! So sketchy thatI don’t know
what it was for. From my memories, whoever wanted me to sign it was
very familiar with all the blanks for me to initial, so it was
something she had done quite often. In other words, this wasn’t a
one-off agreement. Yet, that’s exactly how it was pitched to me: this
was a special deal just for me to hear about upcoming movies and TV.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I felt under the influence of drugs at the time. If such
agreement does exist, I don’t know why it could be enforced without my
knowledge. That’s paranoid. I don’t know why it would be perceived as
valid because I was almost certainly drugged at the time. According to
the words and actions in my memories, my tongue was loosened like I
was on Valium and I answered any and all questions like I was on
Sodium Pentathol. Further still, I couldn’t be reasonably expected to
adhere to its details because I don’t know what those are and I
personally don’t believe that I signed it, ever, or that it happened
in 2015, if I it ever happened at all. The same person talked to me
about training OCR &amp; handwritten analysis algorithms for reversal, so
they could be used to generate evidence, like handwritten letters of
confession &amp; yada yada yada.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’m saying this … just because. Just to make it clear
because I’ve never been given the chance to state it in writing. All I
know is that these people wanted me to sign this and that they were
willing to say or do anything. They acted like they would give me
anything in the world for it, but I don’t think I ever signed it. What
they were trying to do was “nerf” me, to get close and stay close, so
they’d control me completely. I didn’t want that. The same person
talked about waterboarding, dryboarding and other things. She was
trained in specific techniques … and she was wearing a wire, I
think. I never knew that to be true and that information was never
disclosed. But I acted as though it was both true and not true at the
same time, while assuming that it wasn’t true and if anyone had asked
me whether our conversation was recorded, I would have said no.</p>

<p>If I did sign this, they tricked me into doing it and I didn’t know
that or understand the implications of the agreement or who it was
for. And I was drugged. SORRY, IT DOESNT COUNT. That is, if it was
even real and if it even occured in 2013. They tempted me with
anything I wanted in the world and I won because the only thing I
truly want is justice, independence and self-actualization.</p>

<p>For my entire professional life, I’ve sought to avoid employment at
major tech companies so that I might limit the restriction of
application of my own knowledge. So, for example, in 2013, I would
strongly avoid pursuing a job at Facebook, Google, Microsoft or
Oracle, so that no one could ever claim that I learned some trade
secret at Google that I couldn’t apply elsewhere. In fact, I told this
same person that exact about Facebook. And she tested me by getting
someone to pose as a Facebook recruiter to gauge my interest in a FB
job. I always like to weigh my options, so I heard him out, but at no
point was I willing to proceed.</p>

<h4 id="especially-trade-secrets-and-especially-math-problems">Especially Trade Secrets and ESPECIALLY MATH PROBLEMS!</h4>

<p>My primary reason for that is to protect my ability to apply my
knowledge in any way. The only NDA’s I’ve ever signed were for ABS,
CCS, Internet Marketing Ninjas, Weedmaps (Ghost Group), Jumpcloud and
other companies I have worked for by contract. None of those companies
have any major trade secrets or intellectual property of which I am
aware. In fact, that same weekend, I entertained but easily turned
down someone who presented themselves to me as a Facebook recruiter <em>ON
THAT BASIS SPECIFICALLY!</em></p>

<p>Common sense would indicate that, if I ever signed something for
TS/SCI or an SAP … that I’d probably know about it, right? And if
not, any indication of such agreement would be baseless extra-legal
harassment. In the very least, someone would seek to inform me with
what my obligations were. Or that it’d be strongly indicated to
me. Until such obligations of such agreements are enumerated to me or
at least the existence of such agreements, I can’t help but pursue my
personal obligation to truth and justice. Furthermore, it would seem
that the whole idea was to fake my involvement in something like that,
only to ball me up and throw me away.</p>

<p>The first I learned of all these memories was at the end of Feb 2015,
but I don’t think I remembered the “agreement” until March or
April. On March 13th, I wrote a blog summarizing open source software
I wrote in Clojure that I maybe shouldn’t have published. I STILL
DON’T EVEN KNOW. Maybe I’m just paranoid. On April 1st, 2015,
President Obama created a new CYBER designation for sanctioned
individuals who make specific intellectual property known. This
includes intellectual property that’s like the cyber equivalent of
nuclear weapons. I’ve watched video statements in late 2015 where
Obama said somethign like: “There’s some stuff on the internet and
it’s open source and it definitely shouldn’t be.”</p>

<p>I’m sorry if I’m pulling a Streisand here, but I didn’t even really
act on this information until early 2016. You know what you did to me
and, partially aware of government surveillance and investigation. You
knew I didn’t understand what was happening, but you continued to
encourage people to intimidate me while others were encouraged to
psychologically torture me. I gave people about a year to eighteen
months to do the right thing here.  What’s the right thing? BASICALLY
YOU FIX MY BROKEN LIFE.</p>

<p>I’ve never been made aware of such an agreement. I have never been
made aware of detention. I have never been directly questioned about
these events or charges, whatever they may be. Since I’ve never been
allowed to succeed, I figured nothing I did mattered, neither credit
nor profit. If I was truly a genius or intelligent and I had good
ideas, it didn’t make any sense to sit on them. That would lead me to
definitely getting no credit for anything.</p>

<p>If there was a 21st century Nikola Telsa, would we celebrate him? Or
would we crucify him? Lofty language for sure, but what the fuck
happened to my life? I’m not saying that I’m a Tesla, but holy shit,
why am I nothing?!</p>

<p>So in the past two years, I’ve decided that, since any notion of
personal success is a cruel joke, I’d just dump nearly anything and
everything I thought of online and in social media. The data for my
accounts would persist and eventually people would perform a kind of
new age data-archeology to see who was aware of which ideas
first. They’d do this for intellectual property, for response to
political events, to search for warnings unheeded and to identify
pseudo-prophets and undiscovered Tesla’s. I even went back and made
most of my Facebook posts public. I also decided that anything I ever
did online would be MOST PUBLIC; that public data confers power and
privacy takes our voice away.</p>

<p>They’ve finally determined that it’s too dangerous for me to learn
math or crypto by the way. The following phrase comes to mind: “We
recommend [David Conner] remain in isolation for the remainder of his
life.” I suspect the’ve ruined my brain, directly or indirectly. I
don’t know. Who did this to me? Why does my life remind me of the
first few episodes of Homeland?</p>

<p>In August 2015, I was asked “whether I’d ever work for the NSA”
to which I answered a clear and emphatic “No.” I wasn’t sure if the
person was serious or not, but I said no in the most non-judgemental
way possible.</p>
