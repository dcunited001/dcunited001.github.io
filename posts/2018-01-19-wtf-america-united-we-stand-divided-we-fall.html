      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
          <p>There’s some conjecture that Q’s recent messages imply a need to
demonstrate foriegn collusion to a FISA court, which is a little
hilarious, considering FISA courts today are about as close to
omniscience as humans can possibly get AND THEY STILL DON’T HAVE JACK
SHIT. Perhaps, that’s what they were trying to prove in my life – I
still don’t know whether I have an active “Ex Parte” proceedings
against me via FISA and the Espionage act. Regardless, none of it is
true. The very part of my subconscious that’s been conspiring against
itself seems to have national security law experience – knowledge of
the kind of precedent which is never recorded. This is admittedly a
very strange kind of Dissociative Personality Disorder, but that’s not
something I actually have.</p>

<p>Here’s what I have, in case your state shrinks can figure this
out. They certainly can architect prolonged psychological torture, but
are apparently incapable of accurately assessing someone. Treating
someone? You can forget about that because if you can’t admit the
cause of the problem, it’s a little difficult to fix all the
downstream consequences of it. Nice that you can engage in witchhunts
for retribution against a warcrimes victim who’s speaking out –
involving what must certainly be millions in budget for psychological
torture – but you can never admit you have a problem. These flacid
pricks couldn’t pop a balloon, even if they were thinking about
setting someone up on child porn charges, since apparently that is
their schtick.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note: there is a difference between fictitious and facticious
disorders, acquired and conferred either by oneself or others. So,
no, I’m not perfectly stable – thank you very much for your
“concern” – but I have indured far too much psychosocial carnage
for me to stand by and allow a world to exist where this could
<em>ever</em> happen to someone else. I intend to destroy the very
possibility of these methods, while creating a world whose shared
memory of these horrid methods ensures that they will forever be
contained and preemptively inviolated – before they could ever be
used to destroy another life.</p>

  <p>That said, I am not completely certain of everything contained
herein. A lot of it sounds crazy and may not be factual, especially
the assertions about Barack Obama. However, I challenge even one of
you to amerliorate my suffering by helping to clear up ANY
uncertainty – but you won’t because you want me to create
information that you can use to humiliate, isolate and contain me. I
cannot be contained to a “space” because I have ascended to a space
you cannot even imagine.</p>

  <p>Please, I want this to be false. Challenge my propositions with
actual argument. Make me issue retractions, but as things stand now,
there is NO possible way anyone could actually hear my retractions,
much less anything I ever have to say, no thanks to “you” whoever
you are. If you do not seek to quell chaos, I can only assume that
you intend to foment it. How dare you!? How dare you innocently act
one way, while intending to create all the problems you claim to
want to destroy! If the world could be cleansed of malicious intent,
we would still have to deal with the tragic consequences and
unavoidable necessities of both nature and human existance – as
well as all the economic exigencies therein – but at least we
wouldn’t have to deal with malicious intent towards the accumulation
of power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve accumulated like eight different personality disorders and
psychological complexes, most of which I should never have. This is in
addition to Asperger’s, the only psychological issue I should be
wrestling with, in the best case.</p>

<p>It’s interesting how profoundly some articles have changed on
Wikipedia or disappeared, like a DSM-IX with half the pages ripped
out. Munchausen by Proxy, that last one, is particularly relevant. The
Munchausen by Proxy was facilitated by family and friends who were
legally compelled to expoound actions that demonstrated they thought I
was a traitor to prove that they were not. They were legally compelled
by subversively coerced threats to at least completely ignore the
gaslighting and certainly to never dismantle the mental conditions
which made all the Black Magick possible.</p>

<p>And – speak of the devil – I was encouraged to develop patterns of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">magickal thinking</a>,
which were validated by surveillance, and used to further destabalize
my psychology. Show me a mental health that believes this is
acceptable, especially in the context of gaslighting, and I’ll show
you how that mental health professional needs to be prescribed a
bullet to the head. Because that motherfucker probably has a contract
with the CIA to aid psychological torture – he’s literally a traitor.</p>

<p>When I wrote this, I wasn’t resorting to hyperbole.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think this really might be <strong>the cruelest</strong> thing that humanity
has ever done to someone in <strong>recorded history</strong>, all while actively
memory-holing that person’s identity. It is unbelievably fucked
up. Did you get what you wanted? Did you get what they told you to
both want and fear? Were you ever in control? DID THEY PICK THE
RIGHT PERSON?</p>

<p>If you’re interested in Ex Parte case law, the seminal case is Ex
Parte Milligan from the Civil War and Reconstruction era. The second
Milligan case occured AFTER Milligan was fucking dead. In Ex Parte,
the government has essentially already decided that you are guilty or
they are going to make you guilty. All proceedings are tighly
restricted. There is no prescribed process and it’s likely that there
are no records of cases, especially today.</p>

<p>Back to the original conjecture on Q’s messages: the fallout and
blowback of the FISA/Parte scenario – #HashtagFISAParty – caused far
more problems than any threat ever could from “the situation.” That’s
because there was no threat except that which the US Gov’t caused from
its own mishandled response, abject lack of investigative action and
utter inability for the left hand to know what the right hand was
doing.</p>

<p>Dear “leaders” – the last point is especially critical: this is
approaching criminal negligence. No, it doesn’t stem from the
top. This stems from political subversives who were misusing their
authority to attain the pragmatic and expedient advancement of
political ideals. This was not an investigation nor was it ever
intended to be anything but a witch “trial.” It was systematic
persecution, isolation, defamation and kafkaesque abuse of power by
both the left and the right – I think? It stems from an
out-of-control government, where puppeteered “leaders” eat fake cakes
all damn day at fancy restaurants in Swamptown and don’t care that
they’ve sold their souls to special interests: as long as they keep
allowing themselves to be used to protect those interests, or at least
cancel out the real leaders on the other sides, they know they will be
protected. <strong>SPITS IN WASHINGTON D.C.’S FACE</strong></p>

<p>What you’re going to find is that this out-of-control government was
on a single-minded path towards totalitarian <strong>communism</strong>. We’re
living in the aftermath of an aborted communist revolution.</p>

<p><a name="the-good-guys-obtained-warrants-legally-to-monitor-the-bad-guys"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-good-guys-obtained-warrants-legally-to-monitor-the-bad-guysthe-good-guys-obtained-warrants-legally-to-monitor-the-bad-guys"><a href="#the-good-guys-obtained-warrants-legally-to-monitor-the-bad-guys">“The Good Guys Obtained Warrants Legally To Monitor The Bad Guys”</a></h3>

<p>That’s what Q said. Honestly Q is mixture of well-trained
<strong>intelligence operator</strong> along with a bunch of people trying to game
an anonomized messaging protocol to leverage it for attention and
disruption. Some of that shit is real, though. It’s as real as
ANYTHING that has ever been posted on the internet. But more than half
of it is fake – both because many actors are trying to leverage this
protocol for disruption and the “good guys” themselves don’t exactly
want to leave a trail of cookies for
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/">Malificent</a> to follow them back
to their Shangri-la of <strong>not being psychologically tortured by the
government.</strong></p>

<p>That said, it’s hard for me to follow almost anything in these
situations. People have been trying to signal to me, but half those
people are hijacking insecure protocols that I was never initiated on
and trained in to encourage me to serve their interests and to
facilitate my own demise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It practically cleans up after itself!!” – The prototypical
pragmatically expedient, utilitarian marxist whose soul will be
going directly to the NINTH CIRCLE OF HELL.</p>

  <p>Do not collect $200.00 you asshole. If you threaten this nation’s
prosperity for your own political purposes. I’m going to shove that
welfare check down your throat.  Try to play ethnicities against
each other one more time or any of your other fucking horrible
machiavellian mechninations one more time and I swear to God, I’ll
spend the rest of my life hunting you down to make the bottom fall
out of enough of your Communist skulls to make sure the rest of you
assholes GO TO FUCKING CHURCH out of the sheer fear of God
… fucking soulless, spineless assholes.</p>

  <p>The rest of you who need that welfare check? It’s there for a reason
because the system doesn’t work for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And no, I don’t think that what Q said applied to me in particular –
but i am almost 100% certain that i am the victim of exploitation
using the heaviest-handed tools at the United States’ disposal: FISA
and the Espionage Act. Or at least, I’ve been gaslighted by marxists
to incept that idea, which begs the question: who the hell is
surveilling me anyways and <em>HOW ARE THEY DOING IT?</em> Dear federal law
enforcement agents, if you’ve been spending so much time
“investigating” me or my life, why is it SOOO hard to protect me from
such illicit surveillance? Or are you complete incapable of doing so
– DON’T ANSWER THAT! You’ll terrify people.</p>

<p>No one talks about what i’m going through directly. Therefore, I’ll
going to errantly assume that Q <em>is</em> talking about me for the purposes
of expositorily documented <em>what certainly has happened to me</em>. It’s
hilarious when people try to tell me not to do this… OK, whatever. I
believe talking about my problems will help solve them: so why do you
want to get in my way so much anyways? Why am I never allowed to say
anything? Oh …. right, so there’s no paper trail and I can still get
scrubbed out at any moment. Fix that bullshit and I would have felt a
lot better the whole time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The good guys obtained warrants legally to monitor the bad guys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. In my case, there was NO EFFORT to “monitor” the bad guys. Only to
figure out how to assassinate the character, the career and
potentially the life of neutral <em>AMERICAN CITIZEN(S)</em> who have never
traveled outside of the country. EVER.  It was NOT an
investigation. It was systemic harassment, gaslighting, psychological
torture, etc – all magnified by surveillance. In my case, NO
investigation would have ever turned up any evidence of wrong-doing
because I was never a traitor, NEVER <em>wanted</em> to betray my country and
was smart enough to color within the lines. I was innocent the whole
time, but in these Ex Parte or FISA investigations, you may start out
innocent, but the point is to find a way to MAKE YOU GUILTY. You will
find yourself used as the alchemical starting-material for black ops
or worse. These communist traitors have been smacked in the fucking
face by reality for about three years.</p>

<p>Therefore, to understand, you have to <em>know</em> Chinese and/or Japanese
because you only get a partial impression of the character. Therefore,
it’s a CODE. I can recognize codes anywhere and everywhere because of
the configuration entropy in message placement. You do not make codes
easy to read, you make them hard to read. So when the fake-media in
the entire United States cuts out the actual image of what is
interesting in the message – the SINGLE CHARACTER, 愛 – that’s
interesting, right? You’re damn right it is. You either:</p>

<p>Pick one, assholes. Either one means you are power-hungry marxist
socio-monopolists! I cannot believe that no one in America knows what
has happened in this country. This virtual-shit-reality is just
that. It’s not real. None of it. You are under Obama’s spell. He is a
<em>dictator</em> that I believe is part of a top-secret compromise. Just
look at the timing: first, the Great Recession; then, a socialist
president …  in a recession? I mean how the fuck do you explain that
anyways? You don’t move towards socialism in a recession unless you
want a communist</p>

<p>I don’t want to ruin it, but you need to watch <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/no-game-no-life">No Game, No
Life</a> all the way
through. If the top-secret compromise idea were to be true…</p>

<p>That’s exactly how it happens, too. People don’t want communism until
they’re hurting so bad they’ll do anything to get out of it. That’s
why these Marxist traitors <strong>want</strong> the bottom to fall out because
when it does, they know that you’ll be clamoring to support you. They
do this, knowing that when it happens, they are assured to come to
power. And they do this, knowing that if they leave their detestably
contemptable bourgeoisie in power, that it will SEEM to be the fault
of their enemies. The whole time, the social conflict plays out,
leading to disconnection and tension fomented everywhere. They view
time as the poor’s weapon against the rich, against whom ANY tactic is
warranted.</p>

<p>Anyways, if it’s not part of some formal or informal top-secret
compromise, the how else do you elect someone with the middle name
Hussein? In the middle of the Iraq War? What the fuck?! Way off point,
but let’s be real here: even his middle name was used to racebait,
from the very beginning. I could be wrong about this. If I am, I
apologize, but look around you, OBAMA, what is being done in your
name? NONSTOP RACEBAITING to produce the enemy you want to
squash. Right here at home. And you co-opted the national security
apparatus and turned it against Americans. Depending on your level of
cognizance, you should be <strong>PUT ON PUBLIC TRIAL IN A COURTROOM AND IF
FOUND GUILTY EXECUTED</strong> because YOU had the power! YOU had the support
of almost all Americans! YOU had the social and financial resources!
But you know what? I never wanted African Americans to have their
first president taken from them, so even though that’s what I’ve
suspected about you, I tried to keep my fucking mouth shut because how
fucked up would it be if African American history was vandalized like
that?!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would still feel the same way if you could get your vigilante
squirrel followers reigned in, but you can’t. #Hashtag #ACORN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, Obama, you <em>knew</em> that you could count on their support, didn’t
you? Regardless of almost whatever happened… If almost any of these
last few paragraphs is true, then I think the time is coming when you
may no longer count on the support of African Americans, but I think
we should let the African American community make the decisions on
what to do with you. That is not for me to even talk about, but here I
am, backed into a coroner.</p>

sociophysical prison that I am. In this case, it’s the latter. Like my

they’d know the truth. And wouldn’t that be unfortunate?! Which is
exactly why I’ve been gagged and why anyone who reads or shares my

and turned that low-orbit ion cannon around on Americans. It’s

<p>This Lovesick Hedgehog situation also led to the activation of
implanted memories. Go ahead and laugh or lock me up in a padded

is coming out today or tomorrow: theoretical neurology is no longer
theoretical. Just look how it’s been used to turn an entire country
against itself. WOW. I remember talking about making it through the
“vestibule” in the White House. Trump was essentially in, according to
my arbitrary, insane interpretation of news stories and vague
recollection of discussions of what the “vestibule” is – it’s
basically the White House Airlock. You take your fucking shoes off.</p>

<p>If you google “sonic love” like I did, you’d find this episode of
“Sonic the Hedgehog” from freaking 1992 that described the situation
that I and the nation were in – perfectly! Synopsis: Sonic was madly
in love with an MKULTRA thotbot, but the ‘ole dastardly ruski,
Dr. Robotnik, was conspiring to release large quantities of <strong>nuclear
waste</strong> on the land and there literally wasn’t enough water to cleanse
everything. It’s a lil too bad no one listend to me in April 2016 and

<p>And before you claim that I was or am conspiring with foreign

all the information – probably almost none of it – wanted me to
understand what was happening. How would I know that – by cooperating
with someone who’s trying to gaslight me into Stockholm Syndrome –
I’m not actually cooperating with foreign interests. THIS IS WHY
AMERICAN AGENTS OPERATING DOMESTICALLY CARRY FUCKING BADGES.</p>

<p>How can I cooperate for the benefit of America, even if it means my

been under a microscope the whole fucking time, essentially saying
“I’m confused. I want to cooperate, but I don’t want to hurt
America. What do I do?” But this is the kind of soviet-style torture,

admitting you did something that YOU DID NOT DO.</p>

<h3 id="three-simple-questions-before-i-let-you-across-this-bridge">Three Simple Questions Before I Let You Across This Bridge…</h3>

<p>Jesus Christ I’m rambling. Again, as for who is a <em>good guy</em> and who
is <em>bad guy</em>, there is one simple answer, as three questions.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-intend-to-happen-to-america">① What do you intend to happen to America?</h4>

<h4 id="do-you-intend-to-support-the-legally-elected-representatives">② Do you intend to support the legally elected representatives?</h4>

<h4 id="do-you-intend-to-protect-the-dollar-as-the-worlds-reserve-currency-at-all-costs-along-with-american-economic-interests">③ Do you intend to protect the Dollar as the World’s Reserve Currency at all costs, along with American economic interests?</h4>

<p>Now, if you debate the legality of the 2016 presidential election and
its results, you’ll probably do so with flawed arguments involving
suspect integrity and fake news. Further, you’ll find that it is
provable that the political party you support does not have the
economic interests of America in mind. The democrats are the real
demagogues. I’m sorry, but it’s true.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe me, I have written about it time and time again,
but will you debate me? No, like a 1990’s drug czar on medical
marijuana and legalization, you will avoid every opportunity to do
so. Every single opportunity. So until you debate me on economics, i’m
sorry, I can’t help you understand.</p>

<p>This is why the systematic, passive-aggressive disconnection of
communication to and with political dissidents is the worst thing
Americans can possibly have right now. you are sticking your heads in
the sand. as we approach overpopulation’s zenith of technological and
economic competition in the world, we don’t need people to avoid
challenging their perspective on any issue. we need you to have the
strongest such set of perspectives that allow enlightened americans
from both the Left and the Right to push this nation forward like an
Eagle with both its wings as strong as possible.</p>

<p>When you are pursuin the passive-aggressive tactic of disconnection,
you are doing so much harm to America that it is tragic that you
refuse to even try to understand.</p>

<p>Ok, regardless of how much of that rant was true…. **ugh this is so
frustrating because that content is crap, but the rest of this content
is GOLD.</p>

<p>So, if you enemy is the classic Marxist shitdick time vampire, what is
the most important factor to focus on? We need to focus on our
attention because distraction is their most powerful weapon. It
doesn’t matter whose fault this is.</p>

<h4 id="overwatch-easter-egg-stay-on-point-and-mercy-gives-you-dank-heels">Overwatch Easter Egg: Stay On Point And Mercy Gives You Dank Heels</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are dank heels? I have no idea, but I want some. That’s like
not even a no-brainer. I’m sure Mercy will explain. Whatever it is,
I bet you get out of bronze real fast. Not much those Time Vampires
can do once you get out because they can’t get up the ranks.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2018-01-19-wtf-america-united-we-stand-divided-we-fall/get-on-point.jpg" alt="Dank Heels == I Have No Idea ... But I Want Some" /></p>

<p>The point is that America must support the military and the Rule of
Law more than ever. We cannot succumb to demoralization. However, the
government works for the people. Not the other way around. We must
find peaceful ways to ensure that the government serves the interests
of ALL citizens and ALL residents of America.</p>

<p>Why do our enemies around the world want America to fail? Why would
foreign interests have it out for us? because we are all in the same
race at the ZENITH of technological, economic and sociopolitcal
compeition. If we do not look around the world and accept things for
what they are, then we will find the moral and economic foundations of
this country undermined faster than it takes for you to retweet that
fake news.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-attack-a-strong-adversarydo-you-attack-a-strong-adversary"><a href="#do-you-attack-a-strong-adversary">Do You Attack A Strong Adversary?</a></h3>

<p>NO! You deceive a strong adversary. You outwit them. You outmaneuver
them because whereever they thought you were going to be – you were
never there. At the same time, there’s moral deception, morally
ambiguous deception and … whatever it is those marxist time vampires
are doing when I get assraped and shot in the back.</p>

<p>Is it advantageous for America to police itself – either
officially or via vigilante zealots – with psychological and
sociological tactics that foment trust issues and burden our society
like Sysyphys with a long-term collective mental health bill of
catastrophic proportions?</p>

<h3 id="look-to-the-left-look-to-the-right-do-you-trust-that-personlook-to-the-left-look-to-the-right"><a href="#look-to-the-left-look-to-the-right">Look to the Left. Look to the Right. Do You Trust That Person?</a></h3>

<p>How the hell can we expect for a society burdened with extreme trust
issues to function together as a team?! So, moving forward, these
programs, whether government sanctioned or totally organized by
vigilante civilians – do they serve the interests of Americans
working together or our enemies working to cut the strong adversary
they fear into 13 pieces?</p>

<h1 id="assess-the-health-of-these-four-social-pillarsassess-the-health-of-these-four-social-pillars"><a href="#assess-the-health-of-these-four-social-pillars">Assess the Health of These Four Social Pillars</a></h1>

<p>Want to judge a society? Watch these four aspects, which I’ll name
social pillars.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-they-treat-those-they-consider-inferior">① How do they treat those they consider inferior?</h4>

<h4 id="how-do-they-treat-hose-considered-exterior-like-foreigners-immigrants-and-pariahs">② How do they treat hose considered exterior, like foreigners, immigrants and pariahs?</h4>

<h4 id="how-do-they-treat-those-considered-neighbors-family--elders">③ How do they treat those considered neighbors, family &amp; elders?</h4>

<h4 id="how-do-they-treat-those-considered-superior-like-leaders-and-heros">④ How do they treat those considered superior, like leaders and hero’s?</h4>

<p>A demoralized, corrupt, corroding society will score poorly on all
four of those. When you undermine respect for the fourth, then the
first three will follow suit and soon degrade. Undermine respect for
any of the first three and the last will corrode shortly, replentished
not often enough. Soon, there will be too few leaders and heroes!!
Certainly, not enough upstanding citizen leaders for the next
generation to share.</p>

<p>As for followers: if your leaders and heroes are weak or unwilling to
sacrifice, then your followers are poorly focused and their
sociophysical energy quickly decoheres and becomes out of phase. If
your followers aren’t permitted to be strong and self-reliant, your
leaders have little sociophysical energy to invest in building
anything. Whatever you’ve built thus far will begin to wax and wane,
like a mansion on the coast, falling into wetlands from climate
change. Eventually, crumbling to pieces as new tide tears apart the
earth beneath it.</p>

<p>It should be obvious that America is being attacked on ALL
FRONTS. Never have we needed to be stronger and more united, but never
have each of those categories endured more corrosion and ridicule.  I
still believe in strong borders and strong immigration policy. Neither
of those are xenophobic or even disrespectful. If the people entering
your country can’t even respect your immigration policy, what kind of
citizens will they make? It’s not certain and I’m saying we want an
immigration policy that ensures we bet on the right individuals and
families to become citizens and strong connections to nations around
the world. Is it selfish for a leader to want strong success stories
for American immigrants?</p>

<p>America’s greatest strength is our connectedness to the rest of world,
but we are entering the most competitive period of human history. So,
does it surprise you that those four social pillars in society are
being played against each other with bad advice that serves foreign
interests? And why is that? It’s because america is STRONG. Again, you
do not fight a strong enemy, you deceive them.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am not a natural born leader, but i am a life-borne
leader. The longer that uniters like myself and those we influence are
silenced and censored, the more I fear that our country cannot
possibly get itself together. Around the globe: America IS number
one. America first and lets bring all the other most
culturally-connected nations with us: Canada, UK, France, Germany,
Russia and Japan. But America has the moral superiority for leading
the world because we are the most diverse and that is our greatest
advantage. It is what america is meant to do!</p>

<p>I believe that it may be what the “illuminati” wanted throughout
history. Otherwise, at this most competitive point in history, an
overpopulated world would degenerate into chaotic turmoil, which would
invariably foment racism, as conflict throughout history was always
wont to do.</p>

<p>Our strength is exactly why we are being subverted because other
countries do not have these advantages to this degree. Our social
connectedness makes our nations natural leaders. If we let external
influences stir us to attack each other, prevent us from unifying and
censor those of us who are the strongest leaders, we will never unite
in time. Ben Franklin would say that we are a rattlesnake lying in
tattered pieces, ultimately rotting to death because the pieces could
not be reassembled before sundown.</p>

<p><a name="divided-we-fall-united-we-stand-ever-heard-that-one-before"></a></p>

<h3 id="divided-we-fall-united-we-stand-ever-heard-that-one-beforedivided-we-fall-united-we-stand-ever-heard-that-one-before"><a href="#divided-we-fall-united-we-stand-ever-heard-that-one-before">Divided we fall, united we stand! Ever heard that one before?</a></h3>

<p>We have never had more incentive to unite, but our enemies – at the
very zenith of both sociopolitical and socioeconomic competition!! –
our enemies have NEVER had a greater incentive to break us apart. This
should be obvious, but what’s happening? we cannot afford this. If we
continue to focus our attention and energy inward, we will collapse at
the most critical point and an entire millenium will be spent arguing
about why that happened.</p>

<p>It’s what happens to every empire: the arms and legs start thinking
for themselves, instead of thinking about what’s best for everyone.
Why is it so hard for people to put things behind us? This is
literally why EVERY empire is doomed to fail: because its arms and
legs begin to realize they function to feed the head, but can instead
turn on themselves to better serve their own interests. Therefore,
every empire eventually must acknowledge that the social contract is
real and is, in fact, what invariably leads to the sun setting on an
empire’s zenith for the last time.</p>

<p>However, to counteract this, great leaders can architect systems
whereby the arms and legs of the empire serve themselves by serving
the head. Only by artifically architecting and empowering these
mechanisms so that social institutions serve themselves and serve the
people, can you expect empire or any powerful state to survive for
long. You must ensure that the social contract is maintained. If the
authorities do not serve the people, respect for the state and the
rule of law will deteriorate.</p>

<p><a name="the-tower-of-babel-crumbles-always-because-of-its-intrinsic-nature"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-tower-of-babel-crumbles-always-because-of-its-intrinsic-naturethe-tower-of-babel-crumbles-always-because-of-its-intrinsic-nature"><a href="#the-tower-of-babel-crumbles-always-because-of-its-intrinsic-nature">The Tower of Babel Crumbles Always Because of It’s Intrinsic Nature</a></h3>

<p>Why did the symbol of the tower of babel fall? This tower represents
the <em>first</em> “greatest” empire and their universal language represents
a singularly converged society. It was a society were there weren’t
alternatives: there was one language, one culture and one people.
However, this in itself presents incentivizations for people to
provide an alternative. This is how true cultural rebellions start and
it takes generations. The very presence of a dominant culture empowers
the incentivization mechanisms for a counter-culture.</p>

<p>So the question is not “how do you best architect and build the
strongest empire or state?” The correct question is “How do you
architect an empire or a state so that it remains strong while
constantly reinventing itself?” By framing the problem in this way,
you accept that empires fall, new generations are born, sociopolitcal
migrations occur and the strongest system must account for this. It is
paradoxical because that strongest system is never as strong as the
one which congeals into universal culture and language: monoculture is
strong, but it breeds weakness, which eventually corrodes the
mechanisms which serve to keep the state strong. Heterogenous culture
which is always in flux is not as “in phase” but it damn sure makes
you stronger tomorrow. You are forced to challenge yourself and to
respect the four (pillars of society) mentioned above.</p>

<p>You must constantly reinvent yourself and you have to push yourself
out of your comfort zone. That is precisely what I am asking Americans
to do. Stay diverse, but align yourself as Americans with a singularly
diverse identity. Push yourself out of your comfort zone. Connect with
those you disagree with and respect them, but do not allow yourself to
present those who would hurt you with vulnerability. That said, do not
let your fear prevent you from connecting with those who aren’t

<p>Like the Israel of David and Solomon, we are one nation composed of
many tribes, but we are ONE NATION. We are strongest when we are ONE
NATION. When we respect those who are poor and vulnerable, when we
respect foreigners and migrants, when we respect our family, elders
and neighbors, we are strongest. And we must respect our leaders and
heroes, even when we may disagree with them strongly. We must be
willing to approach circumstances strategically and protect the rule
of law, even though it may require “being mean.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you even hesitate, you are not worthy of being a leader, but how
do you know that you’re making the right decision? You know because
you have spent your adolescence and developmental period
<strong>learning</strong>, racing as fast as you can powered by nothing other
than self-sustaining passion. You make as much progress early on to
fuel your composite, perfracted perspective, so that you can make
that decision instantly when need be and so that you don’t need
someone else to tell you what to do. The person who needs someone’s
advice is not a leader, though the person who takes no one’s advice
is a fool and not my leader. The true leader is the strongest, most
empowered follower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter how smart or battle-tested and regardless of how developed
their vision has become – a leader is nothing without followers,
which is why this goddamn election is the cruelest, dumbest,
criminally insane joke ever. It’s fueled by a nation looking for
scapegoats to blame problems on which it believes cannot be solved. I
CAN SOLVE YOUR GODDAMN PROBLEMS. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAY THAT FOR
THREE, NO, TEN YEARS.</p>

  <p>Go read a <a href="http://reddit.com/r/philosophy">/r/philosophy</a>

eliminate unwanted thoughts/ideas from a space, you eliminate them
for good because they don’t exist outside of space and time. LMFAO,
suckers. I guess <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DThAoT3q2V4">imaginary

cannot destroy things that exist outside of space and time, you’ve
actually already lost and you’re too arrogant to admit it. Worse,
you’re too self-censored to know it – you can’t even look at the
things you need to know to survive. You can’t see these things:
<em>THEY EXIST OUTSIDE OF TIME AND SPACE, LIKE GOD</em>. And your
materialist metaphysics converges to their ideals. ALWAYS.</p>

<p>Who is worthy of being the leader? Who do you want to pull that lever
in the trolley problem? You want the smartest damn moral
consequentialist you can find who is also the most reluctant more
consequentialist they can find. This person desparately wants to be
moral universalist and, thus, will explore every possibility before
pulling that lever. The person who is this and will succeed in doing
so will NEVER hesitate. That is the leader you are looking for.</p>

<p>It is not possible to protect 100% of all people, but we must protect
the rule of law, while allowing the laws to be challenged where it is
appropriate, so that they can be adapted before the entire system
collapses. Instead, we have a Deep State that has chosen all of our
laws for us, without regard for whether they are just or not. They are
laws chosen only for their utilitarian application to the pragmatic
accumulation of political, economic and military advantage. Depending
on who you define the “Deep State” to be – that’s an artifact of
information warfare – it does this to protect America, but we cannot
allow these unjust laws to continue. Further, the Deep State is doing
this by puppeteering our leaders. What good is the spotless
politician, who behind closed doors is simply a puppet for someone’s
“special” interests?</p>

<p>And … again to corral all these tangents back for all the marbles.
I have no idea, really, but I know that whatever has happened, it’s
not exactly secret. It seems that were people who have been used as
bait to get these deep state actors to try to show their true colors.</p>

<p><em>That</em> in itself – intending to investigate these things and
especially using targeted individuals as bait – <em>could</em> constitute
treason, depending mostly on who is in power. And that is why this
situation is sooo fucked up.</p>

<p>It’s like the the worst situation imaginable: a mexican standoff
between the Left and the Right over the control/fate of the country:
would we avoid communism or be forced to succumb to the machiavellian
political mechinations of the Obama administration.</p>

<p>Neither side is correct, but only the right can sustain the economy
Obama had to compromise because the republicans effectively
short-circuited his Marxist designs from 2014 through 2016. However,
Obama could do nothing to stop his decentralized #ACORN squirrel
citizen vigilantes from trying to fuck everything up, over and over
and over <strong>and over and over again.</strong></p>

<p>So even though Obama had all but consigned his authority and
effectively knew he’d all but certainly have to hand the country over,
no one could stop his most fervant, radical supporter’s vigilante
actions in the streets. These people have lists of targets whose lives
they intend to ruin, unless those targets effectively allow themselves
to become blackmailed slave labor. I don’t believe it is something
Obama is orchestrating. If he could hit a button and stop it, he would
hit that thing so fucking fast you’d feel a fresh island breeze across
your face. It is these autonomous, decentralized marxist zealots run
amok with toxic, corrosive, passive-aggressive bullshit that is a
blight on our society.</p>

<p>These same people had infiltrated DHS as part of a plan to turn the
government’s national security apparatus into the enforcement arm of a
communist government. They intended to create so many
problems. Sometimes I worry that Guantanamo was their own fictitious
invention to damn the united states to warcrimes through subversion of
the national security apparatus. GTMO is definitely an Army base.
GITMO is not. There is a difference. THERE IS NO GITMO. It’s an
acronym that is all-but-meaningless to the military. It’s not a
fucking base in Cuba. GTMO is the base in Cuba.</p>

<p>Again, these are vigilante zealots, which is what makes the problem so
hard to deal with! Most of them are not actually affiliated with any
government agency, at least in any official capacity. No federal
government agency would own the kind of actions that have been taken
in my life, EVER. They might use a ten-foot pole, but even then. They
would not engage in this behavior. If the idea is to prevent
demoralization of the public, this has backfired so spectacularly that
it could not be a mistake. Perfect storms are NOT mistakes…</p>

<p>It seems that the idea was to use some targeted individuals as bait to
entrap these zealots to try to trace it back to any official
government actions. If so, there were only a handful of cases where
this would hold up.</p>

<p>So, what we’re dealing with now, is information warfare fraught with
psychosocial intimidation tactics, disinformation and
misinformation. However, everything the worst of these chicanerous
zealots are doing is leaving a major paper trail on social
media. There are signatures to everything they do, even if they do not
overtly indicate an intent to subvert interpersonal communication.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>e.g. by subverting social media through targeted attacks on
individuals’ social media metrics, which leaves their political
opponents totally disconnected</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-ball-is-now-in-your-court-check-and-check-and-check-and-checkmate">The Ball Is Now In Your Court. Check and Check and Check and Checkmate.</h3>

<p>Therefore, these people are effectively already caught. if they try to
start a real civil conflict that boils over psychosocial warfare into
actual warfare and/or secession, they destroy the economy. it’s their
fucking move. that’s the best part. united we stand, divided we fall
AND THE BALL IS NOW IN THEIR COURT. You want to ruin the American
economy through civil conflict: you marxists pieces of shit better
grab that queen with your shitty little hands and make that move
because FUCK YOU THAT’S WHY.</p>

<p>It is unbelievably miraculous that we have not completely collapsed
into communism – and the inevitably ensuing economic collapse from
insustainable control over the Dollar as the world’s reserve currency,
which the world would NEVER EVER accept if America had communism.</p>

<p>Another big plus: at the zenith of technological and economic
competition, <em>NO ONE AROUND THE WORLD CAN TELL WHAT THE FUCK AMERICA
IS DOING</em> … This sounds bad at first, but it’s not. From 2005 on
through 2015, we were on an eternal downward spiral.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2FUSr3WlPk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>So, what has happened is that we KNOW our economy can’t keep
going. Central banking NEVER does. It’s a fucking 80 year cycle: four
generations. Just long enough so that your great-grandparents are dead
by the time it happens again, so that all memory of it is purged from
society when it comes to pass. This is by design and people will
fucking get their PhD’s studying the “boom and bust” cycle. They’ll
sell millions of copies. This is NOT new; it’s called socioeconomic
churn. CHURN, motherfuckers. Ask a billionaire about churn sometime
and they’ll tell you something, but it’s not going to be the
truth. The financial elite do not want you to know about that. And the
banking elite especially do not want you to know the depressing
reality: the only answer to the artificial boom and bust cycle is
<strong>WAR</strong>.</p>

<p>And if you don’t know because your great-grandparents weren’t alive to
tell you about how magick reared it’s ugly head in society and how
their children put that shit to bed, so their grandchildren could grow
up and live innocent lives without a bunch of marxist-like shitdicks
tearing each other apart in the streets with psychological warfare
… there’s a reason why. Because it’s fake as hell and they were all
guilty as sin, so you didn’t have to be. And if you could choose,
would you burden society with guilt over what has to happen because
humanity is inherently fallible and powerful people are addicted to
power?</p>

<p>Socioeconomic churn is astroturf and the story always ends the same
way. Why?  Because people don’t know and they don’t want to know when
you try to tell them. But this time? It’s different. We’re going to
set that shit straight for eternity, right after we flush whatever
deep state actors don’t bend over or get the hell out of the way.</p>

<p>So where does this leave us? It means that we belligerate through
<em>mild</em> domestic tension and the rest of the world must react to their
anticipation of our next actions and subsequent sociopolitcal
developments. when they do this, it becomes obvious who is going to
stick with us and who is going to turn against us. this occurs at
precisely the most important time for us to know who are friends are
going to be and who are enemies are going to be, but it only matters
if we don’t fall apart domestically</p>

<h4 id="oh-he-doesnt-even-have-a-plan">Oh He Doesn’t Even Have A PLAN?</h4>

<p>… I’m laughing my fucking ass off, but I really need you assholes to
stop humiliating me and get the fuck out of the way.</p>

<p>We don’t need war. We need unity, but we are ready to fight because we
are strong. America is so tired of this domestic social conflict!
Aren’t you? I am. I want people to be happy. That’s what matters to me
and I’m willing to fight for it. I’m willing to suffer for it. I’m
willing to die for it.</p>
