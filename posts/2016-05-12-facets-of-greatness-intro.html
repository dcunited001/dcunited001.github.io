of hardship?  What attributes contribute to the development of these
qualities and behaviors? Why are these attributes important?</p>

<p>What kinds of knowledge help us form and realize a vision? What
knowledge catalyzes the development of such a vision?  What inspires
others to work with us?  Here’s a list of what I believe to be the
Facets of Greatness.  In this article, I’ll summarize each of these,
providing detailed descriptions subsequent articles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And I really just want to emphasize that, while I’ve learned a lot
about these “facets of greatness”, I’m not exactly the
brightly-shining, radiant, exemplary apex here… I want nothing
other than to methodologize and improve on these, if I’m ever to
realistically expect to launch a product.” - David Conner, Radiant
Apex of Greatness…</p>

<h2 id="where-do-we-learn-to-be-greatwhere-do-we-learn-to-be-great"><a href="#where-do-we-learn-to-be-great">Where Do We Learn to be Great?</a></h2>

<p>Where is it that most people learn to be great?  It’s their father
that first imbues that image.  Perhaps their mother as well.
Unfortunately, I never had a father.  He died when I was 14 months
old.  You might say the world acted as my father, or tried to help as
much as it could anyway. So, instead of a singular impression or image
of what it means to be a great person, I ended up with several.  Yet,
the combination of these impressions were far weaker than that most
receive from their father.  So as I began my 3rd decade of life, I
found myself lacking direction and instead I felt a hole that needed
to be filled.  I was forced to search hard for meaning in life, but
there was nothing there, nothing real anyways.  I eventually found
that I needed to create my own meaning in life.</p>

<p>So this series is a reflection on what I’ve learned. I didn’t have
much of a clearly stated system given to me by my parents.  That is,
other than <strong>(Step 1)</strong> Read the Bible <strong>(Step 2)</strong> Go to Church
<strong>(Step 3)</strong> ???.</p>

<p>I had to create my own, which is by no means complete. And honestly,
building your life on a basis founded in even a small amount of
religious study is not a bad idea.  Religions are successful primarily
because they are so capable of providing people with a solid
foundation for life.  In addition to explaining the mysteries of life
and it’s origins, religions are the accumulation of stories, which
impart wisdom and a method for living life.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll describe other systems of virtues, detailing how
they differ from what I’ve included in this series, which is moreso
about the knowledge required to move people to build great
things. Then I’ll provide a summary of each facet, each of which will
be further detailed in future articles. Then I’ll describe some of the
general mistakes I’ve made in the past and explain why it’s important
to play to appearances. I’ll elaborate on some of the personal costs
of doing so.</p>

<p>I discuss why wealthy circumstance doesn’t always lead to success and
explain the kind of psychological natural selection that does seem to
lead to it.  Success and wealth seems to ironically detract and shield
us from the experiences that lead to stronger people. I’ll discuss
vulnerability and the paradox of how shielding our individual
vulnerabilities makes us weaker as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="aristotelian-ethics-a-brief-interlude"></a></p>

<h1 id="aristotelian-ethics-a-brief-interludearistotelian-ethics-a-brief-interlude-1"><a href="#aristotelian-ethics-a-brief-interlude">Aristotelian Ethics: A Brief Interlude</a></h1>

<p>Aristotle’s Ethics includes a system of virtues, which is highly
regarded.  It’s lasted over 2,000 years, so someone thought it was
important. Aristotle emphasizes the notion that the ideal practice of
a virtue was exemplified by finding the <em>mean</em> between two extremes
for that virtue.  It’s very interesting that Aristotle thought to take
something like virtues and human behavior and plot them onto something
that is like a space.  Each virtue is like a dimension or an axis on a
graph, where the extremes are found at the ends of each axis.  A
person exhibiting perfect ethical behavior would then find themselves
centered at the origin of these axes, although I’m not sure that a
notion of perfect ethical behavior actually exists.  Optimal ethical
behavior, in the Aristotelian sense, really depends on your intent and
your objective in life.  If there is an optimum, it should be found in
a region of space close to the origin.</p>

  <p>Please note: I haven’t studied this in any official capacity, so do
your own study and draw your own conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="magnanimity"></a></p>

<h2 id="magnanimitymagnanimity"><a href="#magnanimity">Magnanimity</a></h2>

<h4 id="aristotles-crowning-virtue">Aristotle’s Crowning Virtue</h4>

<p>Of particular importance is Aristotle’s concept of <strong>magnanimity</strong>,
which requires handling transgressions with grace, humility and
wisdom.  Someone magnanimous would be willing and eager to sacrifice
their own objectives towards the pursuit of something much
greater. Someone who is magnanimous knows what they believe and
understands how to exemplify their beliefs, which they do, almost to a
fault.  They have detached themselves and their ego from their
circumstances and their behavior is dictated by their ideals.  And
yet, they can deftly respond to ethical transgressions towards
themselves with graceful, agile, creative responses to negative
situations. A person like this must retain awareness of their
environment and must be capable of vetting those they will work
with. They must observe and identify the context in which their
actions will be read without utilizing such means as to alter the
context. At the same time, it is helpful to retain control over the
context of such situations, but most of us lack the resources or time
to do so. Magnanimity is a higher-level virtue, exemplified by
threading and layering practice of the other virtues.  It is
cultivated over the course of one’s lifetime and sometimes over the
course of generations. You can read more about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnanimity">magnanimity</a> on wikipedia.</p>

<p><a name="youre-not-born-with-virtue-or-magnanimity"></a></p>

<p>Another important takeaway is that no one exemplifies these
virtues <em>a priori</em>. It takes practice and conscious effort. There are
many paradoxical behaviors which depart from natural human urges and
one of the most important is that we must learn to enjoy that which is
not enjoyable, yet fosters development.  Delayed gratification, in
other words.  Basically, controlling your mind to extract pleasure
from situations and experiences which would be considered boring,
frustrating, or painful.  The degree to which one can do is one of the
primary factors that determines the degree to which they can develop
these virtues.</p>

<p>However, one conclusion that I’ve drawn from studying Ethics is that
the systems our society has in place to cultivate virtuous people who
work together – these systems are fairly fragile and must be
protected.  It really only takes a generation or two and it will all
fall apart.  We enjoy the benefits of a stable system with strong rule
of law, but there are a lot of people who don’t comprehend or don’t
care to understand how our systems work or why.</p>

<p>The relative stability we have and the democratic system we’ve set up
– it creates a very special environment in which those who are good
are rewarded, for the most part.  Even in countries which do not have
a strictly democratic system, some are experiencing unprecedented
growth because their systems cultivate the right virtues and promote
those who exemplify them.</p>

<p><a name="democracy-encourages-personal-investment"></a></p>

<h2 id="democracy-encourages-personal-investmentdemocracy-encourages-personal-investment"><a href="#democracy-encourages-personal-investment">Democracy Encourages Personal Investment</a></h2>

<p>The reason a democratic system works is because it
fosters the involvement of large proportions of a nation’s population.
The more people who are involved, the more invested citizens become
and the more difficult it is to obscure corruption or enshroud a
protected political class through various mechanisms. Successful,
stable governmental systems will always promote involvement of all
stripes of citizens, regardless of the mechanisms in place for
governance.</p>

<h2 id="why-power-should-gravitate-towards-senioritywhy-power-should-gravitate-towards-seniority"><a href="#why-power-should-gravitate-towards-seniority">Why Power Should Gravitate Towards Seniority</a></h2>

<p>And so, because the governmental and societal systems we have in place
are so special, yet can be fragile – and because these virtues
contribute to stability and the possibility of benevolent livelihoods
– then it’s important for those who exemplify the right virtues to
accrue influence. It’s often difficult for people from ages 15
through 30 in America to understand some policies because there are
some things you won’t understand until you’ve had specific life
experiences.  Plato famously wrote in The Republic that a society
should be governed by the older generation and this is why.</p>

<p><a name="wisdom-comes-from-experience"></a></p>

<h2 id="wisdom-comes-from-experiencewisdom-comes-from-experience"><a href="#wisdom-comes-from-experience">Wisdom Comes from Experience</a></h2>

<p>Some of these experiences include graduation from higher education or
disease or dealing with the reality of one’s own mortality or the
death of someone you were close to.  A great example is having and
raising children.  There are things you just won’t understand in life
until you personally have invested your love and life into raising a
child, watching them walk into many of the same phenomena of life that
you did. And so there are many policies or issues that won’t make
sense or won’t seem relevant or that you won’t prioritize until you
personally have that experience, whatever it is.</p>

<p>But one general idea behind wisely implemented policy is that those
who make the right decisions and those who are willing to risk and
sacrifice in pursuit of what they believe to be good, even when those
benefits may only pay off in the long term – it is incredibly
important to reward those people.  Often, the right thing to do isn’t
easy and there was an easier path, but for whatever reason, some
people chose the harder path, even when they thought it might not pay
off for a decade.  But this is also why it’s important to educate
those who don’t care or have a hard time comprehending why America
works and has worked for about 250 years.  And this is becoming a bit
harder to do, as the pace of information transmission accelerates and
it becomes harder to discern what we should believe and what we should
examine further.</p>

<p>As development of technology only expands more rapidly, this kind
of sociological changes will only become more commonplace.  This is
why it is urgent that we foster the kind of culture around the world
that is prepared to adapt. It’s also important to ensure that everyone
stays above water.</p>

<h2 id="poverty-is-corrosivepoverty-is-corrosive"><a href="#poverty-is-corrosive">Poverty Is Corrosive</a></h2>

<p>Poverty creates desolate conditions in far too many lives and poverty
itself disrupts propagating values to the next generation.  There is
far too much confirmation bias in both the rich and the poor that
prevents us from finding solutions to address the root causes of
poverty.  In particular, those who are wealthy have an obligation to
aid those who are not. If the wealthy do not demonstrate their
appreciation of that responsibility, then the system that we have
becomes reproachable and vulnerability to instability.  We absolutely
cannot have this kind of instability in any major world power as we
approach this period of exponential technological growth.</p>

<h2 id="technology-is-a-double-edged-swordtechnology-is-a-double-edged-sword"><a href="#technology-is-a-double-edged-sword">Technology is a Double-Edged Sword</a></h2>

<p>Technology is a double-edged sword and has the propensity for
beneficence and for malevolence, particularly if it’s not controlled.
If some of this tech gets into the wrong hands, it will create
disorder that is bad very every major world power.  If we recognize
this, agree to cooperate and formulate a strategy for handling this,
then we’ll be fine. If we can’t do that, we’re screwed.</p>

<p>And the kind of world that exists after major technological collapse
is one in which the lack of resources and the lack of systems to
promote coordinated behavior prevents the emergence of a stable system
that fosters virtuous behavior.  It’d be the exact opposite.  The best
way for an individual to survive or protect their family would be by
acting in horridly selfish ways.  It’s also important to understand
that this kind of Mad Max scenario isn’t certain and that assuming it
is may make it difficult to restore order.</p>

<p>The whole world has enough on our plate without major war. We have to
clean up the oceans and the environment over the next two generations.
That’s really all the time we have to fix certain problems, which IMO
is plenty of time, excluding major disaster. I’ve seen amazing
progress towards many difficult long-term issues in the past two and

<p>So anyways, what I’m writing is meant to equip my readers with tools
that will help us lead a new generation of cooperation. I think, I
can’t honestly say that this is everything or there aren’t other
leaders who are far more capable advice.  Or experience.</p>

<p><a name="with-no-small-plans"></a></p>

<p>Whereas Aristotle and Franklin’s writings were meant for life in
general, the Facets of Greatness series provides information meant to
help those with no small plans develop a vision and learn to live with
their future story in mind. I hope that some of this information will
help those with dreams learn to share their vision with others to
encourage cooperation.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time watching interviews and press conferences of
leaders and I hope this series captures much of the qualities the best
leaders exemplify and the tools they use.  These tools are often
difficult to see or only attained with experience. Most people, if
they understand them, have a very hard time explaining them.</p>

<p>And yes, this series is imperfect.  Yet even in a premature form, I
believe that some of these tools will be invaluable in whatever
app-designing or empire-building or world-saving pursuits you may
have. You may find your dreams to be more about building a small
business for a robust, enjoyable family life or working towards a life
long goal in academia.  Still you’ll find this series to be incredibly
useful, even if your megalomania isn’t quite yet terminal.</p>

<p>In this series, I’m trying to explain concepts that involve
characteristics which cannot really be explained at all. They are much
deeper than that.  And so, these facets are like the faces on the
surface of this abstract, ineffable thing.</p>

<p>I really hope that by explaining these facets, I make it easier for
others to relate to the intangible truth to becoming great which so
often eludes the majority of us.  Most give up on pursuing this path
before we know it exists and by the time we see it, it’s too
late. You’ll find in life that there are many people out there with
advice for you, but truly, their advice is meant to make you useful to
them, while providing enough value to seem authentic.</p>

<p>Instead, I hope to arm you with most of the knowledge and advice that
I would give myself.  A good rule of thumb for ethical action in any
case and especially when giving advice to someone is the golden rule:
treat your neighbor as you’d treat yourself.  Or, more radically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Treat everyone else as though they literally are you. As though we
are all one. That, by harming another, you are harming yourself.</p>

<p>And the Golden Rule’s corollary of course: treat yourself as you’d
like others to treat you.  I’ve said it time and time again. <strong>Your
confidence is your most valuable asset and you better know that people
will try to steal that too.</strong> By assaulting your confidence, you’ll
find that negative people not only boost theirs, but they do so at
your expense, by subjugating you through demoralization.  You’ve been

<p>In the intro, I’ve provided a quick summary of each facet.  I ended up
going well over what I’d planned for some of these summaries.  I’m
planning on writing a 3,000 - 10,000 word article for each facet and
I’ve mostly written out about half of these.  If you want to check out

<h2 id="x1f48e-quantificationquantification-1">💎 <a href="#quantification">Quantification</a></h2>

<p>Great people quantify and measure everything.  Without quantification,
you cannot develop a system or hope to improve.  The most difficult or
seemingly ineffable is usually the most valuable to form a system for
quantification.  Since it’s difficult, it confers advantage when you
can measure and predict that which mystifies others. It’s especially
crucial to learn how to measure your usage of time, as well as those
around you.  You also need to learn to quantify information,
knowledge, communication and social networking – both online and IRL.</p>

<p>These great leaders are all conductors in the symphony of
communication.  They identify the most efficient means to relay
messages, so that they can interface with a tree of people in their
own organization as well as with people in others.  Everyone has
twenty-four hours in a day.  The best leaders effectively communicate
with others who command their own subtree of the organization and, by
doing so, harness the sum of man-hours available to their network for
maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>Additionally, they know how to structure and build their social
network.  These leaders know how to maximize the efficiency of their
communication by coordinating with high-influence nodes in their
network.  They adapt their network by rearranging redundant nodes to
reduce inefficiencies.  Furthermore, you’ll find these people are
effective at identifying influential people inside and outside of
their network in order to cultivate those connections.</p>

<p>However, being the guy that only seeks out those who are useful in
some way is kind of shitty, so it’s important to be authentic, so you
don’t come of as a self-serving sycophant, obviously. Learning how to
reinforce your network through spontaneous connection and
communication is an artform.  If you only talk to someone when you
need something, it becomes obvious pretty fast, which can be
unfortunate for quiet people like myself.  Instead, if you gamify your
communications with others to force yourself to reconnect just to
catch up every few months or so, this can work wonders when you
actually do need something.</p>

<p>Additionally, effective networkers excel at quickly identifying the
power structure and relationships in an unfamiliar environment.  This
can be challenging since any patterns that arise from these structures
are often ephemeral – people’s behavior can change depending on who’s
in the room at that time.</p>

Leveraging your network with a concise message. Simple is better.</h4>

<p>Communication is one of the most important facets to develop.  If you
can’t communicate effectively, how can you expect to leverage your
network and coordinate the execution of a strategy?  It’s important to
be able to craft the same message in various formats, to optimize
various functional objectives. Examples include brevity, detail,
rhythm, adaptation for a specific medium, usage of specific
vocabulary, and more.</p>

<p>In general, minimalized content and a concentrated, focused message is
superior.  It’s tough to tumble and polish your message until it
conveys everything you need with concise precision, but it’s well
worth it.  A minimal message is efficient in terms of time and it’s
also easier to parse because there’s less to consume and process.
This increases it’s capacity for retention.  Twitter’s a great way to
practice, since you have to find a way to say everything in 140
characters.  If you’re building a product, you really need to figure
out how to succinctly summarize your product’s value, while
distinguishing it, in the span of a tweet.  If you can’t do that, you
haven’t spent enough time thinking about how to convey your product or
its value proposition to your customers.</p>

<p>It’s important to project a consistent message from and across your
organization.  This is a rule that’s made to be broken
… occasionally.  But it’s getting harder to maintain consistency
when there’s so much consumer engagement across social media. How do
you know that your social media presence is in step with your brand’s
image?  For large organizations, how do you ensure that the right hand
knows what the left hand is doing?</p>

<p>Your communication needs to cohere to any longer-term marketing
strategies you have in place.  You’ll need to reach niche markets.
These are valuable because of their diversity, but can become more
expensive to cater to.  You’ll want to target subgroups of consumers
with whom a particular style of message might resonate strongly, but
would turn off consumers from other subgroups.  And how do you
identify these groups in the first place.  Communication is a two-way
street.  It’s both conveying a message and processing messages from
others.  So your organization needs to be capable of identifying and
categorizing groups of people on social media, perhaps using
algorithms like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">cluster analysis</a>.
Proficiency here means effective, efficient market penetration and
hopefully stronger customer relationships.</p>

<p>Leaders also need to develop interpersonal communication skills, which
I definitely need to strengthen.  I enjoy watching founders discuss
their products and organizations in interviews, especially those
founders who are new to the game or have burning passion for an
exciting new idea.  I enjoy thinking about how this process works for
all parties: the founder, the interviewer, the hosting organization
and the audience.  It’s important to stay on message and there are a
lot of subtleties to watch out for, most of which are personal
mistakes.  It’s important to keep your customers and fans excited, but
also stay on message while retaining flexibility for any business
strategy. For publicly-traded companies, these objectives can be
difficult to balance with the interests stockholders.</p>

The how and why to signaling. Why signaling overcomplicates otherwise simple projects. How signaling is the missing piece for the otherwise exceptionally intelligent.</h4>

<p>Signaling is a kind of indirect communication, but it differs
significantly from that described above because it encompasses
handling unintentional communication.  Everything around you is part
of a myriad of systems, composed of countless feedback loops.
Signaling concerns becoming aware of how your organization’s words and
actions will implicitly and explicitly affect those feedback loops.
Mastering signaling requires development of self-awareness at multiple
levels beyond the individual.  Typically, you’ll find that these
leaders and corporations prefer to not signal at all, especially in
interpersonal communication. This is kind of because everyone knows
that all (or most) options are on the table, always.</p>

<p>So get to work on your poker face.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E.G. My startup says we’ll never IPO.  Everyone says that.  It’s a
fucking negotiation tactic.  Yet, it’s also just generally a good
idea to retain control, especially for a young, small startup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, here, the rookie move (in most circumstances) is to imply that
you’re willing to IPO or accept acquisition early on.  Even if you
say you’re not, everyone knows that for that kind of exit strategy,
all options should remain on the table.  By sticking with a no,
you’re signaling that your perceived value of your product and your
opportunity outweighs those options.  By signaling towards yes,
especially too early, you’re losing flexibility and influence in the
negotiation process.  And either way – yes or no – all options are
.. possibly on the table .. maybe?  So why signal an early yes?</p>

<h3 id="always-more-options-always">ALWAYS MORE OPTIONS! ALWAYS!</h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2016-05-12-facets-of-greatness-intro/gradius-option.png" alt="Gradius Options" /></p>

<p>And by playing the game so that your options remain open, you retain
flexibility.  At the same time, it’s important to know when to break
these general rules.  Don’t be an asshole and manipulate your
relationship with investors, etc. out of greed.  Those guys are
fucking smart, they will know.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s actually what VC’s and Angel’s do: they read people to
leverage business relationships, <em>with precision</em>. And people entrust
them with <em>billions</em> of dollars to do so, <em>with precision</em>.  They have
hundreds of times more experience at the negotiation table and
managing board politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Picture it like this.  Do you want to be part of this conversation?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh yeh… we invested several hundred million of our 5 year funding
cycle on that shiny startup. But we forget to ask this one leeeettle
question and we lost all <em>their</em> money.”</p>

<p>Knowledge is power, as stated by that maxim from time immemorial.
And, yep, it’s true, in case you hadn’t figured that out yet. I think
everyone knows this, but there are many out there who, whether they’re
younger or older, feel it is pointless to engage in the academic
pursuit of knowledge, for whatever reason.  Sometimes it’s because
they don’t see the potential in themselves, which is depressing.
Sometimes it’s because, because of the combination of their beliefs at
the time and whatever life circumstances they’re dealing with, they
perceive it to be futile or pointless.  And I’m really not sure if
that is less depressing or more depressing.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, it’s incredibly disheartening when someone develops
antipathy towards the pursuit of knowledge because it’s how we equip
ourselves with the tools we need to free ourselves from whatever
limitations we have in life.</p>

<p>Knowledge drives how you see a system compared to how others see the
same system.  The difference between your model and that of others
determines your belief that there is opportunity where others see only
risk. This also determines the available options for mitigating risk.
So it’s important to not only understand things but also understand
how other people understand them.  And know how to determine which
model someone applies towards a problem and how they acquired
information.</p>

<p><a name="vision"></a></p>

<h2 id="x1f48e-visionvision-1">💎 <a href="#vision">Vision</a></h2>

<p>Vision, story and identity are really aspects of the same thing, which
is how your persona, your organizations, your struggles and your
dreams will be perceived by various groupings of people at different
points in time.  Your knowledge helps you construct your vision for
where your field of passion is headed.  Perhaps it’s your local
community or your family’s business.  And your vision doesn’t
encompass your ideas of where things will go, or where they could go.
Your vision needs to incorporate your idea of where it <em>should</em>
go.</p>

<p>You have to know where you’re going before you can begin your journey
… or at least, you should. Your vision helps inform you and your
organization to begin composing strategies for getting there. The
difference between your vision and the idea of where everyone else
thinks that trends will lead needs to be fueled by your passion and
knowledge of your subject or field.  You don’t have to explain this
difference but you need to be able to rationalize it and be capable of
conveying the how and the why, at least within your organization. One
of the best examples of communicating a vision is Macintosh’s 1984
Superbowl Commercial.  I’ll elaborate more on why in that section.
But before that commercial aired, most people were barely emotionally
invested in personal computers.  The commercial established the idea
that there might be another radically different option before they
were aware that there could be another option.  It set consumers’
expectations so that they would approach and judge the Apple
experience based on being different.  I could easily write 10,000
words on just that ad.</p>

<p><a name="story"></a></p>

<h2 id="x1f48e-storystory-1">💎 <a href="#story">Story</a></h2>

<p>Everyone loves a good story. This is one of the most valuable tools
you have.  Not only does a great story help you connect with people
and gather momentum, but by focusing on how you’ll tell the story as
you live it ensures that you’ll enjoy it as it happens and when you
tell it.  If you’re focused on it as it happens, you’ll notice more
about your experiences and you’ll retain more of the right
details. Imperatively, you’ll be able to focus on living your story as
so to embed meaning and value for others.  This requires cultivating a
zen-like awareness of the present moment, which I’ll describe in the
section on Story.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What would the hero in your story do?” &lt;= This, I like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your story will make your brand and your identity more relateable.
When you and your cofounders faced adversity, how did you overcome it?
When it looked like things were hopeless, what did you do?  Did you
build yourself up from nothing?  Or were you just handed and
opportunity? What mistakes did you make and why?  What strained your
relationships with your team and what compromises did you make to
account for that?  How did you build your team and cultivate your
relationships?  What values did you stress when deciding the kind of
culture you would imbue into your startup or project?  When were you
closest to giving up and what kept you going?  What tools do you use
when you find yourself or your team struggling or getting blocked up?
Many of the toxic problems that seep into a team and corrode their
relationships accrue slowly.  Often, by the time you find them, the
problems can be one hundred times worse than if the root cause was
addressed early.  So how did you assess your team members and
identify that the seeds for these problems were growing?</p>

<p>These questions are relevant to anyone and everyone.  The answers are
not the same in every situation, but unfortunately, we often don’t
know to even contemplate these issues beforehand.  And that’s the
value of experience.  By living your life and your story in such a way
that you notate the important details and decisions, you can more
effectively share that experience with others later on.  Even if you
fail, if nothing else, you have your experience.  For all of these
questions, it is invaluable to envisage your options, ideals and
decision-making processes before you have to answer them.  If you’re
always reacting, you’ll always be several steps behind.  Remain
proactive, by deliberating these and other important questions
beforehand.</p>

<p>Your story should drive the development of your vision. It should help
you and other people understand the <em>why</em> behind your vision. The best
way to think about an idea for a new product is to think about the
simple problems in your life.  What’s a good solution?  What do I keep
running into that wastes my time? Even if you don’t know the solution,
assess the problems you have and constantly search for new
perspectives.  A good problem to solve is relateable.  It’s something
everyone faces.  This problem you faced: remember it! It’s practically
required for a startup pitch.</p>

<p><a name="identity"></a></p>

<h2 id="x1f48e-identityidentity-1">💎 <a href="#identity">Identity</a></h2>

<p>Your vision and story should drive the development of your identity.
They become part of your image and are really all part of the same
thing.  They are past, present and future aspects of how you are
perceived, both by yourself and by others.  At times, I’ve been pretty
frustrated to need to struggle so hard against my image, but all this
upstream swimming and rhetorical jujitsu has made me smarter and
stronger.  It’s also taken quite a toll on me, so I hope to share some
of my experiences.</p>

<p>Your organization and the units within it also have image and
identity. You’re responsible for understanding how they are perceived
and for understanding how this perception might vary from group to
group. You need to develop means of constructing accurate self-image,
which is always in flux: from time to time, from person to person,
from group to group.</p>

<p>Identity and self-image is where empathy arises.  In particular,
empathy facilitates your ability to forge strong new relationships
with others, so it’s <strong>vital</strong> for <strong>networking</strong>, <strong>signaling</strong>,
<strong>communication</strong>, and <strong>orchestration</strong>. If you do not have accurate
awareness of the self, you cannot have robust empathy with
others. This is because empathy arises from considering how things
appear to others, but if you can’t see yourself for how you truly are
then what good would it do to you put yourself in their shoes?</p>

<p>And similarly, self-awareness drives your efficacy in all the facets,
but especially identity. It’s often referenced as one of the most
important traits for those in business and for leadership by some of
the greatest guru’s out there, who I’m sure can provide much more
depth for those neophytes of self-image, empathy and compassion.  Go
watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOrzmFUJtrs">TED</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IgOVOPLTYI">radical</a>.  Since
self-awareness is so foundational to identity and all the other
facets, I’ve embedded these talks at the end of this article.</p>

<p>How could you project a consistent image to others if you aren’t
self-aware or honest with yourself.  Occasionally, it it’s critical to
project a different image of yourself to multiple groups.  You’ll find
those that manipulate excel at this and their games depend on it.
Personally, while it’s incredibly difficult, I find that retaining and
projecting a universally consistent image to everyone – appearing to
be the same from anyone’s perspective – is one of the best things
someone can do.  Obviously, it’s incredibly challenging, it limits the
space of your actions and can be impossible, as some people just don’t
care to see you in an honest light. However, you’ll find that the most
auspicious, seraphic people find projecting a congruent self-image to
be worth the tremendous opportunity costs. And this is why it is
important to observe this quality in others. If someone goes through
great lengths to maintain coherent image to others, including those
whom haven’t established lengthy rapport, when it comes at hefty
personal risk, then that is a person you should trust, depending on
their ideals of course.</p>

<p>The corollary here: someone who projects a universally consistent
image of crap or of evil … is not so great. Who knows? Maybe
they’re secretly a cutesy kitten on the inside. Probably not though.</p>

<p>These people are pros at navigating the system. By system, I mean the
legal framework that exists in their locality, but it’s not just
limited to laws and regulations. Each organization and group create
their own “process frameworks” that specify how people will interact
and how tasks will be done. As for these process frameworks, there
tend to be both explicit and implicit processes.  Some of these aren’t
so clearly stated, but it’s crucial to be able to pick up on them
quickly, just like it is to assess a new group’s structure and
hierarchy.  If you’re going to get anywhere in business, not only do
you have to excel in reading these process structures, but also
designing them, implementing transitions between them and having the
experience to know what works.  It’s a common mistake to oversimplify
and assume you have the right changes to a particular process, but
“one thorn of experience is worth a wilderness of warning.” Sometimes
a slower or less efficient process allows you to better gauge risk,
assess your opportunity for more profitable options or develop a
stronger relationship with a customer.</p>

<p>As for the legal framework, you can’t construct a business plan or
negotiate with partners without knowing the details of how your
business entity will be structured.  Being aware of your options here
is critical, as nothing is worse then funnelling thousands into
starting your fledgling dream business, just to realize that you set
it all up wrong.  Knowing the basics on trademark, copyright and
patent law is a must if you’re going to properly structure and protect
your IP.  This is critical if you don’t have very much money.  Filing
the wrong patent can be incredibly expensive and leave you incredibly
vulnerable.  Properly structuring a set of patents takes not only
requires domain expertise, but legal expertise as well.  Otherwise,
you’ll waste a ton of time and money at the patent office or get stuck
with a patent that can be invalidated later.</p>

<p><a name="strategy"></a></p>

<h2 id="x1f48e-strategystrategy-1">💎 <a href="#strategy">Strategy</a></h2>

<p>Strategy is really about the composition of tactics at various levels.
Business and life can be viewed through the lens of game theory. Both
are a mix of turn-based and real-time games. In life, one chooses
their objectives to optimize on based on their model of the world,
usually fairly early on.  Some people possess far more cognition and
metacognition, which both greatly extend your ability to assess and
model the world.  The earlier you cognitively develop, the better.
Doing so equips you with the meta-tools you need to construct the
model you’ll use to search for meaning in life, for your own purpose.
In business, you optimize on other factors and objectives, like value,
opportunity, diversity, control, risk, security and time.</p>

<p>As a generalized concept, strategy is about the composition of tactics
at various levels.  Reusable tactics are the best: if you’ve found
something that works in one field, industry or game, you’ll find that
you can usually rework it and apply it elsewhere.  Most tactics can be
generalized to varying degrees: you can change their form or
parameterize them by abstracting variables.  The most reusable
tactics are the best.  You can combine tactics with others or
deconstruct them into small pieces which can be rearranged.</p>

<p>Backward induction is a well-known technique in chess and other games.
It means you look for the endgame or midgame scenario that you’d like
to achieve and think backwards to identify sequences of moves that
will allow you to reach it.  I wrote about it in the third part of my
series on
<a href="http://te.xel.io/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html">Category Theory, Epistemology and Cognition</a>.
However, the proper execution of backward induction requires
deconstruction.  That is, you must take the optimal sequence of moves
that you’ve identified and reconstruct them in such a way that avoids
detection.  In a game like chess, you might insert blocking moves that
prevent the opponent from moving or choose moves that reinforce other
pieces or throw in moves to claim spaces in the middle of the
board. These moves are all but tangential to your true objective.
Otherwise, if you were to instead execute your sequence of tactics in
a direct manner, your opponent could easily determine your intentions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, appearances overcomplicate an otherwise simple
reality. If you don’t take into account how your opponent perceives
your actions or if you can’t detect that, you’ll always find yourself
behind.  No matter your level of “skill” in your game of choice, if
it’s a multiplayer game, there is always a meta-game.  Therefore, you
have to learn how to shield your tactics from detection. This usually
requires becoming skilled in the art of duplicity, if not deception.
However, deception errs on the side of outright cheating and it’s not
fun to play with those who have no rules.  Also, actions which can be
perceived in more than one way are always more valuable, inherently.
Learning how your opponent models the game is incredibly valuable as
well.  If you can observe through their conscious actions or
unconscious reactions pieces of the system they use to inform their
moves, then you can more accurately predict their next moves from
their play style.</p>

<p>The section on Strategy will cover much more, including why you should
be wary of making your objectives known and how to detect your
opponents’ strategies.  For example, in addition to looking at your
opponent’s actions, it can often prove more useful to look at what
they are <em>not</em> doing.  Specifically, when your opponent is
intentionally obscuring their intentions, reflecting on the actions
that seem to be off-limits to them is often the best way to unravel
their strategy …  which reminds me that it’s also incredibly useful
to weight an opponent’s action in terms of the energy they
invested. High-energy actions always mean much more. Or they usually
do anyways. You’d be surprised…</p>

<p>Orchestration is really the execution of strategy.  Whereas strategy
concerns intuition and knowledge of each of the other facets,
orchestration concerns coordination of each facet.  You’re working
with the processes and systems you’ve woven into your organization.
You’ll need to know what to do when these processes break down or
tactics don’t work.  If you’re organization is nimble and if you’re
maintaining proper communication, then you’ll be able to refocus the
organization’s energy in another direction when your systems
invariably malfunction.  If you’ve really stacked your chips right,
then even when things go wrong, it won’t matter much.  You won’t have
lost too much steam, if you’ve been aiming each stone for as many
birds as possible.  With orchestration, synergy is what you’re looking
for.  How can you coordinate each facet, so that everything you do
satisfies multiple objectives.  Grandmaster chess players remain
flexible with their available moves and even though each piece is
backing up multiple pieces, it seems like they have a maximum number
of available “safe” moves.  In business and life, this means knowing
how to design with redundancy and resilience in mind.</p>

<p>Maybe try again in a week.  It’s a Shrödingers Box.  Sometimes there’s
nothing, but sometimes there’s a lil kitty.</p>

<p>The Unknown facet encompasses what we don’t know or can’t know. This
includes attributes that are difficult to pin down. It also includes
those attributes that aren’t typically associated with greatness,
which for whatever reason, end up being one of those critical things
that really <em>made</em> someone.  Far too many people associate being
different with weakness.  They seek to identify what makes others
different and they point it out.  They question it.  They criticize
it.  Sometimes they accept it, and sometimes people will try to use it
in some way.  Often, instead of embracing our own unique quirks as
strengths, we buy into all the criticism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always be yourself, stick to what you know to be true, trust your
gut and believe in yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We should become comfortable with what we can’t do yet or with what we
haven’t learned.  By challenging ourselves to experience what is
uncomfortable or difficult, we expand our ability to deal with those
situations the next time.  Because our mind is the product of ideas
and processes that it can combinate, then by developing skills which
are challenging and difficult for most, our mind will become more
capable than others.  Some of us have unique challenges that prevent
us from experiencing some things and this means that there are some
ideas or extensions of those ideas which aren’t available to
everyone. Or rather, those ideas are only available vicariously. But
we should embrace those people who can expand our minds by sharing
experiences that we can’t have or can’t truly know.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-wisdom">What is Wisdom?</h3>

<p>Wisdom is knowing what to do when you do not know.  You need to have
the intuition to dig deeper when it seems that you have a set course
of action.  When it seems you already have a viable set of options,
you have to exercise patience to ensure you’ve truly examined the
situation.  Usually, picking from the cards dealt to you is fine, but
sometimes you’ll find there’s not a single fair card in each hand
dealt to you.  Also, you have to know when to make a stand and when to
hold your cards. Yet, on the other hand, you absolutely have to be
capable of recognizing a situation where doing nothing is the <em>only</em>
wrong course of action.  Some of these are very hard concepts to
balance, which is why it’s crucial that we understand our own values,
as well as the emotions and behaviors that drive us. If we know what
drives us and we have a nearly concrete set of values, then we can
remain grounded and centered in the face of tumultuous discord.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-break-through">How to Break Through</h2>

<p>I see many of these qualities in myself, though I fear it’s too late.
Becoming great and freeing yourself from the chains of a “normal” life
is quite rare.  You’ll find that it often requires the coordination of
one or two previous generations for someone to really “break through.”
Does it require being born into the aristocracy or the upper middle
class? No. Does it require access to a network of the rich and famous?
No. A fortuitous opportunity, perhaps divined by fate? No, though the
best of us will make the most of our luck and those situations which
are truly once in a lifetime.</p>

<p>So what does it mean to break through and what does it take? It really
is quite rare. I’m talking about the success that is quite often 1 in
100,000. You’ll find that people born into wealthy circumstances can
be quite stunted in their development. And, similarly that those born
into poverty often lack the resources or opportunities to develop.
It’s expensive to be poor.  That is true.</p>

<p>Instead, I view this as a kind of natural selection for
psychology. It’s the people who have the perfect mashup of ideas and
behaviors in their minds who become wildly successful. It’s the people
who have the perfect mix of positives, without the wrong kind of
negatives who end up breaking through. The meme’s and ideas that
develop in these people’s minds, coupled with the perfect timing and
just the right combination of serendipitous events results in a mind
that responds to more effectively extract the positives out of a
situation without being restrained by the negatives. It’s one that,
coupled with the guidance of others, perfectly creates fertile
situations in front of them.</p>

<p>So, what’s the most important factor in creating the perfect artist
and business minds?  IMO, it’s the structure of the minds of their
parents and how the parents raise their child.  Often, you’ll look at
someone’s life and see that not only did the previous generation
affect their upbringing, but the generation before that as well.
Obviously, this is something that <em>can</em> be easier to provide for
affluent families, but wealth is absolutely not required and usually
you’ll find that it hurts.  Instead, families that have struggled for
a generation or two will develop a perspective and outlook on life,
coupled with strategies for self-actualization and propagating that
knowledge, which all contribute greatly towards success in this
“natural selection” of “ideal” psychology.</p>

<p>And the most important point for me to stress here is that there are
sooo many small mistakes someone can make that result in massive risks
or costs to someone’s career.  The seeds for your career start when
you are young and every moment matters, whether you realize that at
the time or not.  There are some early behaviors, beliefs or actions
– which usually require high maturity or a parent’s guidance or
interference – and these can either make you or break you.  My point
is that it’s usually impossible for most people to comprehend these
unspoken “rules” <em>at any point in their life</em>, much less between
15-25, which are really the critical years.  And so, they either don’t
approach life with these goals in mind and miss the opportunity or
they break these “rules” and unknowingly lose the opportunity.</p>

<p>However, it’s important for me to state that there is not a singular
“ideal” psychology and, in fact, you’ll find that this kind of great
success is often an ironic curse.  It can bear a terrible price and
one might struggle for it, never to achieve it. Or struggle for it in
vain without realizing they’d already committed too many mistakes. For
me, I’ve been so stubborn and singularly focused on building a
product, refusing to give up, that I’ve nearly destroyed my life.</p>

<p>One factor holding America back is the waning influence that the family
has in building the next generation.  We spend almost no time
together.  There are fewer conversations and fewer family dinners.
Alas, that’s the subject for another post.</p>

<h2 id="learn-from-the-fool">Learn From the Fool</h2>

<h3 id="if-you-are-wise">If You Are Wise</h3>

<p>Instead, let’s look at some of the largest factors which could prevent
someone from attaining greatness.  And then I’ll describe a few of my
mistakes.  I’m really not going to cover everything though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Fools learn from experience.  I prefer to learn from the experience
of others.” - Otto von Bismarck</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, keep in mind that I believe that many of these ideals go
against my own ideas of what it means to be a virtuous person.  I
can’t stand playing to appearances or adhering to many of the other
so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power">Laws of Power</a>.
It’s a book that I detest by the way – the wikipedia article notes
it’s significance to prison inmates – but it’s a book that is very
worth reading if you want to defend yourself against its
tactics. Please keep that in mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The knowledge of power spreads fast, like fire.  A lust for power
can corrupt men who would otherwise remain virtuous by tempting with
the desire to reshape the world around them, bending it to their
will. Far too often, this comes at the cost of sacrificing their
character, their ethics, their friends or the very notion of
friendship itself.  You’ve been warned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="guard-your-reputation-with-your-life">Guard Your Reputation With Your Life</h3>

<p>What does one need to avoid?  Since becoming great requires a lot of
exposure and often courting someone’s attention who would, in a way,
vouch for you, then you need to guard your reputation as though it
were your life.  Your reputation is like a kind of currency, which you
can accrue over time or you can squander in a moment.  For me, I
picked drug legalization, one of the worst causes for my reputation,
as it led to soooo many doors being slammed in my face, though I can’t
say I regret supporting ending the War on Drugs.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-circle-tight">Keep Your Circle Tight</h3>

<p>Getting that big break often requires getting the approval of other,
already successful people who at least equally desire to protect their
reputation and their already secured position.  These people will want
to vet anyone that gets close to them.  They have a set of friends who
have proven their trustworthiness and they’re wary of letting people
in.</p>

<p>Similarly, you need to keep your circle tight.  While new people can
sometimes bring opportunity, they often come bearing baggage or rotten
fruit. Especially if you don’t vet them.  This is another great
ability to develop: you need to be able to quickly run people through
a gambit and understand how they’re going to react in various similar
future situations.  All while appearing approachable and
non-judgemental.  This was something that wasn’t explicitly taught to
me by my family.</p>

<p>All of this contrasts my own values (to a greater degree in the past)
because I like being exposed to all kinds of people, regardless of
whether they would be positive or negative – mostly because i want to
learn about them.  Isolation also bears a cost and if you’re always
around people you’ve carefully chosen, can you really say that you
“know” people?  Honestly, living life in such a guarded, cautious
manner – is it really worth it?</p>

<p>Then again, if you’ve made so many sacrifices already in your life and
you’ve remained calculated and guarded for so long, are you really
willing to bring someone in who could disrupt that?</p>

<h2 id="in-summaryin-summary"><a href="#in-summary">In summary</a></h2>

<p>Many people I know scoff at my attempts to build a product.  Some of
them laugh at my ideas; some will point towards my reputation or
perceived weaknesses or past failures; others will claim that I don’t
have the communication skills.  But almost no one has tried to team up
with me.  For the few that have, it just seems that our circumstances
don’t happen to line up at that time.  Thank you anyways.</p>

<p>But, for my detractors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone asked you to write 10,000 - 30,000 words on the factors,
traits, events and conditions required to master leadership, so that
you could build something great, what would you write?  If someone
asked you to speak for three hours on the subject, what arguments
would you make?  What historical allegories would you choose to
illustrate your points?  What would others say in response?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While my words are far from eloquent and while I’m far from perfect
myself, how long are people going to try to claim that I don’t know
what I’m talking about or that I’m mentally insane? Honestly?
… <em>Fuck you</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A leader’s capacity to lead is the sum of his/her influence on
coordinating the actions of others.  A leader without followers
might have all the internal factors required to be great.  But
without followers, they still only have 24 man-hours in a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, a leader who finds it difficult influence others, for
whatever reason, is not really a leader.  What is incredibly
frustrating is when this difficulty arises from the <strong>interference</strong>
of others.  And it really just comes with the territory.  Power is
alluring and you’ll find that others want it and sometimes they don’t
want you to have it.  But when you realize that, for a decade, people
have been subtly undercutting you and assaulting your reputation and
trying their damnedest to prevent you from amounting to someone with
influence – you’ll find this to be quite angering.  Especially if
you’ve made a ton of sacrifices to retain your personal definition of
ethics or morality.</p>

<p>Anyway, not one person has contributed more than an hour <em>with me</em> to
any product idea I’ve had.  For all my viable business ideas and all
my quirky tech ideas too, I have not been able to identify a single
person who seems to want to be a cofounder.  Much of this is my fault,
for not networking enough and spending 100% of my available time
programming instead of finding a team with which i could delegate
responsibility.  But, it is strange, right?</p>

<p>Again, I see some of these facets manifested in myself and I know that
other people do as well.  Many of them, I observed and learned too
late, as I’ve already made far too many mistakes.  However, I believe
that others can draw on the experience of your mistakes.  And that, if
the experiences of these problems are shared, instead of covered up
and hidden, people can greatly benefit from that.  Even when many of
those problems may be embarrassing or expose personal vulnerability.</p>

<h3 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h3>

<p>Vulnerability, especially when visible – does its mere presence and
visibility imply weakness in great people?  If we always hide our
vulnerabilities, how can we teach those we care about what to hide and
what to show and how to talk to people about problems and who to trust
about them?  If appearance trumps reality, then is it worse to have a
perceived vulnerability or an actual one?  How does one’s own
awareness of them change things?  And when is it ethical to lead
others into believing someone possesses some weakness like this?</p>

<p>The intention behind this matters, but I’ve found time and time again
that if someone really cares about you, then they will let you know
about it.  If they’re trying to score political points in the office,
then they won’t involve you when calling attention to your
vulnerabilities. IMO, it’s tragic that we would end up with this kind
of culture in the workplace… If someone only seeks to exploit their
coworkers vulnerabilities to score political points and gain greater
influence in their local workspace – instead of working with their
colleague to address and improve them – then doesn’t that leave us
all more vulnerable as a group?  That’d imply that some negative
political behavior in the workplace is not only abrasive, but
corrosive.  And without the proper systems in place to keep this
behavior in check, the wrong people rise to the top by employing
shady, opportunistic tactics while simultaneously leaving groups in
various social strata much more vulnerable, in aggregate.</p>

<p>Also, if it’s important to learn from these people by examining their
biographies and lives, so we can grow from their experiences, then
doesn’t the distortion of reality and the total obliviation of these
flaws detract from what we’d otherwise learn? If so many biographies
are written posthumously – and if these people live their lives
seeking to hide their weaknesses and call attention to their strengths
– then how can we hope we’ll capture the truth at all?  Obviously, as
with everything else, the right answer lies somewhere in the
middle. IMO, we should focus on telling those stories that can help us
all grow.  And I believe the solution to addressing our
vulnerabilities lies in cultivating self-awareness, so that we are not
dependent on someone else being respectful and tactful enough to help
us address them in the right way.  And self-awareness is something
I’ll discuss in the section on identity and image.</p>

<p>As for me personally, are these lessons a blessing or a curse? Only
after a decade of painful mistakes did I learn any of this. I’m never
sure whether my stubbornness is a positive or negative trait, but it’s
only by refusing to give up did I ever learn any of this.  Everyone
around me – my friends and family – wanted me to give up or just get
a job and be distracted. Maybe they were really thinking of my best
interest – it’s nearly destroyed me.</p>

<p>The ambition required to pursue a path like this ends up fostering
attachment in me that should not otherwise exist.  If I didn’t desire
success and greatness out of a belief that, properly postured, I could
truly benefit the world, the I wouldn’t want it at all. And yet,
ironically, now that I’ve learned all this, I can see it, but I’m in
no position to effectively use it.</p>
