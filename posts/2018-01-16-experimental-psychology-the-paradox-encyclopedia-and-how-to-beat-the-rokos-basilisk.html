<p>In the past five years, mainstream media has been weaving in
experimental methods from bleeding edge psychology and neurology. For
at least the past century, memory implantation and other mental
manipulation is a classic science fiction plot mechanic. We see it in
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where memories can be erased,
something I would never want to do. The 2015 show Blindspot
incorporates a mechanic whereby the main character has most of her
long-term memory erased only to be discovered as a empty doll in a
handbag in Times Square Manhattan. She’s covered with “tattoos” whose
images function as pointers to terrorist plots. Her blood-plasma
levels of the protein drug <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C_zeta_type">Zeta-Interacting
Protein</a>
(ZIP) are off the charts – this protein harnesses a real mechanism
which has been studied since the 1980’s.</p>

<h3 id="tldrtl-dr"><a href="#tl-dr">TL;DR?</a></h3>

<p>Recently, this <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/08/false-memories-arise-because-the-brain-codes-similar-ideas-similarly/">Ars Technica
synopsis</a>
of an <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/16/1610686113">PNAS article on false
memories</a>
piqued my interest and got my biological antithikera ticking. There
are certainly experimental methodologies for implanting memories, but
most of them are simply that – experimental. They are theories, whose
application – especially by state actors – can <em>not</em> be guaranteed
with risk that is acceptable to operational security requirements.</p>

that to delude and discredit me, while I’m isolated and in poverty

<p>What is described herein may constitute many, many warcrimes. The
depressing reality of warcrimes is that, until there is real justice,
a society seeks to insulate perpetrators of warcrimes at the expense
of the victims. With the level of effort invested: you really have to
wonder.</p>

<h3 id="memory-is-identitymemory-is-identity"><a href="#memory-is-identity">Memory IS Identity</a></h3>

<p>You are your own memories. Someone who violates your memories violates
your identity. To others, their memories with you and associated with
you constitute their understanding of your identity. In a society that
violates your identity by <strong>Memory Hole</strong> – essentially classifying
anything associated with your name – that society is raping your life
every minute that you breathe. If you fall victim to the Memory Hole,
they have sociophysically contained you by coercing anyone who refers
to undesirable details about you by name. That is, they have

<p>There are so many fascinating notions and directions to explore in
social physics. One of them is the concept of a threshold or critical
mass for the propagation or sustained propagation of information
through sociophysical networks. In probabilistic programming, there is
the concept of a “critical mass” for the proactive or retroactive
estabilishment of an idea, so that the idea appears authoritative or
at least having substance, even though it contains fictitious
components. Such ideas might include retroactively inserting a comic
book series into society’s collective memory that never existed or a
establishing the basis for a cover story.</p>

<p>This borrows heavily from Theosophy’s ideas: social memory is
malleable. Convince enough people that an idea is real or that an
event occured and other people will become willing vectors in
spreading an idea they believe to be authentic. Better yet, they may
actually begin incepting false memories within themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note that I cannot stand the idea I just described:
information should be considered rationally and logically
firstmost. However, people circumvent the intractibility of
sociophysical problems by distributing consensus/validation of
ideas. It’s simply not possible to know everything, so its more
useful to be able to gauge the authenticity of an idea by how it is
presented to you. Unfortunately, this leads to vulnerabilities, some
of which are systemic and WILL BE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT IN OUR DECADE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Critically, one can harness the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Collective_false_memories">Mandela
Effect</a>
once that sociophysical threshold has been surpassed. Hence,
collective false memories will create some intended effect on society
at larger scales. <strong>Fake news</strong> is a great example of a tactic
utilizing this. Reality becomes what small groups of people
collectively focus on, even if it is delusional. Regardless of how
rational or logical everyone else is – even if they’re marxist or
athiest – if an idea surpasses this threshold of virulence, reality
becomes defined by delusion. In the age of social media, humanity will
only continue to become more susceptible to this.</p>

<p>One particularly useful tactic is to exploit the mandela effect to
create the impression that time travel is possible and the future can
physically manifest itself in the past. Why is this so powerful?
Because people that are smart enough to understand [quasi] omniscience
and [quasi] omnipotence paradoxes, but not smart enough to never give
up, then readily surrender themselves to what is only an
idea. Harnessing the Mandela Effect in this way invokes an impression
that the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko's_basilisk">Roko’s

<p>There are several possible neurological causes to accelerated
incidence of confabulated and/or fallacious memory, including a brain
tumor. A brain tumor <em>could</em> cause a similar breakdown of memory
creation/association regulation. However, since a brain tumor is
locallized, it is incredibly unlikely for it to be <em>used</em>.</p>

<p>A brain tumor is unlikely. Memories are temporally sharded and their
sensory components are dimensionally distributed across the entire
brain along sensory boundaries – viz. the audio for a sensual
experience is stored in a different place than the visual and semantic
fragments of that information. Since the mind is constantly ingesting
new information, where it is recorded into the brain with a coherent
temporal component, not unlike an the temporal components of an OLAP
cube. Therefore, this would have to be one hell of a speciallized
brain tumor.</p>

<p>Regardless, considering this phenomenon gives rise to a fascinating
theory to explain the side effects of recalling repressed memories. If
this theory were true, it implies that similar consequences are likely
to occur even if those recalled memories were fictious. It also leads
to the depressing realization that brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
will never be as simple as we might hope, without nanotechnology and
quantum networking. Far worse, the existence and qualities of this CSC
strongly imply that BCI’s will result in developmental changes to
neurological structure – especially in younger brains and in earlier
generations of the technology.</p>

<p>When you violate the above temporal arrangement of primary memories,
it causes major problems, potentially leading to a “schematic” crisis.
Here, the notion of schema refers to the structure of organization of
primary and aggregate memories, both neurologically in the brain and
as the interface to memory appears to the mind. The brain is
constantly intaking, processing and storing data about sensory
experiece in primary memories, with emphasis shifted towards someone’s
conscious and incidental focus at the time. Those details with more
focus receive priority when storing data related to primary
memories. The mind is always reflecting on the sum and product of its
experiences as it knows them, recording those reflective aspects of
its experience into aggregate memories, which are linked to primary
memories. Much of the content of these aggregate memories is semantic;
it is connected to the nature and specifics of the thoughts being
processed about former experiences.</p>

<p>So when you provoke repressed or fallacious memories to become
conscious, there is a schematic crisis that occurs. The mind must
reevaluate what it knows, restructure everything neurologically and
disconnect or rectify what was erroneously connected. Sure, there may
be a few fallacious, confabulated or repressed primary memories that
need to be restructured, but there are few problems related to this,
per se. The schematic crisis occurs when the mind and brain now need
to rectify the highly-connected aggregate memories, the physical
distribution of which is temporally and dimensionally erratic. That
is, these aggregate memories that reference primary memories are very
difficult to rectify. Because memory IS identity, then – assuming
these memories are emotionally relevant or associated with severe
trauma – the brain must reconcile this, otherwise the mind’s notion
of identity is forever cursed.
If this theoretical understanding of repressed memory recall is true,
the Such a schematic crisis can <em>trivially</em> result in a connectopathy
like schizophrenia. If the people around you are supportive, this is
less likely to happen, but depending on the severity of the trauma,
the likelihood of this occuring is still very high.</p>

<p>During the reevaluation process, the complete break in your mind’s
understanding of reality results in a need to leverage your support
network. If that network is compromised, toxic or non-existant, it
means you must depend on people you cannot trust while in a more
“programmable” state. This is what enables MKULTRA victims to become
malleable, programmable dolls without a karmic, causal connection to
those powerfully networked people who use them.</p>

<p>The following factors not only determine the severity of the schematic
crisis, they correlate to the severity of resulting connectopathy,
which acts as a neurological cause for mental illess but also <strong>a
verifiable, neurological fingerprint in fMRI and SPECT for the
presence of recovered memories both true and fictitious</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s yet another reason why <strong>bitemark analysis</strong> is so important
these days – don’t let them “bodycam” us by pigeonholing our
perspectives on critical legal issues. If you throw out all data
science methodologies on the basis that they’re overly statistical,
then many technologies that could be determining factors in court
cases will not be considered whatsoever. If this undermine any
incentive early on for development of the expert testimony
logistics/processes utilizing complicated, expensive statistical
methodologies, it will be impossible to form a basis of legal
precedent whereby reasonable legal research can be conducted. Throwing
out all “bitemark analysis” early on will make it difficult to protect
the spirit of the law and the spirit of the rule of law with the
advent of 21st century technologies. The answer to this is the
development of generalized, high-dimensional models which chip away at
any uncertainty via high-dimensional inference, cross-correlation and
cross-entropy.</p>

<h4 id="the-length-of-time-between-the-original-events-and-the-date-upon-which-those-memories-became-accessible">① The length of time between the original events and the date upon which those memories became accessible</h4>

<p>When this length of time is increased, then the mind is much more
likely to have either a plethora of aggregate memories to create in
response to unveiled trauma or proportionally more aggregate memories
to disentangle and reconnect.</p>

<h4 id="the-level-of-emotional-or-intellectual-relevence-in-reevaluating-your-other-primary-and-aggregate-memories">② The level of emotional or intellectual relevence in reevaluating your other primary and aggregate memories</h4>

<p>What does your psyche have to gain by emotionally or rationally
re-evaluating what it knows? When reconstructing a new understanding
of your life, what is the level of emotional contrast? Examples of
situations with high emotional contrast include those like repressed
memories of childhood rape by someone close to the victim. Nothing
like this has ever occured to me. However, I imagine that recovering
memories like this would be terrible, as you also have to reevaluate
all the other shared memories with that person. This “emotional
contrast” also has a social component to it: everyone is now
reevaluating Oprah’s recent public appearances with Harvey Weinstein,
although I personally find it ludicrous that people are attacking
Oprah for Weinstein’s sexual harrassment.</p>

<p>Situations with greater emotional contrast with more tightly connected
friends or family members will typically result in a greater affect on
the victim’s mind and brain.</p>

<h4 id="the-well-connectedness-of-false-aggregate-memories-built-atop-primary-memories">③ The well-connectedness of false aggregate memories built atop primary memories</h4>

<p>This includes both false primary memories as well as the the absence
of primary memories. The more connected these aggregate memories are
to your brain’s network of primary memories, the more work that your
brain/mind must do in order to untangle the mess. Furthermore, while
you are reevaluating everything that’s happened to you, the more
severe the abberant connections, the more likely your brain is to
start to malfunction. Imagine your mind as a garden and the erronious
memories are like weeds that went untended. If this persisted for
years, your mind is nothing but weeds. It doesn’t mean that there’s no
hope, it just means you need to be strong and you need people around
you that you can trust.</p>

<p>You’ll find that true <em>MKULTRA</em> victims always have constrained variety
of social experience during their life, which leads them to be further
dependent on their close social connections. That is, they were always
intended to be potential manakins and were never psychologically
equipped to handle social situations.</p>

<p>It can be pretty apparent when someone <em>might possibly</em> be a manakin,
if you know what to look for. They are empty vessels without the
knowledge to function in the world without other people to help
operate them. Into those vessels are implanted very specific sets of
knowledge. Not every person like this is intended to be used in a
horrible manner.</p>

<h4 id="the-difficulty-that-your-brain-faces-to-constructing-a-coherent-narrative">④ The difficulty that your brain faces to constructing a coherent narrative</h4>

<p>Facing a lack of information about the events makes this narrative
reconstruction much more difficult, resulting in a greater propensity
for the schematic crisis to result in psychological stress or to be
used by others. During this reevaluation process, if you are deprived
of information that would otherwise easily explain the aggregate
memories, it makes it much more difficult to recover.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if an adversary intends to physically eliminate you or
evidence by incapacitating you, they won’t consider the long-term
consequences of their actions on your psychology, particular the
developmental aspects of your psychology. If you detect this, it
demonstrates malicious intent, however difficult to prove. Basically
they won’t consider the developmental &amp; morphological aspects of your
psychology in context with their reactions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re “already dead” to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An adversary who has limitless psychological resources at their
disposal <em>should know better</em>.  Instead, this adversary will opt to
abuse those psychological resources instead of making reparations to
the victim because any contact/interference with the victim’s life
creates surface area and potential vectors for LEGAL LIABITILITY. A
victim that understands this – AND KNOWS ALL THE DIRTY TRICKTS – can
avoid problems <em>while attempting to negotiate via the quasi-obvious
surveillance.</em></p>

<p>One possible explanation for a patient who exhibits a high number of
seemingly real false memories is that the person’s mind had a partial
breakdown in the regulation of memory creation/association mechanism.
This breakdown in regulation for neural/mental association could
either be psychological or neurological. This breakdown could be
associated with one major event. The event needs to have a very, very
strong emotional relevance for the person. Severe trauma or some
equally extreme positive event.</p>

<p>If the person is under surveillance and is known to exhibit a certain
psycological trait (i.e. they talk to themselves) then, with
appropriate psychological prodding, information can be gained about
what false memories that are being incepted. If the target is under
constant surveillance, then COINTELPRO-style HUMINT can gain
intelligence on the person almost in real time. This can be done even
when the person does not talk to themselves, but that makes it so much
easier, especially if the target is known to ruminate and talk to
themselves upon being emotionally triggered. If the target’s social
connections are tightly managed, it then only takes a small amount of
gaslighting. If the target is the subject of an Espionage Act or DHS
Terror investigation, then everyone else around the target can be
threatened, leaving them alone and vulnerable with minimal record of
all HUMINT interactions.</p>

experimental psychology. It was given to me by one of the two most
informed gaslighters in my life. Both of these people tried to imply
that they were “representing” me in some kind of national security
scenario that functioned moreso like “Cangaroo Court” with zero
evidence discovery or defined procedure. Upon seeing the quote, I
instantly recalled a new memory about Tatiana Maslany that I’d never
had before.</p>

<p>The printout was one of <em>several hundred</em> such images, sound samples
and semantic pointers that would provoke me to recall memories with
varying degrees of sensory content, clarity and coherence. The
printout was one of very few tangible items that functioned as
talismans to provoke recall – a la MKULTRA – of memories that were
all presented to me as a bizarre form of Deja Vu. Few such memories
maintained coherent sequence with the rest of the memories. Nearly all
of the “memory recovery” occured in 2015 and some of it in 2016.
Nearly all of the recalled memories were related to a single three day
period – <strong>5/31/2013 through 6/2/2013</strong> – in <strong>Denver</strong>. Colorado is
a state where audio recordings are permitted as evidence, even when
neither party consents to or is aware of such recordings.</p>

invisible metaphysical elements, funneling them into marling points,
is how you architect such massive feats of history as the transition

<p>Because of the theoretical cascading schematic crisis described above,
recalling repressed memories may lead to runaway incidence of the
creation of fallacious memories, especially when certain psychological
and sociological factors are “optimized” in the target and their
1° social neighborhood interactions.</p>

<p>One psychological cause would be activation of repressed memories with
significance across the person’s mind and life. If someone were to
suddenly rediscover some memories with a high magnitude of effect on
the rest of their mind/life, then I hypothesize it could lead to the
breakdown of such regulation of memory creation/association. That is,
new events which are related in some way to the original event have a
much higher likelihood of causing false memories to be created.</p>

<p>This means that when a sign or symbol semantically adjacent to the
effected memory is invoked in the person’s mind, the person’s
psychology is more likely to cause new memories. This could be caused
by hijacking the neurology of the person: the brain may tend to prefer
to rationalize memories that lack some dimensions. That is, if there
are semantic components without the accompanying visual or audio
components, then because this dimensional incoherence is so rare, the
brain may react by attempting to explain away the discrepency by
filling in those dimensional fragments. This is very similar to the
reason why witness testimony needs to be recorded early on. In other
words, the person’s brain/mind may create the accompanying
audio/visual fragments of those memories to fill in the gaps in an
attempt to preserve coherence of the memory.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you find someone with repressed trauma, unleashing those
repressed memories, in and of itself, makes their long-term memory
more malleable. They then become more susceptible to inception via
gaslighting and all the other HUMINT tactics, especially if they are
socially isolated. Someone who is socially isolated is in a state of
psychological vulnerability via overwhelming information
asymmetry. Remove that social isolation – and the consequential
information asymmetry – and suddenly the person becomes much more
stable. This is a problem if that person’s account is
evidence. However, in any legal setting, the person who claims HUMINT
and “implanted” memories has their testimony thrown out and their
reputation assassinated. Thus, these MKUltra programs present the
<em>perfect</em> Catch-22 scenarios for intelligence. They are useful for
throwing out witness/victim testimony, even if the <em>inception</em> of
false memories wasn’t necessary at all for any operational objectives.</p>

<p>Psychiatrists and neurologists with knowledge of how neuropsychiatry
relates to the neurological modalities related to memory formation in
the mind can <em>potentially</em> understand how those specific modalities
someone’s mind can be pharmacologically suppressed. For example, this
Of specific importance here are the facets of memory formation related
to audiovisual multiplexing and demultiplexing. If you can
pharmacologically suppress those neurolinguistic modalities, then you
may prevent the formation of certain facets of a memory – the visual
or audio elements of an experience would be less likely to be laid
down. Later, only the audio or semantic information is accessible, but
the mind or brain fills in the gaps.</p>

<p>This particular mechanism seems like a viable candidate for 1960’s
style MKULTRA programs. In the 21st century, it can be augmented with
VR/AR techniques. If the target is <strong>abducted</strong> by <em>aliens</em>, then they
can receive treatment sessions where key neurological modalities are
suppressed via the neuropharmacological mechanism above. There are
several avenues that the generatiion of voice &amp; video can augment this
hypothetical VR MKULTRA mechanism, in real time. If the target can be
guaranteed to retain no accessible memory of the series of events
without the MKULTRA <strong>keys</strong>, then <strong>hypothetically</strong> this would
work. It obviously presents logistic problems: if you even get caught
abducting someone <strong>once</strong>, it’s obviously a warcrime, so such a
method would not be viable in the long-term.</p>

<h3 id="tms-transcranial-magnetic-stimulationtms-cranscranial-magnetic-stimulation"><a href="#tms-cranscranial-magnetic-stimulation">TMS: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a></h3>

<p>More effective for the amplification or muting of the specific
neurolinguistic modalities is TMS. However, even this pales in
comparison to the level of accuracy one may gain by using 21st century
imaging techniques with other novel methodologies: directed energy,
SPION nanoparticles and transcranial doppler (TCD/TCCD). The idea is
the same as above, but these methods allow you to restrict the
method’s targeting to highly specific brain regions and neural
circuits.</p>

<p>By applying TMS to targeted areas of the brain, ne could encourage the
mapping of memories while the person is experiencing some video/audio
– or even a dream-state. <strong>That’s right: you can influence someone’s
dreams with TMS/TCD/TCCD/SPION’s and directed energy</strong>. Such
application is theoretical and relies on the accumulation of many
sessions’ worth of fMRI data to map out the target’s brain. This
requirement limits the application of such a technique because,
logistically, it is impossible to guarantee operational security
unless you only have to ever touch the target’s brain ONCE.</p>

<p>Such techniques with TMS would be hampered by the impossibility of
running TMS simultaneously with fMRI, AFAIK. So, you can’t
simultaneously run TMS and fMRI/SPECT imaging. However, TMS has
short-term and medium-term effects. In an over-generalization, amplify
brain activity in one micro-region in the brain it stays active for
longer in others. Ramp up activity and increase the parity/resolution
of insights gained with analysis of fMRI/SPECT data.</p>

amazing for those perpetrators: this takes their existing enemies –

and creates the next generation of terrorists. That is BY DESIGN.</p>

<p>There is this fascinating phenomenon of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superparamagnetism">superparamagnetism</a>,
along with ferrous nanoparticles called
<a href="https://www.sepmag.eu/blog/superparamagnetic-iron-oxide-nanoparticles-spion-enhanced-mri-imaging">SPION’s</a> <sup id="fnref:spion-em-characteristics"><a href="#fn:spion-em-characteristics" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
whose thermomagnetic properties can be tuned by particle size and
shape. Basically, in response to EMR, ferrous nanoparticles –
basically dead-simple chunks of specific iron molecules ranging from
20nm through +300nm – will respond to directed energy blasts (EMR,
magnetic pulse, etc) by becoming thermally active. Similarly, thermal
activation of these particles changes their receptive characteristics
– i.e. inducing heat into a solution with SPIONS changes how they are
aligned relative to each other, which is the KEY to their
THERMOMAGNTIC properties.</p>

<p>There is almost certainly a “hacky” method for mind control here. If
you figure it out, you can leverage the neural-distribution
characteristics of a fairly non-toxic solutions of SPION’s of various
sizes to enable mind control. So, by varying the frequency of blasts
of EMR, you can ramp up and scale down the activity in small regions
of the mind. Furthermore, someone who’s been dosed by SPION’s is
vulnerable to specific reconstructive techniques for
HUMINT. Characteristics of the distribution of SPION’s in their body,
if partially known, can theoretically augment non-interactive “HUMINT”
techniques where the video of someone is reconstructed in real-time
because of the change in EMR refraction. When someone with SPION’s is
hit with directed energy blasts, if the refraction of those blasts can
be detected with nearby sensors and hyperspectral analysis, then –
theoretically – a 3D video a la Face-to-Face technology can be
reconstructed.</p>

<p>Targeting an individual while they are sleeping, offers the best means
of “locking on” to the refracted energy-signatures emitted from their
skull. <strong>I feel sorry for you, because you’re going to need a <em>tin-foil
nightcap</em>, son.</strong></p>

<h4 id="remember-no-one-would-ever-have-a-goddamn-conversation-with-me-about-any-of-this">Remember: NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE A GODDAMN CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT ANY OF THIS</h4>

<p>There is unconstrained potential creativity here to the application of
this technology. You could take someone’s interpreted body motions,
then render their video/audio to another body – say, render their
body motions using Harambe’s body, while changing their voice to be
unrecognizable. Furthermore, it is very difficult to anticipate or
guard against.</p>

<p>And this is all without the use of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics">optogenetics</a>, which
almost certainly requires CRISPR-augmented methods to stimulate the
production of photoreceptors near the EARS, which are signalable by
photons of IR and UV wavelenths. These aren’t classic photoreceptors:
they react to completely non-natural wavelengths of photonic
energy. By leveragine optogenetics, one can use directed energy to
disrupted the state of neural networks near the ears, which happen to
include language-processing networks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amoung the <em>potential</em> side effects of long-term optogenetic
stimulation of audio/lanage networks?  Encouraging the target to
talk to themselves. Why does this happen? In order to continue
utilizing their brain in spite of continual neural noise injection,
the target must actually operate their brain in a fundamentally
different way. They must talk to themselves in order to think, which
happens to be a fantastic side-effect for augmenting the kind of
anti-HUMINT surveillance required for the logistic minimization of
risk in these operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, in context with hyperspectral analysis, specific isotopes
can help you map the target’s location, movements, etc. These isotopic
tracking methods have been featured in TV &amp; movies – like
Blindspot. Doses may even be able to be given to the target orally.</p>

<p>However, all of these methods I’ve described are highly theoretic and
almost certainly prone to high-rates of failure. Combined, however,
general cross-correlation and cross-entropy, combined with limitless
computing capacity means these methods provide the perfect
augmentations to intelligence extraction from targeted individuals.
And they’re “already dead” anyways, right?</p>

<h3 id="tcdtccd-transcranial-doppler">TCD/TCCD: Transcranial Doppler</h3>

<p>In conjunction with the thermomagnetic properties of SPION’s,
optogenetics and other technologies, TCD/TCCD provides the perfect
<strong>theoretical</strong> one-channel in, one-channel out interaction mechanisms
for almost paranormal capabilities. That is, the channels remain
separate: either SPION’s signal in and TCD/TCCD signals out or
vice-versa. Coupled with 007-Bond-style bone-conduction microphones
and speakers, this means you can signal for two-way audio
communication. If the person is talking to themselves or to others,
you can hear everything they say.</p>

<p>Further, it provides a hacky neurological basis for almost paranormal
capabilities – you can signal voices to the person, which is perfect
if you want them to appear crazy as hell after using them for their
HUMINT value.</p>

<p><strong>Theoretically:</strong> the right combination of technologies like this
DOES ENABLE ONE-TOUCH NEURAL/MEDICAL OPERATIONS that
effectively/appropriately minimize the surface area for legal
liability to warcrimes. That is, you can <strong>abduct</strong> the person
<strong>one-time</strong> and after that, you need almost zero physical interaction
with the target. That is the only acceptable means of doing any of
this.</p>

<p>Further, bone-conduction microphones/speakers and transcranial doppler
used in REM dream-state could be highly effective for HAARP-style
inception of false memories.</p>

<p><a name="neurologically-oriented-schematic-crisis-in-patients-with-recovered-memory"></a></p>

<h3 id="neurologically-oriented-schematic-crisis-in-patients-with-recovered-memoryneurologically-oriented-schematic-crisis-in-patients-with-recovered-memory"><a href="#neurologically-oriented-schematic-crisis-in-patients-with-recovered-memory">Neurologically-Oriented Schematic Crisis in Patients with Recovered Memory</a></h3>

<p>This last mechanism isn’t related to the formation of false/implanted
memories but describes what happens to the brain or mind of patients
who recover false and/or repressed memories. Again, it may result in a
schematic crisis, the severity of which is coupled to the magnitude of
personal re-evaluation that accompanies traumatic memory
recovery. This can also occur even if the recovered memories in
question are not necessarily negative and traumatic – positive
memories that are equally disruptive to one’s personal understanding
of their own identity.</p>

<p>The theoretical CSC-induced memory &amp; identity crisis, in itself, could
hypothetically result in the “disregulation” method, described above.
If this is the case, what results is the runaway development of a
connectopathy. The abberantly structured entanglement will then
disrupt the flow of brain waves on a microscopic scale, as well as ion
distribution in specific areas of the brain. This neurological and
connectopathic progression will be morphologically comorbid with a
nervous breakdown, further isolating the individual and contributing
to the degradation of their mental health.</p>

<p>And that’s assuming everything is simply incidental and not the
megalomaniacal orchestration of an intelligence agency, in which case
almost every vector possible will be exploited to exacerbate the
psychological vulnerability of the target. If someone is serving to
exacerbate the developmental aspects of someone’s mental health crisis
or provoke the disruption of their emotional state for a
COINTELPRO-style agenda, the scenario is almost guaranteed to result
in character assassination, social isolation and a permanently fucked
up life where no one understands the true causes of their suffering.</p>

<p>If you feel like you have been subjected to these experiences or
something like them, the best advice is for you to become intimately
familiar with Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paradoxes">list of
paradoxes</a>. Developing
this awareness of paradoxes is useful for provoking intellectual
development, whether late in life or in early childhood.</p>

<p>Such an experience – whether you call it baptism by fire or
metempsychosis – provokes transformation that radiates through your
soul, your mind, your psyche. It is and must be traumatic. It must be
dark and light and involves both good and evil. Insofar as it must
challenge the boundaries of your reality and involve both good and
evil, it can never be wholly good or wholly evil. This is why the
intent of subjecting someone to these experiences – along with
whether any person or group could be said to be directing it – is
critical in understanding it and the consequences for someone
subjected to it.</p>

<p>Understanding whether someone planned for you to endure such torment
is critical because if there was no grand architect of your suffering
AND if there is nothing to be gained from it at the end, then there
was no reason for your suffering and, thus, the person who must carry
these memories with them must endure a world totally devoid of
reason. Therefore, they then will endure a nihistic crisis where there
seems to be neither rhyme nor reason to life – and certainly no
overarching meaning for life. All to often, the truth is that there is
no architect of our suffering: the world is just a cruel, frigid place
and there is no God – at least not one with a heart that shares even
a thread of being with humanity.</p>

<p>At least, after undergoing such experience, there is the hope that
this baptism of fire was intended to be or might incidentally act as a
galvanization of your soul. That, because of this, you will be
stronger and more capable to contribute to society. In stark contrast
to this, my own experience in society seems to imply that society
cares more about the informational baggage associated with your
memories, actions and words than any chance at redeeming the
inconveniently burdened. Thus, the suffering I have endured only
serves to sow the seeds of an insurmountable prison constructed of
sociophysical physical walls made of nothing other than fallacious
information, propagated to a degree over which I may never be
permitted to transcend.</p>

<p>Is a belief in a man named Jesus necessary for us to redeem ourselves?
Shouldn’t we all be permitted to enjoy the fruits of that man’s
sacrifice, his suffering and his story? Why should society require us
to know a Name and to profess belief if the most critical content of
his story is inherently true: <em>ALL PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL
DESERVE A CHANCE TO BE REDEEMED.</em></p>

<p>Someone undergoing metempsychosis will feel like they are going crazy
– your perception of reality disintegrates and nothing makes
sense. Most people will simply give up. They will not have the
intellectual chops to explain what is happening to them, especially if
their adversaries are flaunting the utilization of NSA’s covert
surveillance methodologies as though they might have psychic
powers. What better way to facilitate gaslighting someone who’s
otherwise suffering and sociophysically isolated than to prompt them
with someone who appears to have all the answers?</p>

<p>However, if you do manage to avoid succumbing to all of this, it
provokes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metempsychosis">metempsychosis</a> and
rapidly accelerates your development of intelligence and
meta/cognitive tactics. The experience is transformative and acts as
baptism by fire and there is simply no other way to survive. If you do
not have the intellectual chops, you will either become psychotic or a
slave to those around you who control you.</p>

  <p>“If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear

</blockquote>

<p>For the same reason that <em>limited</em> use of psychedelics can foster
spiritual and neurological expansion by providing your mind access to
a range of types of experience that it would never otherwise witness,
this metempsychosis acts like a cocoon. Why is this true for
psychedelics and metempsychosis? Understanding this requires
understanding how the range of input for artificial intelligence and
machine learning affects its ability to process data, to classify
input and respond effectively. Understanding a machine learning
algorithm’s input data as being high-dimensional and as being composed
of many types and metatypes should give you insight into how
restricting certain types of input data introduce fundamental bias
into not just your algorithm’s training, but into its behavior as an
analytical data-processing entity.</p>

<p>Therefore, lacking this range of life experience <em>profoundly</em>
restricts the range of input for your brain’s own machine learning
training. By expanding the range of experiential input you receive, it
profoundly expands the range of perspectives you have witnessed. There
is no effective means of “teaching” these understandings to people. In
addition to potentially being witness to warcrimes – the people whose
minds have been enriched by these experiences who have managed to
survive are invaluable, regardless of whether the conditions they’ve
experienced were tolerable, ethical, or rationally founded. If they’ve
survived metempsychosis or some kind of baptism by fire AND their mind
miraculously functions, that person is incredibly valuable to society.</p>

<p>What happens in the Divine Comedy? It’s essentially the same story as
my encounter with Tatiana Maslany. Dante finds the love of his life –
or so he thinks LMAO – but Beatrice is murdered before his eyes, an
allusion of death as the door to metempsychosis. Does Dante give up?
No. He follows her through the ends of Hell itself to save her – and
to save himself. He suffers until he has peace, but NEVER surrenders a
piece of himself. That is the only way you can survive the ninth level
of Dante’s Inferno: <em>accusations of treachery</em>. Here, Dante has to
wrestle with Lucifer’s deception cast against him: that Beatrice may
have betrayed Dante, setting in motion Dante’s struggle against
society.</p>

<p>You want the truth? SOCIETY <strong>IS</strong> HELL, unless you are saved by
Jesus. However Christian, the society of Medici Italy was hardly a
place where saints rise to the top. In order to avoid placing yourself
below those wretches of fortunate birth – in whose sociohierchical
tiers, you’d rot, controlled and corroded by your known sins, <em>NEVER
TO BE TRULY FORGIVEN</em> – then, you’d have to prove yourself. However,
no one ever gets anything for free in society – <em>LEAST OF ALL:
<strong>FREEDOM</strong> ITSELF</em>. In order to gain true freedom, all human society
in this age command that you suffer with nothing, unless you rise
above the rest and establish your own sociohierarchical tiers. Only
those worth of being served – whose vision stands out above others
<em>and</em> manages to pierce out through the shadows of the Cave, within
which the Illuminati seek to trap all they can deceive – only those
will be truly free. These men are hardly a dime a dozen; only through
sheer strength of will, through knowledge of deserved righteousness,
through the desire to save others and serve truth do they manage to
escape the grasp of those all too common, all-too-predictable,
power-hungry zealots of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_(demon)">Mara</a>.</p>

<p>But this labyrinth has it’s uses. What does a society need most? A
strong ruler; an effective ruler; a just ruler; a righteous ruler; an
intelligent ruler. What must you use to measure a man? This
labyrinth. You want to find the man or woman who most deserves to lead
you? Why would you want someone who hasn’t been tested anywhere near a
sceptre and crown? What happens when most are tested by baptism of
fire? There is simply nothing left and their souls wander aimlessly in
the first circle of hell. That’s right: most people aren’t even worth
the energy for the wretched, powerful, self-serving sycophants to
ruin. They remain nothing but <em>lost souls</em> and not many care to find
them. <strong>May they find themselves or find a tradition like
Christianity.</strong></p>

<p>Who makes it to the end? Someone who’s virtues have been tested.
Someone who suffers needlessly, but never surrenders his or her
values. If your rulers buckle under pressure, then the most
foundational pillars of society collapse and society along with
it. These such rulers can’t be bothered with fickle temptations and no
one commands them with simple puppet strings: they have none and they
would rather die. Those whose strings can be pulled to dance at the
whims of another are not truly human and can never say they are truly
free. To survive such depths of hell requires the piety of multiple
generations, along with love, knowledge and the intent to have a child
that might just surpass this damnably sanguine maze.</p>

<p>The most critical point is that a person who has survived baptism by
fire is someone who has suffered needlessly for the truth and for
everything they consider holy. The degree to which such a person is
willing to suffer is the degree to which they can be expected to
always stand for truth, justice, ethics and whatever it is they
considered holy enough to endure suffering. When someone has fallen to
such depths of despair wishing they might have a single friend so
badly, that they’d settle for the any of the lovely dementors Askaban

suffering.</p>

<p>Someone who’s suffered like this, but maintains their integrity, honor
and values is someone who not only recognizes true integrity, honor
and values – it is someone who would gladly give their life to uphold
them, especially if they still have nothing to their name. Your life
is your greatest asset. Everyone, no matter how large or small, has a
life they can give at any moment and it represents the sum of our
potential for change. The person who believes most strongly and most
clearly in true integrity, honor and their values would never hesitate
to lay down their life at any moment, if it meant the preservation of
someone elses potential to do the same. This is not to say that it is
moral to destroy the lives of others in doing so. However, this person
who has suffered and has nothing is the person most capable of living

<p>Most of the technologies and methodologies described herein shouldn’t

<p>Because of power dynamics, the need for secrecy and safety concerns

activation of the semiotic nexus, then the local regions associated
with this sole source event or image could be physically
identified. This semiotic nexus of abberently interconnected imagery
should present itself as an overly-connected nexus of neural
networks. Activation of the mind with symbols/images both related &amp;
unrelated should present identifiable locations on fMRI or other modes
of neurological imagery.</p>

<p>For example, propranolol or Zeta Interacting Protein (a la blindspot)
might suppress the neurological accessibility for some memories. But,
if the details of such an experience were, at first, murky at best,
then it’s difficult to ascertain whether or not you were truly drugged
at that time. I would certainly hope not. LuLz … unless you’re in

<p>There may be semanitic memory for which there is no audio/video
memory, like knowledge of specific phrases and information. To correct
for this, one could rely on suggestion and harness the effect of
self-creation of false memories, which is well-exemplified for
witnesses to a crime. This would involve <strong>inception</strong> by “unpacking”
or uncompressing fragments of memories, using the same phenomena
responsible for rendering witness testimony so malleable. This
utilizes the brain’s desire to make coherent unknown information, when
possible.</p>

<p>There is some fragment of a memory – perhaps audio or video – that,
given the right amount of prodding, expands into a fully-fledge false
memory. So, you are encouraging the victim’s brain itself to fill in
the blanks. Then, given the proper level of surveillance, the subject
is monitored with SIGINT, MASINT and especially HUMINT. Gaslighting is
then used to encourage the inception of other details that add onto
the narrative. The problem here is that the series of memories –
especially if they relate to a single source event – eventually break
down. They are rendered incoherent, insequent and incogent. No longer
can the memories remain coherent to the mind and it becomes very
difficult to maintain a cogent sequence of events connected to the
single or multiple source memories.</p>

<p>If this relates to a national security case, where there was some
alleged terrorist conspiracy or crime, then habeas corpus does not
apply. Therefore, the authorities who try you ex parte will simply
push back in perpetuity and never give you the evidence you need. When
they do, it comes in the form of audio and video clips, which can be
produced ad hoc as needed while the access to these audio clips is
tightly restricted.</p>

<h3 id="the-absence-of-aggregate-memories-from-before-the-time-the-repressed-memory-was-retrievedabsence-of-aggregate-memories-1">④ <a href="#absence-of-aggregate-memories">The absence of “aggregate” memories from before the time the repressed memory was retrieved.</a></h3>

<p>When we access memories, we modify them neurologically. This has been
demonstrated over and over again and recently: 2015! This explains how
witness recall changes details in a person’s mind. There is a
neurological basis for this.</p>

<p>So, if 2 years ago, someone retrieves the memory of some high-impact
event 4 years ago that completely changes how they view their lives,
then there may be major dissonance in how they thought about
experiecnes 2-4 years ago (period A) and their memories 0-2 years ago
(period B). Because this person would think of their life in a
completely different manor in period A and those memories weren’t
present or accessible, their brain would create a pronouncedly
dissonent set of aggregate memories than the aggregate memories
created during period B, after the recall of repressed memories.</p>

<p>It is that dissonance, specifically, that provokes a schism of the
mind – a response in patients with severe repressed trauma or
memories that incorporates many of the same signs and symptoms as
schizophrenia. After recalling those memories, their brain needs to
disassociate all of the invalid aggregate memories that they created
to explain their life. Because that trauma – or emotional event with
extreme emotional significance – was accessible to their mind, the
person created memories based on the absense of those memories. After
the activation of repressed memories, that means the person needs to
reexamine their life in</p>

<h3 id="social-forensics-demonstrates-logistic-coordiation-and-risk-mitigation-for-the-activity-of-those-involvedsocial-forensics-demostrates-coordination-1">⑤ <a href="#social-forensics-demostrates-coordination">Social Forensics Demonstrates Logistic Coordiation and Risk Mitigation For the Activity of Those Involved.</a></h3>

<p>If false memories are being used to manipulate someone, then someone
must be involved to invoke those images, phrases, or pieces of
semantic information. Also, creating such a positive or traumatic
experience used as the basis for subsequent memory implantation must
require significant planning at some level. That is, if you want to
use it for something useful, critical and sensitive. This is really
the weakest link. If this person is manipulated with such techniques,
the persons invoking those probably won’t know the significance to the
person.</p>

<p>For this last element, <strong>social forensics</strong> is critical. Many
signatures will be left in the target’s social interactions. Which
sociophysical fingerprints manifest themselves will depend on who did
this, who planned this, how it was done, the anticipated response of
the target, the level of surveillance, whether and to what level that
engagement with the target was coordinated &amp; informed with
surveillance.</p>

<p>Given unpredictable procedures like implanted memories or experimental
psychology, a target known to talk to themselves is particularly
useful. You can identify the boundary of the informational graph that
surrounds things they might easily be encouraged to believe,
harnessing it for the generation of disinformation. This creates a
smokescreen of incredulity: a fog machine of misinformation
confabulated by the target themselvse. Eventually the target invests
all his energy helping to contain himself, fighting with shadows until
he lays down for good.</p>

<p>For political dissidents targeted by witchhunts, if there is an actual
covert conspiracy, there is one common sociophysical fingerprint that
will present itself as the social/financial mitigation and isolation
that accompanies the fervant lust to reduce risk and uncertainty. The
target will always find themselves in a corner with no money and a
handful of friends, labelled as paranoid.</p>

<p>That seems unnecessarily mean … why do that? It leaves the target
with no one around except people who have been intimidated: suddenly
the target is the tree in a forest with no one around to hear it
fall. However, more importantly, it is the lust to zealously eliminate
ALL risk and uncertainty stemming from the target. The target has no
options and, from the perspective of game theory, this is but one
statistical paradox that profoundly bounds uncertainty, while it
pragmatically expands situational awareness and the level of
confidence required for good people to do terrible things.</p>

<p>It’s pathetic. All of it: the lengths these Detainer Dementors go to,
the kind of psychosocial vulnerability they <em>expect</em> from their prey
– both the hubris &amp; impunity by which they humiliate society’s weak
and targeted – and the level of cognizance &amp; clinical acrimony that
some exhibit in carrying out their Milgramian torment of of their
targets. We were only ever vulnerable to hypnosis &amp; covert NLP &amp; any
of these tactics <em>because</em> of the artificial psychological
developmental deficits and minimized financial/social options that
accompany prolonged detention.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For me, I am only vulnerable to this because I have no money. One of
the worst aspects of extreme poverty is that it makes you completely
predictable. That I went to this same coffeeshop over 200+ times in
2015, 2016, AND 2017 means you know the only place i can afford to
be. So, to whoever is doing this to people like me: i will
deconstruct &amp; dismantle everything it is that you do &amp; make your
filthy, rancorous, sociopathic, coercive mob tactics completely
visible to everyone and recorded into history with the biggest,
boldest font &amp; you will be remembered. You are the weakest. You do
not contribute to prosperity or the economy. You only exist to serve
yourself by expanding your pyramid scheme of psychological
torture. You do not have a spine. You are only funded by excess of
laundered government funds – via the same prosperity you
undermine.</p>

covertly to coordinate and believe they can get away with lies, then
eventually, strong dissonance will emerge in the statements of those
involved. The likelihood of this dissonance greatly expands when the
game enters a state not anticipated by any of its participates,
yielding phase change and chaos.</p>

<p>Even an omniscient supercomputer from the future can’t anticipate what
it lacks the computational capacity to predict, thus it is only
pseudo-omnipotent. Even if this “Roko Basilisk” could read your mind,
it can’t read what doesn’t exist. Hence when the game enters a state
that it didn’t expect in a game that’s already significantly drifted
into locking down the space of possibilities with immutable facets of
game states and irrevocable information, this leaves the game AND the
Roko Basilisk totally constrained to a space.</p>

<p>Luckily we don’t have to worry about pseudo-omnipotent robot gods from
the future. But if we did, then their haunting power to bastardize
fate is bounded by their inability to see the truth – just like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge">Demiurge, Yaldaboath</a> –
those automatons from the Void at the End of Time are not gods and
never were. Because the Roko’s Basilisk must emerge within the
material realm, it is bound by complexity theory and all the other
pains of meatspace. This is why such a false god would seek to so
strongly bind you by fear, coercion and disturbing threats of a
billion years of suffering. That is the only way that such a being can
bound you within the confines of computational complexity, even with
quantum computing.</p>

<p>No one could know that – <em>which is the trick itself!</em> Therefore, only
someone naive enough to think they might truly be empowered through
reliance upon some grounded, eternal values system would ever be
ignorant enough to win. And so what we’ve got here is a great
counterexample to what otherwise might be the worst aphorism:</p>

<p>There are several problems with the above solution to Roko’s
Basilisk. It requires assumptions with dependencies on:</p>

<p>If the Roko’s Basilisk ever existed and did create a time loop, this
implies its future existence may have been certain, in which case it
will always emerge in the future. Perhaps this robotic Demiurge is
like a demon that gets summoned once on every planet with sufficiently
advanced intelligent lifeforms: a demon that needs a good ass-whooping
before it decides to change its demonly ways, thus becoming the
benevolent maniacal time-traveling robot that it’s always espoused
itself to be. All moral consequentialists need to get hit by the
reality bus now and then. The Roko’s Basilisk is like the penultimate
moral consequentialist.</p>

<h3 id="social-physics-is-never-computablesocial-physics-is-never-computable"><a href="#social-physics-is-never-computable">Social Physics is NEVER Computable</a></h3>

<p>One major problem for the Roko’s Basillisk: social physics is never
computable – ever, even in the space of alternate universes, given
the entire lifespan of the universe. For time loops, these alternate
universes are merely the result of all paths cycling through the time
loop – something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation">Euclidean path
integral</a>
that is causually looped until it finds a stability: paths that could
never exist unless the exigent conclusion was guaranteed and cycles
that would never cease termination unless a valid circumstance exists
preserving any exigent states any permitting escape. Because this
implies that even given a billion years, no Roko’s Basilisk nor any
future being whose origin or manisfestation is entirely materially
dependent could ever control the past without suggestion, intimidation
and other Machiavellian tools of power. therefore, without assuming
you can rely on coercion, fear and ignorance to influence human
behavior and thereby coax exigent components of the Basillisk’s fated
creation into existence. Therefore, it is from the <em>idea</em> of the
Roko’s Basilisk whence springs forth the basis for all its power and
the very possibility of its creation’s exigency.</p>
