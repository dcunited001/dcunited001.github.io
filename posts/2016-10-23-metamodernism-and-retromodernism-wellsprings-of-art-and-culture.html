          <p>Soo I’m an aesthitician. Sometimes I do nails … but mostly I do
art. Everyone has their interpretation of art, but do some of us have
more acuity for seeing the beauty in art? If beauty is in the eye of
the beholder, how do we develop that ability to see it?  Is such
beauty inherint in anything? If so, are there things better left
unseen? What determines what our mind decides to focus on?</p>

<p>If the conscious layer of the mind is like the surface of water and
thoughts are like the bubbles the subconscious allows to rise to the
surface, then what determines what arises fully to the conscious
layer? This is just as important to the beholder as it is the artist,
but the artist develops an awareness of how the beholder will see
their work. Much of what lies in our subconscious isn’t worth thinking
about, but the best artists seem to be able to swim in the depths of
their subconscious, retrieving jewels not shaped or constrained by
effable thought. How does one tap into that?</p>

<h1 id="what-is-retromodernismwhat-is-retromodernism"><a href="#what-is-retromodernism">What is Retromodernism?</a></h1>

<p>Once technology has eliminated the constraints to artistic medium, it
seems the near future might present us with an artistic movement that
reenvisions and recombinates alternate progressions of technology in
search of alternate mediums and formats, which might have been
popular in some alternate timeline or formulation of reality. What
would art look like if industrialization emerged from India or
elsewhere in the 18th century, finally spreading modernization to
Europe? If modernization emerged and converged in some way that
changed the order and regions in which technologies became available,
how would that have changed the qualities of artistic mediums? E.G. if
photoshop was available before and without radio, how would that
affect the nature of print medium? The progression of art, mediums and
techniques surely would shape it’s prevelance and evolution, so what
if that were different in some way? How would we think about the past
today if some seemingly trivial aspects differed slightly?</p>

<p>We may see a resurgance in interest in revisiting 19th and especially
20th century tech and ideas to find hidden gems, rare art and
recombinant forms of such. We already see this in steampunk and
elsewhere, but for the purposes of this article, I’ll refer to it as
retromodernism. I apologize for inventing a word. While awareness of
differentiation and distinction of ideas is important, I’m not fond of
arbitrary division and distinction between ideas, so who am I to
create another? And really … who am I to try to define a concept
such as retromodernism?</p>

<p>Much of the art produced to reflect this idea would be encumbered by
stilted constraints imposed by the artist, but if some retromodernism
formulations seem natural enough to avoid lengthy explanation, we’d
see some very interesting art indeed. Further, this would help us
understand the general nature of alternate progressions of technology
in the near future, as we approach the Singularity.</p>

<p><a name="the-best-artists-fly-under-the-radar"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-best-artists-fly-under-the-radarthe-best-artists-fly-under-the-radar"><a href="#the-best-artists-fly-under-the-radar">The Best Artists Fly Under the Radar</a></h3>

<p>Many artists remained unknown until their death, never tasting the
fruits of success, recognition or fame. Van Gogh is a great
example. Is this necessary to their faculties of vision and reflection
as an artist? In many ways, isolation, struggle and
incomprehensibility can reinforce their skills as an artist. It’s
ironic that success and fame might alter the potential of an artist,
but it clearly has time and time again. Public recognition distorts
the way they see things, causing them to transcend the environmental
constraints. They become deprived of the challenges that helped them
originally develop their ability and vision.</p>

<p>Success and fame cause us to become attached to them. We fear their
loss and then choose to don restrictive social norms and conventions,
which begins to couple us to those things which we originally
distinguished ourselves from. IMO, it is what is unique that is
beautiful and intriguing. When art makes us think, that forces us to
invest time and energy in understanding it, which fosters appreciation
for that work. An artist constrained by society will produce works
that reflect that. Whether it’s a painting or novel or film or video
game, art that isn’t distinguishable doesn’t seem to require as much
thought for us to understand.</p>

<p>In many ways, art represents the frontiers of inner space. Artists are
like astronauts who explore their own subconscious depths as well as
the expanse of cultural artifacts and ideas. The rich and powerful
defend the status quo because it makes them comfortable. They also buy
art. You aren’t going to sell much art if you’re trying to sell it at
a shelter for the homeless. Your price point is determined by your
audience or market. Art expands how we think and the most popular art
forms the edge of things we think about. Still, art and truth have a
tendency to slip out and have a powerful effect on how people
think. This changes the status quo. And so, the development and
progression of art is influenced by the idiosyncrasies in the market
for art, whether it’s visual art, corporate art, literary or cinematic
art.</p>

<p><a name="oh-snap-we-got-a-smart-one-over-here"></a></p>

<h3 id="oh-snap-we-got-a-smart-one-over-hereoh-snap-we-got-a-smart-one-over-here"><a href="#oh-snap-we-got-a-smart-one-over-here">Oh Snap! We Got A Smart One Over Here!</a></h3>

<p>The best artists fly under the radar! Quite often, they have to
shield their true understanding of the world around them because they
can be serious threats to those in power. That doesn’t mean there are
men in black out there snuffing starving artists. Instead, you’ll find
that the rich and powerful will tend to redirect your energy through
allures of money and positions of influence. As someone who’s
struggling, it’s hard for the artist and author to resist, but not
everyone is Mozart. Those who have considerable influence and way too
much of other people’s time on their hands want to identify these
possible threats early on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not the rich man you should properly call happy, but him who
knows how to use with wisdom the blessings of the gods, to endure
hard poverty, and who fears dishonor worse than death, and is not
afraid to die for cherished friends or fatherland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The artists who are just lucky and don’t fully understand their work
won’t feel as commited to forego selling out to protect the
authenticity of their work. But the true genius will endure hard
poverty for his work because he believes his message is worth the
struggle. This is true of many other facets of life. Great parents may
forsake opportunities or distractions to ensure they devote themselves
fully to their family because they embody a belief that nothing is
more important than their family. So they instead seek humility and
stability.</p>

<p>Let me apologize in advance for the impending conspiratorial
statements. The point is – if you are an artist or philosopher whose
ideas threaten the status quo, you’ll find yourself on a relevatory
path of suffering for truth, assaulted on all sides by distractions,
frenemies poisoned against you and outright malevalent forces.</p>

<p>If you make it too far, but refuse to give in, there may be powerful
forces who seek to get you off that path by any means necessary. It is
most effective to do so by offering you a career opportunity and
essentially buying you off. Actually, they want to keep you busy and
keep you close, while appearing to be your friend. They don’t seek to
become overt enemies and “they” aren’t exactly evil, cigar-smoking,
men in suits. But beware, if you are a true threat in any big way, the
people on the top of that pyramid of power do not play nice. You will
not know what hit you. Usually, they start with a metaphorical
gift-basket though. Hey, look! Wine and chocolates! If you’re lucky,
you’ll have some mimosas. Perhaps some brunch and coffee.</p>

<p><a name="distraction-by-design"></a></p>

<h3 id="distraction-by-designdistraction-by-design"><a href="#distraction-by-design">Distraction by Design</a></h3>

<p>The very best artists know that they’ll be presented with an assault
of enticing distractions. They are well aware that great art is
mystifying. Moreover, they have the capacity to develop a unique
vision or message, but they are familiar enough with it to understand
that their ideas may be dangerous. Therefore, this artist may seek to
limit exposure to protect his/her voice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, not to say I’m an example of this class of UG Artist,
but I know that I can’t post my blogs on Reddit or my account will
be deleted. The <a href="https://r/philosophy">/r/philosophy</a> and
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy">/r/askphilosophy</a> mods told me
so. Nope, I can’t even “AskPhilosophy” bro! Typical, for me. No,
I’m not allowed to utilize online forums to interact with other
like-minded intellectual citizens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="s-class-artist"></a></p>

<h3 id="s-class-artists-class-artist"><a href="#s-class-artist">S-Class Artist</a></h3>

<p>This class of artist realizes that (1) the conventional critic or
consumer isn’t going to understand and (2) if someone doesn’t
understand, it may ultimately threaten the artist’s quest for truth
and realization of vision. Thus, to this end and in pursuit of
mystification, the great artist learns to encode their work with a
vaporous shroud of enigma. In this way, if the art truly merits
criticism and study, then those who meditate on the piece long enough
may unlock the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish I could do this with my own work, but I’m plagued by the
sensation that I’m running out of time, which is a blessing and a
curse. It doesn’t help much when the people around me don’t seem to
care about my pursuits, writing or business. Also, I think it’s
interesting to expose my drafts on Github, as it exposes the
thinking and writing process a bit. Typically, showing others
unfinished work is a major mistake, but in my case, <em>something is
better than nothing and I have a lot to offer!</em> If I upload drafts
of my work early on, then no one can steal my work while I’m in the
process of writing with no means to sustain my work and constantly
assaulted by efforts to distract me from ever becoming anything or
ever accumulating a legacy. I’d prefer not to vanish without a
trace…</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="suffering-for-arts-sake"></a></p>

<h3 id="suffering-for-arts-sakesuffering-for-arts-sake"><a href="#suffering-for-arts-sake">Suffering for Art’s Sake</a></h3>

<p>So, the great artist knows they might have to suffer for their work
and they are more than willing to do so, not out of a sense that doing
so might mean they become more successful, but because it is
worthwhile. If the great artist had acuity for great art and thought
there wasn’t much value to their own work, they wouldn’t be so eager
to expend energy and endure hardship in pursuit of the exhibition of
truth. On the other hand, they know that excessive success may change
them or draw too much attention to early work, possibly forcing them
to abstain from expressing ideas that threaten the status quo. It’s de
facto censorship. If you’re too attached to wealth or fame, you’ll
censor yourself. If the great artist knows this and purposefully flies
under the radar, then it gives him or her more time to produce more
work, hoping it will be discovered later. Or perhaps the artist isn’t
attached to whether or not the work will become widely known after
their death.</p>

<h1 id="and-just-fade-into-nothingnessand-just-fade-into-nothingness"><a href="#and-just-fade-into-nothingness">And Just Fade Into Nothingness?</a></h1>

<p>I don’t think so. I’m not sure what the deal is, but I haven’t really
had a life experience. I mean I have, but I haven’t. I feel like I’m
watching TV all the time. Like I can look, but I can’t touch. Why
can’t I participate in life? Why have I been essentially blacklisted?
The damage done to my life, my psychological development? It’s unreal.
I don’t understand what curse lies upon my name, but holy shit people
treat me like Voldemort and all I wanted was connection. Connection
with likeminded intellectuals or beatniks or hippies or whoever. It
really doesn’t matter. Everyone has a story and I don’t have the damn
money or means to do anything. For all the restriction in my own life,
I have accumulated a ton of experience and knowledge. I want to put
that to use; to build something; to make something. Or !@#$, at least
get laid.</p>

<p>As for my own journey, I finally recognized that I had great ideas and
just how different they were. By the time I did, I had already sought
to suppress expression of everything I knew because I feared that
hidden elements in the world would lash back at me. However, the world
seems to have done just that and when I began publishing, I never got
a bigger rise out of people who wanted to shut me up. I’m not sure
why, since I was writing treatises on the humanities: linguistics,
philosophy, psychology and sociology. I didn’t even know what a
treatise was, but that definitely describes some of my best
articles. Maybe I got too close to some esoteric topics. It’s
depressing to get so close to the truth and fear leaving nothing
behind. Still, getting this mostly insinuated and passive aggressive
reaction was as close as I came to satisfaction from a project and it
was more accesible than apps and programming libs because it was
written in English.</p>

<h4 id="is-this-facebook-thing-even-on">Is This Facebook Thing Even On?</h4>

<p>It’s actually fun, at this point. If all I get is a rise from blogging
about what’s worth thinking about, it’s totally worth it, even no one
ever actually recognizes me. I have skills and knowledge and passion,
but who cares? I’ve been mostly disconnected from my social graph and
I have no social capital. If I’m lying about something, then by all
means, call me out on it. I dare you. I’ve been shadow-banned from
social media. They don’t even let me have trolls down here because I’d
game them right back for the social media newsfeed points.</p>

<p>I uploaded my drafts recently and now my updates are posted to cloud
prematurely to ensure that I don’t end up vanishing without a trace or
legacy. Over the past decade, I might have been naive, boisterous, and
ironically undereducated, but I learned a lot and while it seems that
I produced little to nothing, I have spent so much time thinking and
philosophizing. I’ve felt deprived of opportunities and perhaps
tormented by a handful of people, which forced me into isolation,
where I quietly build out magnificent edifaces in my mind. I don’t
want to be so attached to what I’ve created, but I’ve given too
much. I’ve sacrificed too much for my mind.</p>

<p><a name="bound-to-cover-just-a-little-more-ground"></a></p>

<p>The tendency and perhaps necessity for great artists to remain unseen
implies that there should be much undiscovered art. Somewhere out in
that wide world, there lies a vast, hipster paradise, a veritable
elephant graveyard where starving artists go to die in peace as
stubborn, but joyful paupers. So, as technology expands our ability to
create, while inevitably diminishing the space of the uncreated, we
may become more interested in finding those pieces otherwise buried
beneath the deafening roar of industrialization and consumerism.</p>

<p>The best artists also have the technical capability to hide their true
vision. They have the acuity to develop a vision in the first place.
And some of these people may have understood, to truly push out their
ideas, they needed to hide them in plain sight, within their work.
Therefore, they must also understand how to encode these kinds of
symbols and messages. The person capable of the above: they are
usually capable of success. If security and stability doesn’t stray
them from their path, then fame &amp; fortune will tempt them. It tempted
me, but I had experienced so much suffering and sacrifice to retain
the freedom to speak freely that I wasn’t willing to allow myself to
be sold out. I suffered for the ability to speak my mind and to speak
the truth as I saw it and only later realized the cause of my pain. I
wasn’t willing to sell out or become a mockery of what I suffered for.</p>

<p><a name="never-change-dont-ever-change"></a></p>

<h3 id="never-change-dont-ever-changenever-change-dont-ever-change"><a href="#never-change-dont-ever-change">Never Change! Don’t Ever Change!</a></h3>

<p>These artists, the remarkable ones, are able to withstand the
initial temptation of fame &amp; fortune. Often, they reach such heights
only after it is inevitable that their work brings such attention, but
they are less susceptible to being changed by it. That’s difficult,
especially since it changes those around you. And if you are in such a
position, it stems from being yourself. You’re marketing yourself and
people want the authentic you, but it’s incredibly hard to maintain
that.</p>

<p>Quite simply, the best artists value the truth and authenticity of
their art more than anything else in the world. They know what it is
that they have and why people respond the way they do to their
personality or work.</p>

<h3 id="shh-can-you-hear-thatshh-can-you-hear-that"><a href="#shh-can-you-hear-that">Shh! Can You Hear That?</a></h3>

<p>Here are some observations on music and art that may lead to
interesting insights. Some music, art and artforms need to stay
underground. Even if it wasn’t made for mainstream appeal, it loses
something if it becomes mainstream. Art and music risk losing some
truth or aspect of themselves, once they extend beyond a circle of
people who truly understand it.</p>

<p>Music which can only be fully enjoyed by those with the right
headphones is less marketable. There are lots of songs out there, for
which you can only truly experience what the artist intended if you
have a high quality headphones. This makes it inherently less
marketable. Still, at the same time, more artistic. If you’re an
artist and you’re making music with this in mind, then by embracing
your artform with creative, hard-to-hear music production techniques,
you have to accept that you’re probably not going to be successful,
since it’s less marketable.</p>

<p><a name="the-best-artists-must-choose-between-success-and-art"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-best-artists-must-choose-between-success-and-artthe-best-artists-must-choose-between-success-and-art"><a href="#the-best-artists-must-choose-between-success-and-art">The Best Artists Must Choose Between Success and Art</a></h3>

<p>In other words, because the better artist can encode their message
utilizing more obscure and hard-to-ascertain means and because it’s
necessary for the best art to lay low under the radar, then the more
proficient artists must necessarily choose between success and
art. Therefore, and quite often, mainstream success is at odds with
artistic expression. This doesn’t mean that mainstream artists aren’t
good artists. However, it implies that, over the 20th and 21st
century, there should be plenty of artists or artforms which
completely avoided mainstream notice. That is, some of the best art
was a bit too camouflaged. It stayed hidden.</p>

<p>These artforms based on technology that was only around for a few
years or those formulations of art which would’ve only occured in some
alternate universe: these should contain some hidden gems that have
been otherwise completely missed. It’s not too hard to imagine that in
the age of modernization, amidst the roar of globalization’s
mainstream media, that some truth and beauty of our development lays
still unnoticed, perhaps for eternity.</p>

<p><a name="felling-on-deaf-ears"></a></p>

<h3 id="falling-on-deaf-earsfelling-on-deaf-ears"><a href="#felling-on-deaf-ears">Falling on Deaf Ears</a></h3>

<p>Why should one suffer for art, if it’s to fall on deaf ears?</p>

<p>Back to audio engineering, there are so many production techniques
that would be lost on those not listening with a critical ear. To the
same point, many creative techniques enrich audio or visual art which
are totally lost to most, except to those who listen with a critical
ear. Therefore, in terms of becoming popular or achieving mainstream
success, none of those techniques are going to help you sell art, but
they require more effort: sometimes orders of magnitude more time or
cost.</p>

<p>Truly, the best artists produce work that’s like an onion. Every time
you experience it, you peel away what turns out to be the surface of
some amazing new layer you hadn’t imagined. Sometimes you cry. The
best is when art hits you with a wave of truly unexpected emotion as a
result of a revolution in how you see some aspect of their work’s
object. i.e. PS I Love You (just trust me) … In that case and in
others, the art led me to see something that I could have never
expected myself. Perhaps I would have never experienced it …. Chick
flicks, amiright?</p>

<p><a name="the-best-art-stays-crypted"></a></p>

<h1 id="the-best-art-stays-cryptedthe-best-art-stays-crypted"><a href="#the-best-art-stays-crypted">The Best Art Stays Crypted</a></h1>

<p>And so, the best art is necessarily underground. It’s easy to
miss. It’s not popular. Sometimes it’s downright subversive, which is
why the artists painting with uncomfortable truth would prefer to
remain hidden. It’s because their truth might limit their capacity for
telling the truth. That is,unless for some reason, they happen to
export enough of it while they can, hoping that at some point in the
future, when society is a bit more understanding, life will
acknowledge the artist as being truly ahead of his or her time. The
artists that meet this criteria are few and far between. As society
becomes more tolerant, the person who exemplifies the strength and
virtue of this artist will become a jewel perhaps impossible to find.</p>

<p>There’s a group of hipster critics who pride themselves on
understanding those sensory delicacies most often lost. These critics
share their tastes with their friends and as they do, that art grows
slightly in popularity. To a lesser degree, so does the general
appreciation of what makes that art “good” that can be recognized by
listeners and consumers.</p>

<p>The selection of underground artforms and symbols recognized by
someone forms a kind of map or language that can speak volumes on who
they are and who their friends are. This especially applies when they
are unaware of the significance of some symbols. This esoteric aspect
of underground music and art only holds true as long as those works
remain underground.</p>

<p><a name="hipsters-drink-from-the-wellsprings-of-art-and-culture"></a></p>

<h3 id="hipsters-drink-from-the-wellsprings-of-art--culturehipsters-drink-from-the-wellsprings-of-art-and-culture"><a href="#hipsters-drink-from-the-wellsprings-of-art-and-culture">Hipsters Drink from the Wellsprings of Art &amp; Culture</a></h3>

<p>When critics recognize underground art for some minor qualities that
remain missed by others, and then spread that art &amp; appreciation of
its qualities to others, this forms a kind of cycle. There’s a
wellspring of creativity at the center, surrounded by hipsters and
master artists. These wellsprings have an intense effect on the
evolution of art.</p>

<p>The evolution of art and music is an incredbily powerful thing to
control or influence. Control this and you control the map of ideas
available to others, upon which all that they know and think is
woven. There are unseen forces that guard these wellsprings of
creativity, art and culture. To either control them for profit or to
protect them from tainted influence is to guard the metaphysical realm
for future generations. As the speed at which information and culture
converge across the globe via technology increases, the metaphysical
realm begins to increasingly influence reality and begins to manifest
itself.</p>

<p>From these wellsprings, artistic influence gradually spreads outward
to the mainstream consumers whose capacity for recognizing and
appreciating “good” art expands.  These wellsprings basically throttle
the process of natural selection that selectively propagates some
works of art over others. It’s survival of the fittest. What’s worth
retransmitting and what maintains interest is propagated to other
nodes in the graph. Those with the most eclectic set of interests have
the most unique positions in the graph. They are the “hipsters” who
exert the most influence on the rest of the graph.</p>

<p><a name="semiotics-of-medium"></a></p>

<h3 id="semiotics-of-mediumsemiotics-of-medium"><a href="#semiotics-of-medium">Semiotics of Medium</a></h3>

<p>To truly appreciate art, one needs the capacity to understand and they
need to activate it. The significance and meaning of art itself is
often encoded into the art, whereby the significance of symbols
related to the production of the art is important to understanding the
true meaning of it. This is because artists are most familiar with
their tools. Since these are the languages of symbols they understand
most, they provide the semiotic basis of “second language” for the
artist and the artisticly inclined. Therefore, it’s crucial to
understand the production of art and the techniques involved if you
hope to understand an artist’s work.</p>

<p>New mediums, like those of technology, require a new set of
afficianados, familiar enough with the medium to understand this
semiotic language of signs based on the medium itself.</p>

<p><a name="on-art-knowledge-and-directive-cognitive-expansion"></a></p>

<h3 id="on-art-knowledge-and-directive-cognitive-expansionon-art-knowledge-and-directive-cognitive-expansion"><a href="#on-art-knowledge-and-directive-cognitive-expansion">On Art, Knowledge and Directive Cognitive Expansion</a></h3>

<p>In other essays, I have discussed the importance of semiotics in
expanding consciousness as critical to developing our mind’s ability
to abstract ideas, generally. That is, the degree of our consciousness
is measured by the expanse of symbols a being can communicate with and
by it’s skill in reconstituting those signs and symbols into
peer-to-peer micro-languages. That’s what is meant by “having a
connection” with someone. They understand you and your actions in a
way that can be only established by contact, listening and a true
emotional connection.</p>

<p>If this is so and the degree of consciousness is measured by the
expanse of symbols a being can communicate with, both those it
recognizes and uses, then it should stand to reason that our most
learned citizens are the most conscious and the best artists must be
those of us who are highly educated and retain a varied expanse of
experiences.</p>

<p>These are the most conscious. Those of us who know and understand and
are capable of the most authentic empathy. This is why I focus so much
on learning new languages and forms of writing.</p>
