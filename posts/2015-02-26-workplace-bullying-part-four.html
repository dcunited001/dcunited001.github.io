<h2 id="same-team-same-team">Same Team! <em>SAME TEAM!</em></h2>

<p>These tools will help you, but you will notice sometimes that these
really really piss a bully off.  Be warned - some battles aren’t worth
fighting. Your energy and talents may be better suited elsewhere.  Of
course, that’s not to say you shouldn’t stand up for yourself.</p>

<p>For those of you who have read the previous articles in this series
and still doubt me, then how is it possible that I know what I do,
with no formal business or managerial training? And how am I able to
describe these situations and scenarios so accurately?  You can only
learn these things by being taught or going through them yourself.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/little-miss-sunshine.jpg" alt="Little Miss Sunshine" /></p>

<h4 id="little-miss-sunshine">Little Miss Sunshine</h4>

<p>People aren’t naturally like this.  There’s this really interesting
scene at the end of Little Miss Sunshine about learning hard lessons
in life and one of the characters references Marcel Proust’s writing.
Basically, the paradox discussed in Little Miss Sunshine is that being
blissfully happy precludes personal development, so you either have to
choose to <strong>love the struggle</strong> or <em>be happy and content with where
you are.</em> * <strong>But you can’t have both.</strong> *</p>

<p>Or so Proust critics say anyways. I have my doubts about these
conclusions.  Why should we not be happy while we seek personal
development? Why is life such that pain is the best teacher? Is this
true? I hope not, since the scars often hurt more than the pain
itself.</p>

<h3 id="coincidentally-i-happen-to-be-writing-a-marcel-prousthttpenwikipediaorgwikiinsearchoflosttime-size-work-with-this-series-of-articles">Coincidentally, I happen to be <strong>writing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time">Marcel Proust</a> size work</strong> with this series of articles.</h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/bazinga.jpg" alt="Bazinga Ball Pit" /></p>

<p>It’s really only through experiencing this pain that I’ve learned
about this stuff.  While it hurts, it has made me stronger.  I truly
hope everyone reading this understands why you don’t put people
through these situations.  And I’m assuming that many of the people
taking part in this either don’t understand what they are doing, what
it’s like to be there, or how it affects someone, ultimately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Forgive them, for they know not what they do.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-makes-it-hard-to-fight-back">What Makes It Hard to Fight Back?</h2>

<p>To your manager, it’s going to seem like you’re whining, unless you
have a solid case with well documented examples of clearly negative
behavior.  If you go to them too many times, you’re going to burn
through your “favors” and exhaust your “asks” with them.</p>

<p>Even then, your manager is going to prefer that you resolve issues
with teammates on your own, without requiring intervention.  A manager
doesn’t want to get between two teammates to resolve personal
relationship problems, unless it is clearly necessary.  And because of
the nature of passive agressive behavior, it’s hard to demonstrate
this clearly.  Ultimately, they will do it because a manager wants to
stand up for their employees and wants to provide the best work
environment they can.  But if your argument doesn’t stick, you might
find yourself worse off.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ultimately, I don’t want to feel like I am at odds with the people I
work with.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-needz-moar-light">★ Needz Moar Light!</h3>

<p>When everyone knows what’s up, manipulations fall apart.  These people
operate in darkness.  People aren’t stupid and they don’t just fall
for anything.  So, usually, the more details you bring to light, the
less capable a bully or sociopath is able to manipulate.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/the-more-you-know.png" alt="The More You Know" /></p>

<p>Obviously, this doesn’t work for everything, as there are many
situations that people would like to keep private and for good reason.
However, <strong>these bullies are going to use that as an excuse.</strong> They’re
going to prefer to hide their plans, hide their intentions and cover
their tracks.  They are going to be duplicitous and various people
will develop different ideas of what is truly going on.  You need to
minimize this.</p>

<p>How do you do this?  Effective communication.  CC the relevant people
on appropraite email threads.  Make sure credit for tasks is publicly
given to the right people.  Reward people in front of others, so
everyone knows how people have contributed to the teams efforts.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/to-change-a-lightbulb.jpg" alt="To Change A Lightbulb" /></p>

<p>There’s no need to be sneaky about it.  Avoid making criticizing this
person behind their back, but don’t be afraid to reach out to someone
you trust.  No one likes someone who talks behind someone’s back and
you’ll basically be doing the same thing as them.  Remember, it’s not
fair to deplore someone without giving them a chance to correct their
behavior.  Effective communication doesn’t mean tattling to your
manager everytime this person does something.  You just need to be
more aware and make sure everyone’s on the same page.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-bring-the-situation-to-your-manager-and-teams-attention">★ Bring the Situation to Your Manager and Team’s Attention</h3>

<p>Tread carefully when doing this: it may not yet be appropriate.  The
fact that it’s harder to bring in our manager is one ongoing problem
that you may face: your manager is really counting on you to work with
the team and for you to mostly take care of any relationship issues
that arise.  You really need a strong case to bring something to the
manager’s attention.  And if it is your manager, you’re probably
!@#$’ed. GLHF.</p>

<h2 id="x2605-how-should-we-use-the-socratic-methodhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisocraticmethod">★ How Should We Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic Method</a>?</h2>

<p>The Socratic Method is perhaps your most valuable tool, besides
conversation.  Be careful, the Socratic Method isn’t appropriate
everywhere – the military is a good example of a place where
questioning everything is a bad thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the Socratic Method?</strong> It’s a method of rhetoric where you
ask questions that elucidate your opponents beliefs and likely next
actions.  You can use this to pigeon hole them, if you can just see
a few steps ahead.  If you can ask questions that introduce the
conditions you need to win a debate or force your opponent to take a
certain argument, then you win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/socrates-1.gif" alt="Socratic Method 1" /></p>

<p>It was popularized by Socrates in
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1497/1497-h/1497-h.htm">Plato’s Republic</a>
and you see this especially in Chapter One, in the debate against
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasymachus">Thrasymachus</a>.
Thrasymachus asserts that <strong>strength <em>is</em> justice</strong>, which really
kicks off the whole book.  Socrate’s uses his annoyingly effective
methods of reasoning and rhetoric to make an argument someone thought
was worth writing a book about.  Socrates is killed several years
later.  Probably because he just won’t stop asking questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, you should read Plato’s Republic if you haven’t. This
book should be required reading in middle school.  It’s not that
important – it’s just the foundation of all Western philosophy.
You can either struggle understanding the Western world around you
– or you can read the book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Against workplace bullying, the Socratic Method <strong>works best when when
used subtly</strong>. It will at least allow you to better read this person.
You can’t just go directly questioning everything.  You need to be
indirect about it and ask questions, the answers of which may belie
their intentions – in front of everyone or in private.</p>

<p>However, the goal is not necessarily to bust this guy out in front of
everyone, unless the situation gets to that point.  The goal is
actually to learn more about what this person is thinking about doing
and by asking the right questions, you can block them from ever making
shitty moves in the first place.  Or you might lead them into
contradicting themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s kinda like jeopardy.  A philosophical form of rhetorical jeopardy …</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/jeopardy.jpg" alt="Celebrity Jeopardy" /></p>

<h4 id="i-really-just-wanted-to-use-this-image-lulz">I really just wanted to use this image lulz</h4>

<p>Questions with Yes/No answers aren’t really useful here, though they
can be.  Ask questions which require a somewhat detailed response and
see how your opponent responds.  Does their answer mesh with what you
suspect to be true?  Did they try to hide their answer or change the
subject by wrestling control of the conversation from you?</p>

<h3 id="x2605-make-a-mental-note-of-it--or-actually-make-notes">★ Make a Mental Note of It.  Or Actually Make Notes.</h3>

<p>Observe Manipulative Behavior Discerningly.  Don’t Act Quite Yet.</p>

<p>Remember, it’s important not to get swept up in the moment.  You could
be mistaken.  You also need to demonstrate understanding and
compassion yourself.  Also, it is in your own incentive not to respond
so quickly: doing so could backfire or could prevent the person from
exhibiting more of their negative behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, this is incredibly important for someone conducting job
interviews.  You want to see how this person behaves on their own:
they’re going to have control on the job, aren’t they?  Therefore,
provide some direction and see where they go with it.  I’ve always
noticed that interviewers do this.  At least, the better ones do.
Do you want to work for someone that doesn’t provide you some
autonomy?  Do you want to work for someone who isn’t a good judge of
character?  Starting to get off topic there, but those are good
points to reflect on a bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important that when you begin noticing problems with someone, start making notes!  You’re going to forget the exact details of these situations very quickly and so will everyone else.  The full context of the situation might not make sense without written record of it.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/paggro-notes.jpg" alt="Just don't leave paggro notes" /></p>

<h4 id="just-dont-leave-a-passive-aggresive-notehttpwwwpassiveaggressivenotescom">Just don’t leave a <a href="http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/">passive aggresive note</a>.</h4>

<p>If you feel a negative relationship is going to develop at work, these
notes are going to be invaluable.  Later on, you may find yourself
distraught by things going on and having these notes can really keep
you grounded.  Maybe you’re mistaken and you look back and things
really aren’t so bad.  Or maybe you need a list of a dozen examples of
negative behavior for when you bring it to you manager’s attention.</p>

<p>At one job, the first conversation I had with a person alerted me to
the fact that I would have problems with this person.  I maybe should
have reached out to others at that job about it earlier, because I
think he was manipulating them too.  But I took notes on the things
that happened and I still have them.  Within a week or so, I was able
to determine that, yes, this person was definitely going to give me
problems and that I should interact with him very carefully.  It was
also this guy’s first week: we were hired on the same day.  It was
also a particularly competitive job, since it was like the coolest
company I ever worked for.</p>

<p>Ugh .. doncha hate that?  <strong>Same Team?!</strong></p>

<h3 id="x2605-share-your-tools-for-success">★ Share Your Tools For Success</h3>

<p>In every industry, there are things that can be done better.  Better
ways to do the same work.  After you work a particular role for a
while, you may naturally learn these or you pick them up from the
people around you.  Don’t horde these shortcuts and tools for
yourself.  Give back to the people around you. If you take the time
out of your day to do so, you’ll find that they’ll remember that.</p>

<p>You don’t want to sound condescending when you do it though.  I may be
guilty of this, but it’s not my intention.  I would hope if there’s a
faster way of doing something that someone would show me as well.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-use-the-mirror-effect-to-show-himher-how-their-actions-affect-others">★ Use the Mirror Effect to Show Him/Her How Their Actions Affect Others</h3>

<p>This one is very effective when you’re dealing with a misunderstanding
between coworkers.  However, when you’re dealing with someone who
staunchly wants to push you around and they’re aware of that, the
“mirror effect” doesn’t really work as well.</p>

<p>What is the Mirror Effect?  Oddly enough, it’s from the 48 Laws of
Power.  This one is actually good! It took me forever to get it – and
I mean YEARS. I sorta understood, but not really.  Can I say <em>category
theory</em> one more time?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Mirror Effect is basically mimicking someone’s behavior &amp; words
in way such that you’re basically holding up a mirror to them.  For
people unaware of how their actions are affecting others, it can
serve as a great tool that shows them how they are treating others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/mirror-effect.jpg" alt="Mirror Effect" /></p>

<p>There’s a few problems with the Mirror Effect.  First off, someone
like me is going to have a hard time examining situations from
multiple perspectives, which is required.  If someone doesn’t “get
it,” it’s completely wasted.</p>

<p>Another problem with the Mirror Effect is that using it requires you
to mimick someone’s behavior.  Doing so can actually cause more
problems or misunderstandings.  It has to be used in the right way to
be effective.  Used in the wrong way and you may provide this person
with more fodder to be used against you.</p>

<p>You may want to use the Mirror Effect by interacting with another
coworker in front of the person you have the problem with.  You can
display an equivalent behavior in front of the bully and see how they
react and what they think. However, beware – <strong>no two situations are
ever truely identical.</strong> Most don’t even come close.  And reading
people’s reactions from the Mirror Effect is subject to confirmation
bias.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-ignore-the-haters-dont-play-their-game-shine-on-my-friends">★ Ignore the Haters. Don’t Play Their Game. Shine On, My Friends!</h3>

<p>It’s very important to resist the urge to resort to the same petty
tricks they’re using.  This can create more toxicity in the workplace.
Don’t do it.  Also, you’ll find that this is part of their game: they
draw you out into making mistakes, so they can make a fool of you.
Don’t give them the ammunition they need because you’ll find they’ll
turn it right back against you.</p>

<p>Make sure that you don’t get drawn into their games and forget to do
what the !@#$ you’re paid to do.  This is why this !@#$ pisses me off.
I’m getting paid to !@#$’ing work, not play little highschool games
with grown men.  I’m paid to work and I want to do good things.  If
I’m working for someone, I want to serve them well.  If not, it’ll be
time for me to move on to my next job and I won’t have much experience
to add to my resume.  As someone who doesn’t have a college degree,
experience is vital to me!</p>

<h4 id="if-that-light-were-missing-what-would-you-see">If that light were missing, what would you see?</h4>

<p>Also, be aware, that sometimes business is dirty.  It’s a game where
the people who aren’t “necessary” often find themselves cut out.
Sometimes this is just how the chips fall.  I would say “Don’t hate
the player, hate the game,” but sometimes those players really are
assholes.  So don’t burn your bridges just because you are mistreated,
which is different than being systematically harrassed by someone.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-play-dumb-to-allow-your-opponent-to-make-dumb-mistakes">★ Play Dumb to Allow Your Opponent to Make Dumb Mistakes</h3>

<p>If this person feels they’re safe to get away with something, they’ll
continue stacking their chips in line with their strategy and tactics.
By all means – let them continue with their petty tactics by playing
dumb, where appropriate.  Brush them off lightly for now.  This may
give you even more evidence to use against them later.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So then, why were you going to do <strong>X, Y, <em>and</em> Z?</strong> I’m tired of
shoveling your shit, Rizzo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be careful not to let them get away with too much, though.  If you let
them make too many dirty plays, you may find yourself surrounded.</p>

<p>However, you may not want to call them out on something.  Let them
continue making this mistake.  Let them make one hundred mistakes.
Then, later, you can reveal what truly happened.  And now you have one
hundred reasons.  *This isn’t really a good strategy though – <strong>in
fact it’s terrible</strong> *.  But, you’ll find that people who mistreat a
lot of people in their life have made these immoral mistakes thousands
of times.  You’re not the only one who’s been burned.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-experience-is-your-friend--draw-on-others-experiences-too">★ Experience is Your Friend.  Draw on Others’ Experiences, too.</h3>

<p>When starting a new job, it’s important to get a lay of the land.
Talk with others to learn more about the politics and the recent
history.  Otherwise, you may find yourself making inapproprate
comments for the challanges the team is facing.</p>

<p>But, of course, there are better reasons to get to know the people
around you.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/two-ships.jpg" alt="Two Ships Passing in the Night" /></p>

<h3 id="x2605-grow-your-relationships">★ Grow Your Relationships</h3>

<p>Again, another reason to make lots of friends at a new job.  You’re
going to need those connections and though you shouldn’t be selfishly
motivated to form relationships, you do have several incentives to do
so.</p>

<p>No one wants to work in a sweatshop, where everyone’s got their heads
down eight straight hours a day.  Don’t get me wrong, good employees
like to work hard, but they want to have fun doing it.  This is why
it’s dangerous to become so busy at work that you can’t establish
connections with other people.</p>

<p>Someone who is well connected in a business is going to be harder to
remove: they’re going to have more people standing up for them.
Someone who pays attention to the needs of others and <strong>listens</strong> is
going to be much harder to isolate.  Someone like this may be
important to have around, even if they are not <em>the best</em> at their
job.  People like this grease the wheels.  They make work fun and add
to your culture.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/bonsai-tree.jpg" alt="Bonsai Tree by Takanori Aiba" /></p>

<h4 id="bonsai-tree-by-takanori-aiba">Bonsai Tree by Takanori Aiba</h4>

<p>Also, information is vital.  Knowledge is power.  And staying
connected with those around you gives you more visibility and makes
things more transparent!  IMO, transparency is a virtue in business.
However, I’m not exactly working at Lockheed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again – Managers: <em>*Visibility, Visibility, *VISIBILITY!</em> ** Do not
allow one person to construct your perspective of your office’s
environment and culture!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x2605-dont-burn-your-bridges">★ Don’t Burn Your Bridges</h3>

<p>If you find that this person is manipulating people against you,
remember that these people probably don’t realize the full context of
what they’re doing.  Also, you’re going to need all the connections
you have later on in life.  You really don’t want to burn bridges.
Don’t let a bully burn them either.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-have-fun-make-people-laugh">★ Have Fun, Make People Laugh</h3>

<p>Make sure you’re contributing to a positive work environment.  Maybe
you’re not exactly a stand up comic, but there’s still plenty you can
do to make people laugh.  Find out what TV show’s people watch and
what video games they play.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/devil-is-a-part-timer.jpg" alt="Devil is a Part Timer" /></p>

<h4 id="the-devil-is-a-part-timerhttpwwwhulucomthe-devil-is-a-part-timer"><a href="http://www.hulu.com/the-devil-is-a-part-timer">The Devil is a Part Timer</a></h4>

<p>Video games are great because it gives people in the office who might
not otherwise connect a chance to compete with their team mates in
activities outside of work.  Games &amp; sports also offer a great way to
see how people approach challenges and offers a great way to see how
your team interacts.  You can structure your activities around getting
people to collaborate in new ways or pairing new people up.  It will
drive dialogue and make your team healthier.</p>

<p>Also, a person causing toxicity to show up in the workplace may also
drive negative interactions in other places.  So if you can spot team
problems in other activities, you might diagnose them earlier.</p>

<p>If you find that someone is being cut off from activities outside of
work, this could be considered fraternization, especially if it
involves a manager and consistent, small set of subordinates.  While
usually activities that involve fraternization appear harmless –
<strong>and may be harmless</strong> – they can be especially detrimental if
someone is using them in the right way!  If it is in fact
fraternization, this is very wrong!</p>

<p>If it happens to be that someone is cut off from stuff going on
outside of the office, this still kinda sucks. Be the person that
reaches out.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-talk-to-the-bully">★ Talk to the Bully</h3>

<p>A lot of these situations are basically misunderstandings, which can
be defused fairly simply through communication.  Don’t allow a
negative situation to grow worse.  Find out what’s causing these
situations to grow, so you can diffuse them quickly.  Otherwise,
tensions mount and you got a shitstorm brewin’.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You got a shitstorm brewin’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one should be unhappy at work.  Work should be something you love.
You should invest your life doing things you love that give back to
other people, whether it’s people served through the business or
simply your family.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-ignore-the-bully">★ Ignore the Bully</h3>

<p>Workplace bullies can be exceedingly manipulative, abrasive and toxic.
Sometimes it really doesn’t matter what you do, they have made up in
their minds that they are going to take anything you give them and
turn it to poop.  At this point, you may need to separate yourself
from them.  But be careful: isolation is dangerous and may be exactly
what this person wants!</p>

<p>You may want to avoid 1 On 1 Communication with this Person
… sometimes.  Like I said above, you’re going to want to reach out
to this person first – start by saying things 1 on 1, but don’t make
accusations.  Allow them to become aware of what is going on, so that
they can react to it appropriately without feeling like they are being
chastised, especially in public, in front of others.</p>

<p>There’s a certain kind of 1 on 1 interaction you want to avoid with
this person.  You don’t want to feel like this person threatens you in
private or uses private communications to manipulate and steal credit
for your work.  So definitely avoid that, if it’s happening.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-defy-labels-and-define-yourself">★ Defy Labels and Define Yourself</h3>

<p>This is something I do in my personal life.  I don’t like to be
labelled as “liberal” or “conservative” because once you are, you
acquire all the rest of the baggage that comes along with those
labels.  So be wary when someone makes statements in front of others,
the implications of which may cause the people around you to attach a
label!  Be neutral.</p>

<h4 id="define-yourself---kounterfit-klothinghttpkntrftcomsrcdc">“Define Yourself” - <a href="http://kntrft.com/?src=dc">Kounterfit Klothing</a></h4>

<p>I don’t mean to down on jamskaters in this series.  There are some
really great, inspiration skaters out there.  There’s a few of them
pictured above.  They’re incredibly innovative people on the cusp of a
sport totally new – something most people don’t get.  Most people
will never truly experience the edge of innovation on something new
and completely wide open, but that’s Jamskating.</p>

<p>Most of the negativity I experienced in jamskating took place in 2005
and ended in 2009.  The jamskating culture has been constantly
improving in the past few years.  So, I’m sorry to have brought it up
again.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-beware-of-retribution">★ Beware of Retribution</h3>

<p>Using some of these tools and diffusing some of the bullies
manipulations <strong>will piss that person off</strong>, especially if everyone
suddenly <em>gets it</em>.  If a bully is outed in their manipulations, you
can bet on it.  Sometimes this is necessary – but it’s better to not
bring attention to someone’s mistakes publicly!  So beware of
attracting attention, but don’t allow your fear to enable this person
to get away with toying with people.</p>

<h3 id="x2605-stand-up-for-others">★ Stand Up for Others</h3>

<p>If you’ve been in this position before, then you’ll recognize how bad
it makes you feel.  So stand up for others if you feel that they’re
being unfairly treated.  Learn to see situations from multiple
perspectives and recognize when someone is being unfairly treated.
And do something about it when it happens.  People are more likely to
stand up for you if you do and you’ll set a good example for others.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-02-26-workplace-bullying-part-four/v-for-vendetta.jpg" alt="V for Vendetta" /></p>

<h2 id="identifying-someone-bullying-others-at-work">Identifying Someone Bullying Others At Work</h2>

<p>Also, many of these tactics aren’t inherently bad in and of
themselves.  It really depends on the intention and the scenario in
which they are used.  It’s crucial to recognize the motivations behind
the behavior.  Is this person underperforming and seeking to distract
from that by puttting a spotlight on someone else?</p>

<p>If it’s moreso a personality issue and they’re not strategically
messing with other people, that’s easier to deal with.  Still a big
deal if they’re negative and bringing other people down, but I think
it’s easier to deal with than someone who is strategically employing
passive agressive behavior.  At least you know it’s not someone doing
this to seek promotion or for job security.</p>
