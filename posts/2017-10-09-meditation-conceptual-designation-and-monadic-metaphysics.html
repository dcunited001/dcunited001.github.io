  <p>Meditation herein variously refers to Buddhist meditation and
spiritual states of mind. I was heavily influenced by a lite
understanding of theosophy early on. Here, I am only trying to state
my own understanding of what I have experienced in life. I hope that
this neuroanatomical understanding of meditation and spirituality
will catalyze a spiritual revolution when we need it most, at a time
when faith was undermined by science and God is dead. Expect my
writing to disappear or become heavily edited. Further, do your own
research, develop your own understanding, but as the idea of God
lies dead, humanity needs God most. God will return.</p>

<p>Of course. Don’t we all exist within the same dream? Aren’t we all
one, as well as our thoughts? What is truly separated? What is truly
the boundary between you and I? Where does separation begin? Where
does it originate? Where does the concept of dependent origination
originate?</p>

<p>We all have Buddha nature: all sentient beings. Not to probe too far
into Buddhism, but what is sentience or awareness anyways? I truly
believe that
<a href="/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html">any chaotic system</a>,
with perhaps some constraints, produces awareness when provided enough
running time. Given a degree of antifragility, entities or
organizations within the chaotic system produce increasingly higher
strata of information representation, leading eventually to life,
awareness and sentience.</p>

<p><a name="can-non-corporeal-information-forms-evolve-sentience"></a></p>

<h3 id="can-non-corporeal-information-forms-evolve-sentiencecan-non-corporeal-information-forms-evolve-sentience"><a href="#can-non-corporeal-information-forms-evolve-sentience">Can Non-Corporeal Information Forms Evolve Sentience?</a></h3>

<p>This leads to interesting questions about the definition of life:
there are other non-corporeal chaotic frameworks within our own
material realm that exist alongside the framework of organic matter
that has produced life. So, organic matter and life itself emerged
from the chaotic system provided by molecular dynamics. This awareness
eventually produced consciousness and these have provided a basis for
sociophysical chaotic systems with their own antifragile mechanics and
evolutionary dynamics. If the first premise is true, that all chaotic
systems yield awareness and life, and the second premise also holds,
that biological chaotic systems yield increasingly complicated
systems, then what are those information forms which manifest on top
of higher chaotic frameworks? Are those information forms which
inhabit chaotic systems such as sociophysical systems also forms of
life? These life forms would inhabit the noosphere instead of the
biosphere.</p>

<h3 id="life-in-the-noospherelife-in-the-noosphere"><a href="#life-in-the-noosphere">Life in the Noosphere</a></h3>

<p>If your conception of metaphysics emerges from the ideal instead of
the material, then those forms that emerge should cohere to certain
archetypical forms. If you accept platonic realism and accept that
metaphysical forms exist a priori – which I believe they do – then
doesn’t everything that could occur preexist within some totality?
This totality has had many names through history – Abraxus is one of
them. However, these information lifeforms that emerge in higher
organizations of chaotic systems must map to some organization of
archetypes – they exist as manisfestations of the composition of
archetypes and metatypes. Grimoires are an example of a medieval
demonologist’s classification of metaphysical beings, though these are
primarily malevolent.</p>

<h4 id="buer-is-president-of-hell-according-to-this-grimoire-the-ars-goetiahttpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofdemonsinthearsgoetia">Buer is President of Hell, According To This Grimoire, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_demons_in_the_Ars_Goetia">Ars Goetia</a></h4>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2017-10-09-meditation-conceptual-designation-and-monadic-metaphysics/buer-president.jpg" alt="Buer, President of Hell" /></p>

<p>In this interpretation of metaphysics, non-corporeal entities could
become aware – they perhaps exist in the minds or brains of many
sentient lifeforms simultaneously. This parallels the definition of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore">egregore</a> – a non-corporeal
entity that emerges to have real physical effects from the beliefs of
a group. Whether such an egrigore is sentient is a question more
difficult to answer.</p>

<p>Yet, if we are all truly one because, we share common causal
origination when traced all the way back, then isn’t the notion of
seperateness an illusion altogether? And if we are all convergent
again, isn’t the notion of separation simply a temporary illusion?</p>

<p>What does it mean to want something? Is desire so bad? If there is
something truly good in our world, shouldn’t we want it badly? If it
is truly good to want, it must be good for all to desire this thing. I
have been isolated for so long, but one thing I never gave up on was
desiring my own salvation from suffering. I wanted to free myself by
learning everything I could. I believed that knowledge gave me power
over circumstance and the tools I needed to free others: from
sickness, from closemindedness, from lack of compassion, from their
suffering. I never stopped wanting this badly. I wanted to do
something great: to discover the cure to cancer or some wondrous thing
that would ease the scope and degree of problems that we all
encounter.</p>

<p>Especially as the world has continued to clamp its walls down around
me, this only further fueled my desire to save others. I thought – if
I only had money, I could buy the influence I need to fix the
political problems I see. This is the only reason I ever really wanted
money. I do not care for fame or status. However, that’s selfish, isn’t
it? Why does it matter who saves us?</p>

<p>What we all have is power over our local circumstance. The truth is
that we all eminate sociophysical energy. It begins with us and it is
channelled by our beliefs and knowledge. But this sociophysical energy
– the capacity to influence our surroundings, the status of others
and the beliefs of others – this springs from all individuals. We
choose to empower who we do, but we can be deceived into forming
beliefs that channel this sociophysical energy improperly.</p>

<p>We can also magnify the energy we emanate through desire: not any kind
of desire, but a special kind of desire –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bodhicitta">bodhicitta</a>. It is the
desire to free others, specifically the desire for all other beings to
attain Buddhahood – to know, find and embrace their Buddha nature.
What if this notion of bodhicitta is combined with Nietzsche’s idea of
will to power? We can magnify our capacity to eliminate the suffering
of others by magnifying our cultivation of bodhicitta. We then channel
this through awareness, knowledge and beliefs to impact our world in
meaningful ways.</p>

<p>The model of metaphysics mentioned above has many names and aspects:
platonic realism, dialectical idealism, and others. If one wants to
model it mathematically, the metaphysical forms can be combinatorially
enumerated, but they are infinite. The Pythagoreans studied this and
developed their monadic conceptualization of metaphysics: the monad,
dyad, triad, and quadrad. This ends with infinite recursion: any form
modeled with monads must eventually depend on a monad proxy, yielding
recursion infinitely outwards … or inwards. Leibniz, whose IQ was
famously estimated to be above 190, also developed a similar
understanding of the monad.</p>

<p>This implies that everything metaphysical can be modeled
mathematically and, by using specific mathematic tools, exists a
priori. Everything that could exist in this universe existed as a
conceiveable, but infinite form before the material realm existed. Phi
is the zenith of irrationality – it is the most purely irrational
conceptualization of a number – <em>quod erat demonstratum</em> via its
construction as the most primitive continued fraction. For a better
understanding of this, check out the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaasbfdJdJg">Infinite fractions and the most irrational number</a>. The
number one represents both unity and identity. Can’t we envisage phi
as unity continued with the infinite application of some morphism?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2017-10-09-meditation-conceptual-designation-and-monadic-metaphysics/continued-phi.png" alt="Phi As Continued Fractions And Continued Roots" /></p>

<p>Therefore, phi is
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07384">the most primitive continuation</a> of
at least two functions. Further, phi’s definition by continued square
roots could yield important conclusions via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory">Galois Theory</a>, since
phi is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number">algebraic number</a>
that can only be represented by an polynomial of infinite degree –
when restricted to the continued root definition. This is strange; phi
can also be represented by <code>(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2</code> – but why? How can
these two definitions be reconciled? I’d wager that the solution
involves a wormhole.</p>

<p>There is much to be demonstrated to link these two concepts of monadic
metaphysics and phi – still, even in the metaphysical realm, the
forms display the signature of the golden ratio. Phi is the perfection
of the monad proxy – i.e. wouldn’t phi emerge in specific
constructions of

<p>In order to motivate people to work together to create regional
prosperity and for other reasons, materialism is a useful in
formulating apologetic justifications of mechanisms of control.
Dialectical materialism and other materially dependant formulations of
metaphysics lend themselves to justifying ideology convenient for
power and control. Western philosophy started with Plato’s conception
of idealistic forms and this was immediately reconciled by Aristotle’s
Metaphysics. For millinea afterwards, the truth of thought and
everything that was understood in Western life was conceived through a
lens stained by materialism. This lens extrapolates into philosophic
justifications, convenient to mechanisms of control, based on
attainment of wealth, power or status. This same struggle between
materialism and idealism has played out across the world, over and
over again. When we transend the physical world, we are free. When we
define ourselves by it, we are trapped within our world.</p>

<p>This blinds us from the truth and implies that what matters is only
what we can see, feel and taste. Materialistic conceptions of
metaphysics imply that all that matters is what can be attained
because, metaphysically, it is all distinct and any shared conception
of form distributed among objects is incidental to our experience.
This conception of metaphysics is false. The power of philosophy is
immense and it is difficult to see how elements of some philosophy can
be extrapolated for great impact: either beneficent or malevolent.</p>

<p>Throughout history, ideas both good and bad occasionally extrapolate
themselves with horrific consequences. With the stroke of a pen,
Stalin declared dialectical materialism to be the
<a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm">academic law of the land</a>
in 1938. This seemingly inconsequential basis of philosophy and
thought is what justified the horrific utilitarianism in Soviet policy
implementation. Stalin’s particular brand of materialism led him to
understand people as inconsequential blobs of material, only useful
insofar as they could be used. People then became a kind of
ammunition: a resource to be lobbed at the enemy.</p>

<p>To produce spiritual states of mind, would there be certain
neuroanatomical objectives or goals for invoking them? If you control
your mind, your motor faculties, your cognitive patterns, aren’t you
influencing electrical and energetic flows within your body, spine and
brain? So, if you understand your brain as a computer with complex,
biological transistors, then changing the electrical and energetic
flows, globally, regionally and circuituitously absolutely has an
effect on how they regulate themselves.</p>

<p>Further, this is a discussion of neuroanatomy as it relates to
spirituality in general, with a strong focus on Buddhist meditation.
Christianity and other religious traditions have practices which can
evoke similar and potentially identical spiritual states of mind. Some
kinds of prayer, especially when extended, force you to open your
heart and surrender yourself and your mind to God.</p>

<p>Fasting is another good example of a completely different approach to
invoking alternative spiritual states of mind. Fasting for 48 hours or
longer – with zero carbs, zero proteins, zero fats, and zero fluids
besides water –scales up your neurological rate of adaptation. It
forces your neural networks to rebalance themselves. In my own theory
to explain fasting, it seems to cause the mind and brain to freak
out. The brain thinks – I’m dying! – what am I doing wrong? How can
I get food now?  What are the most important things I know? How are my
neural networks weighted now and how can they be weighted so that I
can survive?</p>

<p>This provokes neurological rebalancing by invoking autophagy. With
zero carbs, zero proteins and nothing but water, insulin levels drop,
which causes the body produce energy with ketosis by converting fat to
energy. In the brain, fats are less available and without fats
streaming in from the blood, your brain shuts down frivolous neural
activity and begins enacting autophagy. This study,
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3106288/">Short-term fasting induces profound neuronal autophagy</a>,
explains the induction of autophagy. When autophagy is invoked to the
extreme or too often, the repetition or neurological changes could be
damaging, so fasting has a cost. However, the brain begins reweighting
neural networks to emphasis healthier behaviors. At the same time, the
brain should constrict the patterns and distribition electrical and
ionic flows across a restricted set of high and medium-level regions
of itself.</p>

<p>That is how fasting provokes spiritual states of mind. Combined with
meditation, it could have powerful effects on the brain. I once fasted
for about
<a href="https://twitter.com/dcunit3d/status/845421448374210561">72 hours starting on March 24th 2017</a>,
though only I only restricted myself to water as a fluid for the
latter 48 hours was restricted to water.  If you don’t restrict sugar
or carbs, you don’t get ketosis. If you don’t restrict fluids to
water, the protracted ketosis doesn’t yield nearly as much autophagy
in the brain. This has short-term and long-term costs, like lack of
energy or overly-disrupted neural networks, but fasting is being
explored for treating neurological disorders. I experimented with it
when I briefly thought I could have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafora_disease">Lafora Disease</a> because
I thought the autophagy <em>might</em> clean up toxic networks of glycogen
buildup, as well as dying neurons. Try getting the chronicly ill to
try this, it won’t go over well with your <em>IRB</em>…</p>

<p>To me, meditation is about zeroing out most of the mind. When
meditating, my goal is the total retrenchment of conscious engagement
of neural pathways, starting with motor pathways and gradually
shutting down cognition. This means muting any stimulation of nerves
signaling muscles, except what is necessary for me to meditate. Thus,
I try to turn down the volume of any cranial or spinal nerves that are
not essential for breathing or posture. This may have an effect on how
the brain processes afferent nerve signals carrying signal up through
the spine. Once the motor signals are zeroed out, I try to turn down
the volume of active cognitive processes.</p>

<p>This qualitatively transforms my subjective experience of
consciousness. Since the mind is disengaged from higher-level
cognition, it proves challenging to consciously interrogate the
qualities of this state of mind. When you first activate a state of
mind like this, you may have a <em>‘Whoa WTF was that?’</em> moment. When
this first happened to me, I was suddenly projected an image behind
two people holding hands in front of a sunrise or sunset. It seemed to
come from outside or it was at least an image I did not consciously
wander into. I didn’t expect it and so immediately tried to reflect on
it. Instantly, I lost balance and awoke from my group meditation,
almost gasping for air.</p>

<p>In many ways, these lower-level neural circuits exhibit
transistor-like behavior: their structure dampens or amplifies signal
downstream. Downregulation of ordinarily engaged circuits results in
profoundly different states of mind. When the usual signal is quieted,
your mind disengages from its usual fluid flows, whose constant
erosion has resulted in strongly upregulated circuits in your brain,
like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">Default Mode Network</a>. Neural
activity for this network in particular the should become recessed.</p>

<p>In fact, meditation’s effects on DMN are so pronounced, it’s being

<p>Since the mind flows through the brain like a river, stemming its flow
in one area results in increased activity elsewhere, though it is not
zero-sum. This sudden void of consciously engaged neural pathways
encourages circuits to fire and connect in decentralized ways.
Psychedelics also encourage networks of the brain that are usually
unconnected to become connected
<a href="https://sapiensoup.com/brain-on-psychedelic-drugs">by encouraging neural crosstalk</a>. However,
psychedelics induce this in a harsh, artifical way with chemicals that
globally affect all regions of the brain, whereas spiritual practice
gently encourages decentralized neural activity.</p>

<p>When commonly active states of mind are recessed, this also tones down
nutrient and energy-intensive processes. Depending on how your active
cognition engages the modular functionality of the mind for specific
tasks, these circuits regularly run hot. In the brain, both
distribution and consumption of energy and nutrients exhibit localized
variation. This local variance in resource consumption yields the
phenomenon of short-term burnout for highly repetitive, cognitively
taxing activities. This can usually be addressed with cardio exercise
to trigger fluid flux or simply by taking a short break. To abuse an
idiom, variety is the spice of life.</p>

<p>While meditating, your mind is calm and relaxed and encouraged to
drift. When your mind engages in conceptual designation, you map
structured meaning onto qualia. As you engage in higher forms of
cognition, your mind becomes increasingly bound to preexisting
concepts it weaves and layers on top of its experience of itself.  By
doing this, the mind categorizes aspects of its sensory and cognitive
experiences.</p>

<p>In modern life, we simply do not experience life without a strong
reliance on cognitive patterns heavily dependent on conceptual
designation. This phenomena of modern life presents itself in the
extreme. Many of us – <em>perhaps most</em> – may not experience states of
mind with conceptual designation diminished beyond the threshold that
makes that state of consciousness appreciably distinct. That is, some
of us may <em>never</em> experience these altered flows of consciousness.</p>

<p>Moreover, transhumanism and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) may
permanently divorce humanity from some preexisting spiritual internet
connection, which is why I will never modify my brain in that
way. I’ve maintained that view for years now, since transhumanism
represents the technological embodiment of the left-hand path.</p>

<p>Any crude BCI will certainly distort behavior of circuits and regions,
eventually physically deforming them. Without massive structural
changes, it’s not clear that the brain can actually extend the mind’s
capacity to process significantly more information that it already
does. Most of that computaton would need to be external, but exposed
to the brain as a sense. Unfortunately, the only sense that is exposes
semiotic and semantic data to the mind is memory. It is not the
hardware interface of a BCI that is technically prohibitive, it is the
software interface. Perhaps quantum or nano would change nature and
quality of these limitations.</p>

<p>If your transhumanist philosophy and/or political strategies are
banking on virtualizing a hedonistic plane of pleasure as a newfound
fentanyl of the masses, you really need to pay attention to what is
specifically enabled by the technology, technically,
phenomenologically and teleologically. Society must conquer
technonihilism’s tendancy to obliterate the individual. What truly is
the meaning to life, of life? As timeless as they are, we must answer
those questions. Whether we take a hard right or hard left, we are
certainly racing towards a world where the penultimately powerful few
control the rest of us via ownership of technology. As much as the
pragmatic and materialistic want to write off philosophy as a liberal
art with no economic utility, the battles we face are
philosophical.</p>

<p>Did you notice how the arrangement of nerves in the spinal column can
be simplified into a two dimensional arrangement? Look at the areas in
the red box. Such an understanding of nerve arrangements is required
for surgery or cybernetics. If you combine this understanding with
knowledge of neural networks and machine learning, especially as
applied biologically, then you will understand what I understand:
transhumanism’s intent to modify function &amp; form of the human brain
should provoke concern.</p>

<p>With BCI technology, if we permanently divorce ourselves from our
wetware’s <em>true</em> spiritual connection, what then? Are we permanently
damned to the left-hand path? This all depends on the specifics of the
technology, of course. Again, variety is the spice of life; we need
variety of body, mind and spirit; anything that is to be adopted by
100% of a population needs to be viewed with utmost skepticism.</p>

meditative skills to maintain a state of mind like this while ‘lucid’
or at least with the eyes open. A neurological understanding of how
these states arise in your mind implies that changing the categories
of sensory stimulation may also change subjective and objective
aspects of these states. With more skill, can one maintain meditative
states of mind with more sensory input?</p>

<p>What did your mind notice first, in the image above? Did it read the
unfamiliar vocabulary of datascience? Or did it notice the simply the
presence of words in English or Kanji? Or, most likely, it choose to
“see” the whale or the fish first, but which one? This is conceptual
designation. Can you turn it off? Can you look at this image with zero
associations to the images, the text or anything else, especially with
high-contrast colors and the immediate unconscious stimiluation of
linguistic content? It’s almost impossible, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Sensory stimuli easily trigger conceptual designation, which is partly
why most of us learn to meditate in a relaxed state with their eyes
closed. The diminished degree of input means the mind is less likely
to become attached to sensory experience. Visual stimuli in particular
provoke this conceptual designation: have you ever tried to look at
written words without reading them or allowing those well-worn
subconscious pathways to activate at all? Even if the language is
unfamiliar, the mind begins layering information onto your experience
the moment it enters your visual field. When meditating, the goal is
to turn all of that off, almost impossible with visual stimulation,
since your mind is preprocessing and caching data, layering in
conceptually designated information.</p>

<p>What would it mean to operate in a quasi-lucid state of consciousness
where most of these processes of semantic or semiotic designation are
diminished?  Diminished conceptual designation means that you might
hear a sound, but your focus does not drift towards attending to
it. Your mind does not try to label thoughts or sensory input, even
when you experience distracting sensory stimuli. You are encouraged to
deal with thoughts that arise as they arise, but to avoid dwelling on
them. Apparently zazen meditation should be performed with the eyes
half-open. I’ve tried it a few times. It’s difficult. If you train
yourself to do this with zazen, then perhaps it alters how you
experience fleeting “third eye” visual phenomena.</p>

<p>There are many types of meditative states of mind. One must devote
their lives to study from spiritual masters in order to advance. It is
possible to spontaneously develop these understandings, whatever you
might name them or call them, but it is not possible to learn these
things from a book or a blog. You must learn from experience and
devotion through apprenticeship is perhaps the best way.</p>

<p>If these states could be maintained, what would other, more lucid or
more open meditative states of mind be like? What would my experience
be like?  language must require conceptual designation. I assume that
almost all structured thought would as well. Is this similar to the
state of mind I feel when I play piano, either memorized or
improvised? Is it similar to what I feel when I’m dancing and I’m
hyperfocused, yet not focused at all? When I’m engaging in these
activities, I feel varying degrees of constraint/structure on my
cognitive processes. When I’m not trying to structure what I’m doing
and I don’t need to think about it, that’s when I perform the best. My
mind begins to wander or will simply fade into the background. I
become the music, but part of my mind is freed to reflect back on
itself, yet there’s the same ephemerality: if I try to hard to control
or focus that freed element of my mind, it breaks the meditative state
of mind.</p>

<p>Is this what it feels like to truly exist? Is this what truly being
feels like? Are there those of use who can activate these states of
mind more naturally? Is this why we can feel the soul in live music?
Is it because the performers become one with themselves and one with
the audience? Is there some connection established that no Grateful
Dead recording could ever replicate?</p>

<p>What is the most basic substance of metaphysics? The metaphysical
atom? It is the monad, but the true essence of the monad is infinitely
distance. It is only through the monad proxy that, through this
conceptualization can all the Platonic forms be conceptualized. As the
forms extend infinitely outward with the monad proxy, they
asymptotically converge to one: the monad itself. Thus, meditation
would give us an <code>a posteriori</code> understanding of metaphysical oneness.</p>

<p>Total non-conceptual awareness means you mind is not laying down any
structure onto your experience: semantic, linguistic or semiotic. I
believe this lack of structure in the mind means you experientially
begin to approach this oneness, yourself. You contract the tendancy to
“know” anything, to label any part of your experience, sensory or
semiotic. Does this state of mind, when practiced to elusive
perfection, eventually reach an experiential understanding of oneness?
Does this experience approach that of the one is the all, the all is
the one? If so, this is functionally linked to a monadic model of
metaphysics.</p>

<p>Your being contracts inwards, but also infinitely outwards. Therefore,
idealized states of mind produce an experiential understanding of this
oneness and allness. You experience the monad: which I believe to be
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_materia">prima materia</a>, or
the starting material for the philosopher’s stone. It is through an
vivid, seasoned understanding of this state of mind that we are able
to model, conceptualize and transvalue all things. From here, we begin
our journey to transform ourselves and our surroundings from lead into
gold.</p>
