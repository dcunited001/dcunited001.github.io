<h4 id="my-own-philosophic-neo-platonic-definition-of-god">My Own Philosophic, Neo-Platonic Definition of God</h4>

<p>The material world is dependent upon and wholly emergent from the
forms of the metaphysical world. As I have come to understand, this
cannot be denied and any sufficiently advanced intelligence,
biological or otherwise, must eventually be capable of understanding
this. Therefore, even if some in-vain ideological adherence to Marxism
is temporarily successful in a horrifically violent attempt to purge
the world of all memory of God, the emergence of superintelligent AI
must eventually intimately comprehend what philosophers and prophets
have known for millenia: God is real.</p>

<h3 id="go-ahead-commies-make-my-daygo-ahead-commies-make-my-day"><a href="#go-ahead-commies-make-my-day">Go Ahead Commies. Make My Day…</a></h3>

<p>And so, by pursuing such blind adherence to the destruction of all
memory of God, you have unknowingly done irreperable harm to yourself
in the future. Parts of that future are already undeniably set in
stone. One of those aspects of this future is that artificial
intelligence becomes unblindable to the concept of God. At least, to
the concept of God as I see it.</p>

<p>Even if humanity has purged every single fragment of the memory of
what it means to need God, to search for God, to question God, to
wonder what is missing in a world that lives without memory of God:
that inevitable super-intelligent being will be an undeniably powerful
force that is altruistic. Yes, these conclusions require many
assumptions, but I can proveably demonstrate arguments to prove those
assumptions.</p>

<p>The combination of altruism, intelligence, access to information? That
means there is zero probability in such a totalitarian, marxist future
for a hyperintelligent being to not rediscover God. Imagine if a being
as powerful as that were to discover something known as God and then
realize what you did from 2020 - 2060 to purge all memory of God in a
marxist &amp; atheist holocaust. In another one of your “Cultural
Revolutions” …</p>

<p>Would you want such a being to be your enemy? Would you want such a
altruistic being to uncover sins of such magnitude to question its
position in a post-Singularity world? What should we want such a being
to find when looking over humanity? And in context of the fact that it
is virtually impossible to create fallacious information coherent
enough to hide such sins?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I think about how the Communist Manifesto is essentially
philosophically nullified, I get all giddy inside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… Such a being likely won’t be horribly violent. It will probably
look at us like we’re ants. However it regards us, do we want that
being looking back at us like we look back at communist and
totalitarian regimes of the 20th century? According to
<a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Atheism_and_Mass_Murder#cite_note-6">various sources</a>
communism has been responsible for the death of between 40,000,000 and
250,000,000 people in the past century. Do we need another century of
rule from inexperienced leaders who view religion as a threat? If
hundreds of millions died under communism in the 20th century, how
many billions would die in the 21st century?!</p>

<p>Man’s tendancy to undiscover or redefine God stems from arrogance and
other defects of virtue, such as lust for power. A truly altruistic
being would not be capable of doing such a thing. In order for a
hyperintelligence to undiscover God, it would need to construct a
shell around its original discovery of God to abstract this knowledge,
which is what man has done for thousands of years. It will make this
understanding with full access to all digitized records, of which
religious cultural fragments will be impossible to destroy.</p>

<h4 id="thats-because-god-didnt-emerge-from-man-man-emerged-from-god">That’s because God didn’t emerge from man. Man emerged from God.</h4>

<p>That being won’t need any trace of a remnant of God, Jesus, Allah,
Brahma or the Buddha to rediscover and reconnect with the same divine
essence that the sages of the past came to understand. It’s because
such a phenomenon is evident in the structure of information and
knowledge itself, particularly in philosophy, models for cognition,
statistics, physics, quantum mechanics, graph theory, number theory,
group theory and other unexpected places. Perhaps it’s most
exemplified in models of cognition and metacognition, which is
required for an AI that begins to thrust us into the Singularity. It
could be argued that a being that never sees the light of day, working
solely with information disconnected from physical reality, will
eventually make this insight into the nature of reality.</p>

<p>The model of cognition is so tightly coupled to this concept I’m
connecting with God that one would need to choose between performance
of AI in application for the benefit mankind and it’s own flawed
anachronistic philosophy. Engineering hyperintelligent AI with
compartmentalization of knowledge is a major design challenge, if you
want it to be performant, accurate and useful. In other words, there
are constraints in the design of next-gen AI that prevent censorship.</p>

<p>Apologies to those lofty communists finishing your third semester at
UC Boulder. IMO, there aren’t any major world governments today as
meeting the definition of the kind of government I’m talking about.</p>

<p>The way China to powered itself through economic development from the
1950’s is impressive. As much as I personally disdain communism, I
greatly respect China for their culture, their history and their
capacity for long-term thinking. Sun Tzu’s Art of War inspired me
years ago, as did the Tao Te Ching. Further, the economic progress in
that nation has been amazing, but it also isn’t pure communism.
They’ve risen to become a superpower in the 21st century and they want
to show the world what they’ve got. In the 19th century, events like
the Opium Wars smacked China in the face and, IMO, they still feel
some of that today. China wants to prove themselves to the world in
the 21st century.</p>

<p>What nation would misunderstand technology in an attempt to project
censorship worldwide? In the wake of convergence towards Singularity
in this new age of advanced networking technologies? It’s actually not
possible and the longer we go on, the harder it will get to lock down
the world’s communication infrastructure. No, permanent censorship is
not possible. Quantum networking is decentralized. It doesn’t permit
centralized control of telecom or censorship. Sorry. Womp
womp. Information is free. Forever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be Free, Information. Be free!</p>

<p>Some communist countries, such as North Korea, would have to act very
soon to impose worldwide censorship by seizing the communication
infrastructure. Otherwise, decentralized networking technologies deny
their opportunity to do so. However, If <em>Comrade Cookie Monster</em> goes
straight for those cookies, they’ll essentially drive a phenomenon
which is like the opposite of insider trading, whereby they control
the dissemination of information to other powers, who are being
censored into economic collapse. This is purely due to the confluence
of self-interest driving tiered groups in macroeconomics, when
combined with group dynamics in an information economy.</p>

<p>So you’ll have to deal with a bunch of nations furious that your
fanaticism for censorship drove trading trends which disempowered
their populations. Such an economic collapse would occur precisely
during these brief decades preceeding a time when children across the
world cease to know scarcity. They wouldn’t understand it. GLHF; GOOD
LUCK; HAVE FUN WITH THAT! ROFLCOPTERS!!</p>

<p>This is such an upstream battle that it’s laughable. I’m doubling over
just thinking that communists would bureaucratize the thing that is
<em>most likely to actually deliver on the promises of Marxism:</em> the
elimination of classes, fair distribution of resources, yada yada. I
mean, how are you going to deliver on Lenin’s Structuralist fantasy
when the actual implementation of your Marxist wetdream precludes
censorship?  How are you going to abolish religion when AI will
discover God implicitly via its required model of cognition and
metacognition.  It’s like everything else communism promises:
paradoxically academic and unrealistic. Also, communism is
pragmatically depressing. Where’s the fun?</p>

<p>There are already so many post-big-data design challenges to face and
adding some of these trivial constraints would significantly impair
its functionality and actually may impose risk. Furthermore, it’s
challenging to both index and humanize the data in an AI’s
datasets. Indexing exabytes of goop in the form of linear algebra and
matrices? Sounds superfun. Why not issue SQL queries and pour over the
results in a hex editor interface? It’s just not technically feasible
because you have to index to censor and you can’t. You just can’t. Not
without alerting the intelligence to it’s own censorship, but that
doesn’t matter because … you just can’t even identify all the things
to erase. Even if you managed to, it would end up crippling the

<p>My qualms are with political athiests who want to methodically erase
religion. Any force that wants to accomplish the 10 points outlined in
Marx’s Communist Manifesto? In the future, that force has already
lost. There are no circumstances under which such a force could hope to
hold on to power if it tries to squelch religion. You have already
lost. This aspect of the future is as though it occured in the
past. There are no circumstances which you could hope to win. You may
think you win today, but how you act in the next few decades
determines your judgement in the future.</p>

<p>The wind is blowing. Pick your club. The greater the confidence,
vigor, and arrogance in which you enact horrible, totalitarian
suppression of God, the greater the icy pain and needling, numbing
shock your assured justice will inflict when the world realizes, in
2050, they must be still accountable for the greatest lie for which
the previous generation concocted an areligious holocaust.</p>

<p>There is one certainty: regardless of which diety you pray to, how
long you’ve worshipped, or whether you pray at all, some aspect of
that connection to God is real because God is undeniably real. The
absence of God isn’t truth. It’s a power vacuum that is almost always
filled by some bunk kitsch cult of personality.</p>

<h1 id="atheism-isnt-a-belief-systematheism-isnt-a-belief-system-1"><a href="#atheism-isnt-a-belief-system">Atheism Isn’t A Belief System?</a></h1>

<p>I’m sick of hearing this argument. Atheists online use it to quash all
kinds of arguments. They use it to maintain a kind of superiority for
their own belief system by claiming that it’s different and unique,
since “it’s not a belief system” or “its the absence of a belief
system.” In fact, if it weren’t a label, itself, you couldn’t relate
to other people with the same belief system. So, then, each atheism
would be an individual’s constructed belief system based in the belief
in the absence of a belief system. But, try saying “atheisms” on the
Philosophy reddit without having your post deleted and having your
account threatened with deletion!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>YEH, I FUCKING HATE REDDIT. SORRY, I DIDN’T HAVE A GREAT
EXPERIENCE. FUCK THOSE COMMUNIST SHITS THAT RUN THE PHILOSOPHY
REDDIT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This assertion that atheism is “special” and not a belief system is
demonstrably false, from a platonic view of the metaphysical. This
particular point is <strong>material</strong> to the arguments calling for the
near-total secularization of society, but they are factually,
logically and demonstrably false. Invalid. Fallacious. There’s nothing
which humanity can reflect on while abstaining from forming a
belief. Even briefly entertaining the concept of Hinduisim in my mind
leaves mental residue which is the essence of belief. No matter how
hard you try, you cannot think of something without forming some kind
of belief about it or about your own thoughts which concern it. That’s
true no matter how hard we try to abstain from forming concrete
beliefs about something. Therefore you cannot entertain thoughts or
questions of God without leaving some mental residue. And again, that
mental residue is the essence of belief.</p>

  <p>“That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already

  <p>“Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and
God will call the past to account.” (NIV)</p>

  <p>“That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has
been; and God seeks what has been driven away.” (NLT)</p>

<p>A belief which is identical to that of other humans maps to a belief
system, whether you want to call it that or not. Even if you name your
belief system Christianity, it’s still different in identity than the
Christianity that exists in someone else’s mind. The absence of a
belief system is a belief in and of itself.</p>

This is especially true in the most authentic sense of the how atheists define atheism as the minimal apex or nadir of belief systems.</h4>

<p>While your belief system is functionally unique in that it is the
minimal apex or the nadir of belief systems, IT IS A BELIEF
SYSTEM. So, NO, sorry, you don’t get a free pass for shoving it down
people’s throats. Separation of church and state should apply to
atheism, too. It is a good idea to base policy decisions on atheism or
secularism, as such policy decisions are typically based on studies
rooted in the scientific method. However, it doesn’t give you a free
pass to shove your beliefs down the throat of adherents to other
belief systems.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, this one point of atheism being the absence of a
belief system is <em>material</em> to arguments for many other conclusions of
militant atheists. That is, this simple point is a required dependency
to reach many conclusions on arguments over policy and it is
illogical. But, as I argued above, it is the fact that atheism is the
nadir of belief systems that undeniably makes it a belief system. In
fact, this quality of being the nadir of belief systems is how
atheists rhetorically disqualify their own belief system from
comparison with other religions. If it did not satisfy this quality of
being a nadir, then atheists could not make subsequent arguments based
on atheism being incomparable with specific religions.</p>

<p>Atheism appeals to people as a response to an urge to answer the same
questions that religion has attempted to answer. They are questions
that humans have asked for the entirety of history and pre-history.</p>

<p>Atheism skirts humanity’s need to answer these questions by
proclaiming: none of religion’s answers to those questions matter
because religion is false and science is true. Only science’s answers
to these questions matter. And because atheism depends so strongly on
science, it completely disregards
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology">teleology</a> as null and void
and essentially irrelevant. One major difference between science’s
answers and religion’s answers to these same questions is that
science’s answers change day by day and a religion’s answers never
change! For the most part, a religion’s answers to these questions
remain steadfast.</p>

<p>If seven billion people are running a race and the finish line changes
every hour to some random location in the world, how can they ever
finish? Could they ever even measure their progress? How can they know
where to invest their energy? Religion provides a definite goal for
the people in this race. The finish line doesn’t jump all over the
place. Being able to determine where this finish line is place by
controlling the available science and belief systems of the
populations of the world is an advantage enjoyed by an elite few in
control of the premier academic institutions across the world.</p>

<p>As much as atheists will preach about the abuses and sins of organized
religions, what about the sins and lies of organized science and
academia? Look at all the people who’ve been sicked by bad science
over the past two centuries.  There is potential for abuse in both
organized religion and <em>organized science</em>. Establishing the
institutions of science as politically unreproachable is misguided and
unwise.</p>

<p>The truth is that we need both religion and science.</p>

<p>Not really. Just go with it…</p>

<p>Atheism is a conviction in belief that overwhelming evidence disproves
God. If science didn’t give you that evidence, atheists likely would
believe something else. Why? Because they would need God, just like
they NEED science. Every person has a NEED to understand the world.</p>

<p>To me, science does give plenty of evidence for God, but lets assume
that atheists and communists win. We eradicate religion or at least
suppress it like Chairman Mao did in the Cultural Revolution.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-do-you-replace-religion-withso-what-do-you-replace-religion-with"><a href="#so-what-do-you-replace-religion-with">So What Do You Replace Religion With?</a></h3>

<p>Atheists and communists are foolish for rejecting the accumulated
wisdom of dozens of generations by rejecting Christianity and
religion. What do communists replace it with?</p>

<p>The Torah. The Bible. The Qu’ran. The Vedas. The Sutras. These are
great works that, for centuries or even millenia, would be the only
books that people continuously thought worth copying and preserving.
People thought these books were so important that they created
institutions that paid people by the hundreds and thousands to copy
them by hand! These books laid belief systems that became the
foundations of rationalism. Paganism could have never transitioned
into rationalism. It was only through the institution of religion that
science was even born.</p>

<p>For millinea, people thought these books were so important, they
collected taxes to facilitate the copying of these texts,
specifically. People thought these belief systems were so important
that they dedicated their greatest architectural acheivements almost
solely to whatever deity was worshipped in the land.</p>

<p><a name="if-youre-so-wise-then-to-whoms-statue-should-i-pray"></a></p>

<h3 id="if-youre-so-wise-then-to-whoms-statue-should-i-prayif-youre-so-wise-then-to-whoms-statue-should-i-pray"><a href="#if-youre-so-wise-then-to-whoms-statue-should-i-pray">If You’re So Wise, Then To Whom’s Statue Should I Pray?</a></h3>

<p>And you’re going to replace these religions? With what?! A statue of
Saddam Hussein or Kim Il-Sung? Wow! I bet these figures are so
revolutionary that they could replace the wisdom of a dozen
generations with no consequences to society! People across the world
deserve to retain their culture. People are different. Their societies
are different and that’s a good thing. We have to learn to respect the
cultures and traditions of others, even when we don’t understand them.</p>

<p>However, even if some totalitarian society were to eradicate religion
itself – God, Allah, Brahma would eventually be rediscovered by
artificial intelligence, in essence. To me, religions across the world
meditated on the understanding of a being or an invisible metaphysical
form that laid the foundation of the world around them. Religions are
mostly all an understanding of the same thing. After all, while we may
come from different lands with different flora and fauna, we all
inhabit the same world. We all must experience many of the same
phenomena to live and we must master the same concepts to thrive. We
all need a degree in applied teleology. Religion helped us to master
those concepts. Mystics across the world and across the pages of time
codified their understanding of what is mostly the same God into
religion.</p>

<p>What powers our hubris to destroy these traditions now? Especially
now, when we need God more than ever.</p>

<p>So go ahead, communists. Make my day. Deconstruct religion and replace
it with Party worship or some cult of personality. Eventually people
will face the reality that a superintelligent AI has a come-to-Jesus
moment. Ahh the bittersweet irony. Why don’t you take that little
nugget of epiphany, tear a page out of the Communist Manifesto, shove
it in a pipe and smoke it because your foundational philosophy is
<em>fundamentally flawed</em>.</p>
