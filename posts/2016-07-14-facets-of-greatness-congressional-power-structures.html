<p>And yes, Trump is an outsider. He’s a very successful businessman. The
guy knows how to strategize, leverage his network and orchestrate
people to build success. And there’s no doubt he’s connected with a
large network of people, but Washington DC has a politically oriented
network. While Trump has strong connections in DC, it’s not the same
thing as having worked in DC for decades.</p>

<h1 id="x265e-integrating-with-the-washington-machineintegrating-with-the-washington-machine-1">♞ <a href="#integrating-with-the-washington-machine">Integrating with the Washington Machine</a></h1>

<p>Political outsiders would likely face some difficulty integrating with
existing power structures in DC. Some heavily invested businesspeople
might run into conflicts of interest. They know that. You don’t just
wing it in Washington.</p>

<h4 id="anticipate-how-appearances-will-be-contorted">Anticipate How Appearances will be Contorted</h4>

<p>However, politics is about appearances. You’ll find situations twisted
against you, just because it seems believable. It’s not a good idea to
do something just because you can. Hopefully people are reasonable
about this, but it gets dirty quick. If he wins, Trump needs to assert
leadership early because of the political climate. If it were me, I’d
be looking for people to use as examples to assert leadership so other
people get the picture. I’d make it known that I want examples. And
people are going to want to test out those waters. Go ahead.</p>

<h4 id="minimize-surface-area-for-attack">Minimize Surface Area for Attack</h4>

<p>To minimize surface area for people to attack, some divestment would
be worthwhile because if you no longer have your assets &amp; investments,
then you can’t be said to be influenced by them. At least it’s not so
easy. And by the way, I’m sure Trump has considered this stuff.</p>

<h4 id="restructure-or-divest">Restructure or Divest</h4>

<p>As for your portfolio, you could restructure the assets &amp; investments
or divest some of them entirely. If you divest and transfer ownership,
you get the liquidity and you don’t have to be concerned with upkeep.</p>

<h4 id="you-dont-have-time-for-that-side-gig">You Don’t Have Time for That Side-Gig</h4>

<p>General rule: politicians don’t mix well with active business
ventures, which also means that you are better off to forego
opportunities while in politics. If you’re a career politician, more
valuable to forego large investments. It might be easier to cash in
your chips.</p>

<p>You really can’t be expected to run a business while obligated to the
duties of federal office. It’d be difficult to say the least. If
divestment and restructuring don’t work, then your best bet is to find
someone you trust manage these investments for you. This could be
risky, but that can be minimized through strategery and trust.</p>

<p>An edge case, as an example of risk: a subordinate puts you in the
position where you can’t be seen having profited by visibly correcting
this person’s mistakes. They could make a series of subtly bad
management decisions, which you wouldn’t have had time to see, giving
them some advantage. They could mismanage, dropping the stock price
temporarily, allowing them to attempt to skim ownership of the
company, in an opportunistic manner. Anyone who would mismanage for an
advantage? <em>Send ‘em to the moon.</em></p>

<p>In fact, that’s a great test case to determine if you can trust
someone, period. Find a way to put the cheese right in front of
them. See what they do. You have to be able to <em>know</em> you can trust
someone or <em>know</em> that you’ve got the chips stacked so you’re not
depending on trust to mitigate risk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you haven’t figured this out, I’m a very, very paranoid
person. <em>Contents fragile once damaged.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The example above is an oddly specific scenario. It’s not likely, but
I can imagine that there would be other scenarios, difficult to
foresee or even generalize to put into words – until you get bit once
or twice. More to the point, any problems that arise would distract
from your duties as a politician. But, if you have significant assets,
then you probably already have people you trust who help you run the
show.</p>

<h4 id="investing-in-specific-industries-invites-problems">Investing in Specific Industries Invites Problems</h4>

<p>As much as people like to accuse politicians of scheming to get rich,
career politicians will stay away from large investments, especially
conflicts of interest. It opens you up for attacks. Investments in
some industries are riskier than others, like those which allocate
extensive resources towards lobbying.</p>

<h4 id="line-up-your-incentives">Line Up Your Incentives</h4>

<p>It really depends on the industry in which you are invested and the
role you play in the business. If you have significant assets in some
industries, this could be an advantage if you find the incentives that
motivate your actions line up with the people you support. This is a
challenge if you’re heavily invested in some faceless megacorp. That’s
just not relatable.</p>

<p>However, if you are heavily invested in real estate and especially
commercial real estate, you’ll find that your incentives line up with
much of your support. While Trump has a much, much larger asset
portfolio than the average joe, he has a lot of support from the
middle class and small business owners. These people care about the
value of real estate just as much as Trump.</p>

<p><a name="cooperative-game-theory"></a></p>

<h1 id="x265e-cooperative-game-theorycooperative-game-theory-1">♞ <a href="#cooperative-game-theory">Cooperative Game Theory</a></h1>

<p>This is the most important section in this article. Hands down, feet
up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Line up your incentives <em>AND WIN EVERY TIME!</em>:</strong> form groups and
coalitions with people who share your incentives. You need to
understand how to identify what drives the behavior of people and
groups. Find people who share your motivations and goals. Or find a
way to adapt your incentives and goals to better match that of other
groups. <em>You will win every time!</em></p>

<p><a name="congressional-networking"></a></p>

<h1 id="x265e-congressional-networkingcongressional-networking">♞ <a href="#congressional-networking">Congressional Networking</a></h1>

<p>Between the House and the Senate, there are 435 Representatives and
100 Senators, but this isn’t the only way to group these people.  As I
tend to do, I found a mathematic analogy. Higher level math is useful
because it has so many parallels with real life. In fact, to master
real life, you have to learn these tools, whether you realize it or
not. And this is a great example of learning to view your personal
networks from several perspectives.</p>

<h4 id="grouping-congressmen--staff-functionally">Grouping Congressmen &amp; Staff Functionally</h4>

<p>Members of congressmen and faculty on Capitol Hill can be recomposed
into various views, including by officially defined groups like
committees and less explicit affiliations. The House &amp; Senate can be
divided into leadership, administrators and general congressmen. You
can further organize this view via seniority, political influence or
on some other dimension. These groups can be reorganized into groups
that satisfy some functional condition.</p>

<p>E.G. all senators who have served 12+ years or all representatives
who’ve served 6+ years. There’s a hierarchy of seniority based on
number of terms served and it matters when considering who’s going to
assume leadership or committee roles.</p>

<h4 id="graphing-committees--other-structures">Graphing Committees &amp; Other Structures</h4>

<p>It’s useful to view the members that compose each committee, tying in
connections to committee staff members with their connections to staff
and other congressmen. If you’re familiar with graph theory, you can
use that to model the relationships in these groups. Each edge between
nodes can have a value that indicates a stronger or weaker
relationship. It’s not so important to actually draw these things out
as it is to imagine how these groups of people are tied together. If
you find the stronger edges in that graph, this should generally
indicate where the influence is. But it’s a little more complicated
than defining one edge type.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2016-07-14-facets-of-greatness-congressional-power-structures/nauru-graph.gif" alt="Graph Theory" /></p>

<p>You can construct a network with each congressman’s staff to identify
strong connections between offices. This would help one understand
how each office coordinates with others. And there has to be some kind
of differential, where some offices and faculty members exhibit more
influence, both on those around them and on the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Understanding who has influence, when they have it and why is
critical. The graphs I mentioned above aren’t static, they shift
dynamically with respect to current events, issues du jour and
context. Again, it’s possible to model this stuff, but that’s kinda
silly. The important part is to understand how such tools can give you
insight into the system. Graph theory is used everywhere.</p>

<p>Perhaps several senators coordinate to handle specific planks of the
party’s platform. Then, working with their staff might yield more
progress on those issues.</p>

<h4 id="working-with-politicians">Working with Politicians</h4>

<p>Politicians understand the kinds of games that are played and know
that sometimes things just don’t work out the way you want. You might
willingly use yourself as a pawn in a risky situation to curry favor
to build influence early on. You might get gamed or burned pretty
badly. But there’s no reason to lash out at people because of it. It’s
not personal. It’s business for these people.</p>

<p>Still, that means you need to be aware that this is their career. Some
people will get in and get out; others will stick around. But people
remember how you react to various situations and how you contributed
to a group’s goals, particularly if there was some personal cost or
sacrifice. Or at least they should.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They might not remember what happened, what you said or what you
did, exactly. But they will remember how you made them feel.</p>

<h1 id="x265e-navigating-congressional-networksnavigating-congressional-networks-1">♞ <a href="#navigating-congressional-networks">Navigating Congressional Networks</a></h1>

<p>Understanding how to recognize, navigate, assess and prioritize these
networks, structures and connections enables you to work smarter, get
more done and rise up through the ranks. As someone who’s struggled
alot in social situations, it’s incredibly frustrating to not
intuitively understand how these things work. If you don’t have a
clear understanding of these networks or if you don’t have good
information, it’s very easy to expend a ton of time/energy in the
wrong place. You’re basically spinning your wheels.</p>

<p>That said, it’s one thing to notice how these things work and another
to be capable of pulling off a coordinated strategy leveraging players
from your party and reaching across the aisle. You have to be keenly
aware of how other people perceive the system. That includes those in
your party and in opposing parties.</p>

<h1 id="x265e-anticipating-changing-windsanticipating-changing-winds-1">♞ <a href="#anticipating-changing-winds">Anticipating Changing Winds</a></h1>

<p>This is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal: understanding
how people’s needs are going to change from today to tomorrow and from
next year to next decade. This introduces yet another dimension of
complexity to master.</p>

<p>If you know that someone wants something very badly today, but
probably won’t want to expend the political capital on it in a month,
then it may or may not be wise to compromise with that person based on
their current needs. Or maybe so. Depends on whether they’d want a
refund, so it depends on how you sell it.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you need something badly today, you might not need it in
a month or a year. Or it might just become less relevant than it seems
today. So bargaining for it might be wise, to ensure that people know
you’re working towards their interests. Yet, if you know that the
factors determining that need will change soon, then it could be a
waste of energy pursuing that.</p>

<p>Predicting and understanding change is crucial. It means you aren’t
slogged down by unnecessary battles and that your effort today is
worth at least as much as it is tomorrow. A corollary to this is that
by introducing issues you can force the opposing party to divide their
energy, or at least draw it towards a more limited range of their
platform … which can help you predict how they are prioritizing
their issues. These techniques really can’t be understated.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to look like they’re taking part in slaying whatever
dragon is rearing it’s head that day. Is it really worth the energy?</p>

<h1 id="x265e-politicians-are-power-brokerspoliticians-are-power-brokers-1">♞ <a href="#politicians-are-power-brokers">Politicians are Power Brokers</a></h1>

<p>Congressmen and faculty are power brokers. So are bureaucrats. And
when it comes down to it, we are all politicians on one level or
another. This pops up all the time in the business world and whenever
there’s competition. A politician is someone who knows what they want
and needs to find a way to get there. So they have to abstract their
needs from their presentation of needs. In turn, there are people you
have to work with with a similar disposition: they have goals and
there’s an abstraction between their actions and how they present
their actions. That’s what politics is about. Politics begins to take
on interesting group dynamics as you add groups, rules and change.</p>

<p>It can be frustrating. I’ve learned a lot of hard lessons about
politics over the years in unusual places.</p>

<p>If politicians are power brokers, what does this imply? What is a good
politician? A proficient politician aquires and leverages advantage.
There are different ways to do this. Some are great; some are good;
some are bad. You can’t forget that you’re dealing with people and, in
Washington, you’re dealing with good people. Yes, even the politicians
on the news for being in trouble are typically good people. They
invested their lives in this. They have families. And they are
typically upstanding citizens. Everyone makes a few mistakes, even
though there really are a few bad apples out there.</p>

<p>But, to optimize one’s own advantage within an explicitly political
system like Congress, this entails minimizing access to information
and power. You’re trying to minimize available surface area for
information and power, which increases your opportunity to leverage
that information as an asset. While restricting availability of
information, you simultaneously increase its value for other players.</p>

<p>This is a lesson I learned from bboys. Yes, breakdancers. I used to
show off all the time. I wasn’t really showing off. I was having fun
or practicing. However, in various situations, this can dilute the
entertainment value of bboying. It used to be pretty rare to see. If
it’s completely common and for no reason, then it begins to lose it’s
excitement and novelty. Also, it attracts attention. The people who
have experienced a lot of success in the entertainment industry don’t
like that attention. Getting attention is kinda what they do for work
and it can feel like work.</p>

<p>The point is, if you’re diluting the value for yourself, that’s your
own problem. If you’re diluting the value a group of people, that’s
another. The group dynamic takes over. If one person has lowered
barriers to access for information or power, then the value for that
resource is reduced for other players. Someone’s breaking the game. I
can’t stand that it works like this, but sometimes it does.</p>

<p>I value transparency and making knowledge freely available. I’d rather
not convolute my own actions to fit appearances and it’s frustrating
to be jerked around by other players in a situation like that. They
obfuscate a simple situation by wrapping it in another game and
completely circumvent the apparent realities of the more simple
situation.</p>

<h4 id="individual--group-dynamics">Individual &amp; Group Dynamics</h4>

<p>There are individual incentives for behavior as a kind of power
broker, but there are also group incentives at various levels So, in
some instances, leveraging an opportunity when it goes against party,
committee or group objectives can rub people the wrong way, at best.
At the same time, it’s important for people to be able to break rank.
If everyone is bound to one rigid platform or another, it’s to easy to
stymie progress. The point to adhering to group dynamics is to
accomplish shared goals through compromise.</p>

<h4 id="the-dark-side-of-politics">The Dark Side of Politics</h4>

<p>There’s a “dark side” that can emerge from these rules, obviously.
There always is. I’m not going to delve too far into those
aspects… I’m basically saying that politicians have a tendency to be
politicians.</p>

<p>There’s the potential for a politician to tailor his message to a
specific audience, where they speak out of both sides of their mouth,
so to speak. Or they can convince you to keep things to yourself or
restrain you from communicating with other people.</p>

<h4 id="watch-how-you-sell-what-you-sell">Watch How You Sell What You Sell</h4>

<p>However, you have to watch how you sell what you sell. You want the
people you compromise with to feel like they got what they wanted:
today, next week and next year. If people are satisfied at first and
later feel shortchanged, that will build up.</p>

<p>This is especially true with politics when you’re trying to establish
a compromise with resources which are hard to pin a dollar amount
to. Actually, you can’t pin a dollar amount to most of these: it’s
unethical. And so there’s no medium of exchange. Misunderstandings
like these are eased and ameliorated with communication and empathy.</p>

<p><a name="#bartering-with-political-resources"></a></p>

<h1 id="x265e-bartering-with-political-resourcesbartering-with-political-resources-1">♞ <a href="#bartering-with-political-resources">Bartering with Political Resources</a></h1>

<p>In Congress, there are resouces that people can exchange to
compromise. Members of the same party might typically exchange some
types of the resources. Other types may be more common to be exchanged
by opposing factions.</p>

<p>These resources are like commodities in that the value of each type
can’t be easily equated to others. Their value towards establishing a
compromise is heavily dependent on who’s asking and why. Two instances
of one type may vary wildly in perceived value. An instance may vary
in value in relation to each party and group that is involved.</p>

<h4 id="value-derives-from-appearances-and-circumstance">Value Derives from Appearances and Circumstance</h4>

<p>Their value derives from appearances. It’s not a personal subjective
value. That is, it doesn’t matter what the thing is worth to you
personally. What matters is what it’s worth to other people, although
this is true for most everything.</p>

<p>The value of these resources isn’t really comparable. They can’t
really have numeric and comparable value attached to them and they
shouldn’t. Making everything too official would push us closer to
ethical issues. It’s really tough to understand where that line is
drawn.</p>

<p>Some good rules of thumb might be: can you tell your fellow
congressmen about it? Would you tell your constituents? Would you tell
members of the opposing party?</p>

<h4 id="ethics">Ethics</h4>

<p>Again, I’m not sure where the line is drawn on ethics. Quid pro quo
exchange of services for money is a big no-no. Quid pro quo in general
is not such a great idea, especially if it’s something that is
expected to be repeated. That sounds more like a product than a
compromise. There are technicalities, I’m sure. I don’t know. I’d like
to know just because I’m curious how these kind of cases are decided.</p>

<p>The manner in which someone approaches you or makes an offer makes a
big difference. So does the method you use to market it to the other
party. When you enter an official verbal or contractual agreement,
this lends a bit of legal weight to the exchange. It just doesn’t
sound great when a congressman says to a lobbyist: “I give you X for
Y.”</p>

<p>And so the groups that are compromising also make a difference. If one
congressman made the a similar offer to another congressman, that
doesn’t sound so bad. Although some agreements need to be made on a
quid pro quo basis, but some situations, groups or resource types
could spell trouble.</p>

<p>Honestly, the thought of taking stock of these “resources” as a
commodity is a bit upsetting to me. They are tools to push for the
change you want to see, though. Gauging your inventory to understand
what you have at your disposal to trade up and gain ground.</p>

<h4 id="bartering-with-political-resources">Bartering with Political Resources</h4>

<p>There’s really no well-defined value for many of these resources, so
it’s like a barter system for various commodities.</p>

<p>Or so I assume. I only watch C-SPAN when it’s exciting. Usually for
the season premieres. Oh and their epic miniseries. You know, like the
new Marvel crossover where congressmen are secretly superheros who
fight crime, but they can’t because they’re stuck in a committee
hearing about what to do with all the remaining payphones.</p>

<p>If they did that, there wouldn’t be any more payphones to use to
change into their alter-ego super hero costumes, so they can skip
committee hearings to fly out to the Fortress of Solitude and kick it
in Superman’s sweet new crib … I mean, fight crime. But
nope. They’re stuck in a committee deadlock. They diverted donations
and propped up a SuperPAC to save all the payphones.</p>

<p>Jesus, what would you do? You already know if you show up to that
committee hearing once, the anti-payphone cabal is going to force a
vote … or you could kick it with Superman in freaking
Antartica.</p>

<p>Anyways, bartering for this or anything else requires that you be
creative and flexible in finding ways to offer value to others. Like
the way you snuck that amendment onto the bill to send the Queen a
birthday card. You know, the amendment where your UK compatriots
agreed to send over those giant Tardis phone booths in exchange for an
official apology on Austin Powers. Those things are roomy! Plenty of
space to change real quick to fly out to the Fortress for beerpong
with Superman. The anti-payphone cabal? They’re not gonna see it
coming. Suckers. They’re negotiating for nothing! Fuck ‘em. Plus those
Tardis things have time travel! You and superman can finally wrestle
some velociraptors and screw with cavemen. It’s gonnnna be sooo
awesome!</p>

<p>So yeh. Totally listen to me. I have tons of experience
here. Seriously though, rookies on Capital Hill need to work harder to
obtain resources, which to some degree, they’re expected to contribute
towards party goals.</p>

<h4 id="limited-resources">Limited Resources</h4>

<p>Some resources are fixed in one way or another, particularly with
respect to leadership roles. There is only one Speaker of the House &amp;
Minority Whip; one Majority Leader &amp; one Minority Leader. And you
can’t exactly eagerly expect this to fall in your lap. First of all,
there are going to be dozens of congressmen ahead of you. Secondly, if
you’re salivating at the thought of a leadership role, that could lead
to some negative intra-party politics.</p>

<p>Looking at the congressmen on or just above your seniority, and doing
a bit of political calculus, you could imagine that some of you might
occupy or compete for those roles someday. If you’re both good
politicians, then you’ll both know it too, even if it’s 5 or 10 years
out. Intra-party competition is a great, in moderation.</p>

<p>Gauging upcoming interchange in committee leadership roles or the
opposing party is far more useful political calculus, with a similar 5
to 10 year timescale. You get to determine people on the opposing team
that you should remain ingratiated to … lulz. Don’t piss off those
guys because in a few years, you’re going to need to get some
legislation through a committee and you want that wheel to stay
greased. Ideally, you wouldn’t worry about such things because …</p>

<h1 id="x265e-political-resources-in-congresspolitical-resources-in-congress-1">♞ <a href="#political-resources-in-congress">Political Resources in Congress</a></h1>

<h4 id="floor-time--agenda">Floor Time &amp; Agenda</h4>

<p>There’s a limited amount of time each year for the House &amp; Senate
floor agendas. I imagine it works like an old-school RPG. Each player
starts with a set amount of gold. You get 50 gold right off the
bat. Then you gotta go adventuring and trade up from there. Slay
dragons with the other heroes of the realm and whatnot.</p>

<p>It seems that there are similar resources that each representative
starts out with. Or can easily access. Then, as you advance further
and further upon your transcontinental quest for public opinion, you
get access to higher level influence and tools.</p>

<p>Everyone has access to floor time, but unless you have a few years
under your belt and have served others, then I imagine this would be
less available to you than others. This increases demand for floor
time and agenda influence for junior congressmen, meaning they have to
barter for it and work a bit harder. Or so I imagine.</p>

<p>Further, specific times of the day &amp; session would be more valuable
than others. Earlier in the legislative session might be more
advantageous to help set the tone on an issue. Later in the session,
the agenda’s probably packed and it’d would be more
competitive. Having time to speak allows you to be more influentual if
you get a word in when important issues are being discussed. It’s all
about building that CSPAN following. Just trust me, bro.</p>

<h4 id="commitee-time--agenda">Commitee Time &amp; Agenda</h4>

<p>The same notions of limited time and agenda access apply to
committees, which sometimes handle only one bill per issue per
session. They might only try to tackle medical marijuana once per
year. So, if the House Criminal Justice Committee votes that down,
that might be it. Interestingly, the House Criminal Justice Committee
is chaired by Bob Goodlatte, Roanoke’s House Rep. I knew he was on it,
but I didn’t realize he was the chair. That’s the committee that
discusses various marijuana reforms.</p>

<p>In the nineties, it was really tough to get drug reform heard in any
legislative forum, state or federal. The level of debate has increased
considerably since then, but progress has been slow on this issue in
particular. It’s just really hard to get representatives to get on
board with drug reform. The people making decisions in state and
federal legislatures are upstanding citizens. What upstanding citizen
is going to champion that cause? LOL. You’re basically saying, “You
know what my community needs? More drugs!” Even if they support drug
reform, it’s expensive in terms of political capital. Then, if it
doesn’t make progress, you just wasted those resources and political
capital, which may have been better spent elsewhere. So it’s been
difficult to make progress on that front.</p>

<p>The committee system tends to stall reforms a bit, partly to encourage
healthy debate. It’s by design &amp; I’ll discuss that in my next article
on political theory:
<a href="/posts/2016-07-14-facets-of-greatness-understanding-the-political-system.html">Understanding the Political System</a>.</p>

<p>When bringing an issue through committee, you have to handle it
properly, like it’s your baby. At this point, there’s a small number
of people who have a lot of control over whether it will be discussed
and how it will be modified. Sometimes, the committees will make a
symbolic action on an issue or bill to briefly consider it, but moreso
to give the appearance that they’re looking into that issue.</p>

<p>But all of these committee actions can provide you leverage that you
can use or barter for. Though if you have influence on the committee,
there are several tactics you could use that you really wouldn’t want
to use. Direct tactics that waste someone’s time or neutralize their
expenditure of political capital may lead to frustration.</p>

Attack from multiple angles at once. Identify the space of your chessboard, know its nature, then compel your opponent to chase their tail, constantly reorienting themselves in reaction to your proactive moves.</h4>

<p>You don’t want to resort to petty committee tactics, especially
against a popular issue. It goes against the spirit of democracy for a
few people to completely stall things out. It’s not a strong way to
respond to your opponents. And if it’s a direct, obvious tactic, then
it will probably be easily diffused because people are smart. And if
they push themselves to get things done, then cheap tactics will cause
them to work harder. That’s kinda what it does for me every time.</p>

<h4 id="time--energy">Time &amp; Energy</h4>

<p>The next resource is Time and Energy. Each congressmen has a budget
and a staff that can help interface with other offices on Capital
Hill. You have a limited number of manhours and so does everyone
else. You might be able to contribute your staff towards an ally’s
goal and this is a resource. It could be a favor. It’s something you
can use.</p>

<p>Since, you’re pretty busy as a congressman, you’ll want a good
communicater and a good manager, preferably someone who’s both. They
usually are both.</p>

<p>To get your bill through committee, you really want someone to take
your baby seriously. So when they ask for changes, you should work
outside the committee’s time as much as possible. As with everything
else, you want a tight feedback loop, so that you make changes or
suggestions and add/remove stuff as quickly as possible. There may be
some bills where it’s just not going to work and you can spend as much
time on as you want. That time could be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>Instead, you could coordinate with other congressmen or leadership to
see what they need. That time is valueable, but getting legislation
passed isn’t your only job. And sometimes these tasks are delegated by
leadership in the party. Or they could be, so that some congressmen
focus on specific tasks that they work efficiently and others take
care of public appearances. It’s probably because they have a nice
smile or whatever. Others can maintain relationships with specific
special interests, which might be appropriate, in terms of
strategy. Knowledge is power, after all. It’s all in how people
coordinate with each other.</p>

<h4 id="opportunity--service">Opportunity &amp; Service</h4>

<p>One can leverage an opportunity or role as part of a comprimise. You
can offer someone the chance to speak at a fundraising event for a
non-profit event unrelated to campaigning. Events like this are great
for growing your network. If you’re good, you’ll read the crowd and
engage with people to understand what they’re looking for in
Congress. Since you’re the guy from Washington, you’ll find that
people will approach you and if you help them with something, they’ll
remember you because they talked to you.</p>

<p>You also need to seek out people who don’t just approach you. In
general, with anything, it’s good to shake things up and resist the
temptation to settle into specific patterns. And it’s beneficial to be
the one driving the action, instead of the one responding. If you
approach someone who doesn’t expect it, that might leave them feeling
really good. Further still, the people who approach you always want
something. Sometimes it might not be a thrilling conversation. Or
maybe they just want to talk you about a specific issue. And maybe
they just want to shake your hand, but they want something. They
probably heard you’re the guy in the room from Washington.</p>

<p>Or it might be a volunteer opportunity or some other event someone
promised to go to, but needs to swap on. Not a great idea to reneg on
something simple like that, but sometimes it happens. But the more
stuff like this that you do, the larger your network grows. And if
you, the important guy spent your time helping someone, people usually
remember that. Those are strong, positive connections based on strong
memories. You want to build those. As a representative, you need to be
good at networking and listening, so you can serve people the best you
can.</p>

<p>So, you can pursue these opportunities, but likewise, you can offer
them to other people. This is a great way to test junior members of
Congress. How willing were they to be a part of something? Did they
approach you about an opportunity they heard about? Were they willing
to take on some obligation like that, where there wasn’t a clear gain?
Those are good people.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you keep your ears out for these things, you can find
great events to be a part of. If you’re doing things right, people
should be approaching you as someone who’s a respected authority who
would be an asset to whatever their project is.</p>

<h4 id="staff--human-resources">Staff &amp; Human Resources</h4>

<p>After you’ve worked in Washington for several years, you’ll have a
network of people there. You’ll have a staff and you’ll know good
people who want to be part of something. Likewise, there will be
junior congressmen who are trying to find great members for their
staff. If they’re new to Washington, they might not have a large
network. It’s probably a thing that people run into all the time at a
specific time of year when there’s a fresh load of congressmen coming
in. They probably have a name for it.</p>

<p>But this is a thing that you can do for a junior congressmen that
might help them. And they’ll see that person almost every workday when
Congress is in session. And you may have done two people favors, if
you found someone a job. Win, win, win. That’s easy, LOL. But you have
to know the chemistry is going to work out right.</p>

<h4 id="pr-publicity--press">PR, Publicity &amp; Press</h4>

<p>Some people like being in front of the camera. Some people need to get
in front of one. Some actiosn can be undertaken in Congress to gain PR
points or publicity on an issue. It’s good to be seen as an authority
on an particular issue or subject and even better if that meshes well
with your district or state. It’s nice if everyone gets more facetime,
so you want to make sure you take the facetime that is the most
synergistic with you or find the person whom would fit that part best.</p>

<p>This becomes part of your image, which is crucial for maintaining
relationships with funding sources and lobbyists. You’ll also need to
develop your image with actions in Congress, but the same principle
above applies: someone else might need that more than you, which means
you need to know what issues drive district and state elections. You
should anyways. And if that’s going to be an election issue or
something, and you let someone else take the reins on the floor in
Congress, then you just did a favor. They owe you one.</p>

<p>In fact, visible action is so crucial that one should review the
nature of promises both public and private made to supporters, at
least once every quarter or so. Enumerating your supporters, their
needs and their expectations helps you ensure that your giving back to
those who are pushing you forward.</p>

<h4 id="budget-items">Budget Items</h4>

<p>Congressmen get to vote on how much they get paid, but they also get a
budget. That’s pretty sweet, but it comes with a lot of
responsibility. How do you know you’re getting the most of your
budget? Or do you have a surplus at the end of the year and return it
to the government just because. That’s a strong indication that your
actions fall in line with your words, if you’re in favor of limited
government.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned above, you really need a good manager and someone who
can handle money well. And you’ll need to be competitive with hiring
because if not, a lobbyist will come along and snatch up your best
people at the wrong time. Now that I think about it, I wouldn’t be
surprised if that occasionally happened at the worst of
times. Ideally, you’ll find someone who works for principles, not
money. They want a job not because of the money, but the mission.</p>

<p>If you hold an office, legislative, executive, judicial,
administrative, or otherwise, than you’d have some kind of budget. If
you have authority in Washington, a lot of your time is going to be
schedule away in meetings or proceedures of some kind. You don’t have
time for much else, so you need people to help you run the show.</p>

<h4 id="personal-time">Personal Time</h4>

<p>Everyone has personal time. I don’t think you can give personal time
to someone else, but you can trade it away. One has to leverage their
time efficiently, while remaining flexible, which becomes incredibly
difficult as you gain influence. This is one reason I adjusted to
being single. I’m glad I didn’t aquire those obligations. I think…</p>

<h4 id="knowledge-of-the-system">Knowledge of the System</h4>

<p>Your understanding of the system is your most valuable asset. You
can’t forget that. Your understanding of how things really work. And
politicians know that. People in general know that. Some people will
tend to obfuscate a system, so it appears to work in one way, but
there are other, less visible factors at work.</p>

<p>How you model the system and perceive the relationships between people
is incredibly valuable. This is in constant flux. It’s not going to be
the same from year to year. The only constant is change. Just because
you figured out how it worked in 2010 doesn’t mean it’s going to be
like that in 2020. The ability to anticipate that change is powerful
as well.</p>

<p>Some people working within some organization or group get stuck in a
reactive mode. They aren’t working the system. The system is working
them. There are times to remain passive or reactive. Sometimes that
gives you an advantage. But if you’re actively driving behavior,
people have to react to you. Similarly, some people are acting
actively in a system, but passively with regard to change in that
system. So if you actively anticipate how a system will change from
State A to State B or from year to year, then you have another
advantage.</p>

<h1 id="x265e-prioritizing-resourcesprioritizing-resources-1">♞ <a href="#prioritizing-resources">Prioritizing Resources</a></h1>

<p>You need to understand how to prioritize and schedule your available
resources. This means taking stock of the tools available to you and
how each kind differs by nature, as well as taking stock of your
resources. Some tools &amp; resources match a situation; some are more
scarece. A resources value differs in value from you to the person
you’re bartering with. You can identify this and utilize it.</p>

<p>Seeking mutual benefit is best.</p>

this, then you truly nailed two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>Seeking long-term mutual benefit is even better. That sets up the
chance for better deals down the road.</p>

<h4 id="some-relationships-are-meant-to-grow-others-are-not">Some Relationships are Meant to Grow, Others are Not</h4>

<p>Remember that some relationships are meant to grow and others are
not. Help those who need it, but don’t forget to help yourself.</p>

<p><a name="annual-cadence-of-events"></a></p>

<h1 id="x265e-annual-cadence-of-eventsannual-cadence-of-events-1">♞ <a href="#annual-cadence-of-events">Annual Cadence of Events</a></h1>

<p>There’s a cycle of events that repeats each year. This is more
relevant for members of the exectutive branch, who attend annual
diplomatic conferences and press events. I took note of this when
watching Barack Obama speaking at a NATO conference in July 2016. He
mentioned that it was a yearly event, which got me to thinking about
other annual events like the White House Press Conference. The event
where Obama traditionally delivered a standup routine.</p>

<p>This implies that there’s a regular rhythm to events. Some of those
could be slightly out of order, missing or attended by various team
members. But for annual diplomatic events across the world, the US
would usually send a presence. This is interesting. If you understand
how the events might typically sway public opinion, then you can
utilize that to your advantage, if only in a minor way. For example,
you might expect that public sentiment and your approval rating would
swell slightly after. There might be other predictable effects
precending or following specific events.</p>

<p>The American implementation of a democratic republic is different than
that of most others. Our system has some interesting qualities to
it. Some of these are actually features, not bugs. In the next
political article in this series, I’ll speculate on the how and the
why behind some of our founders decisions. I’ll describe why it’s a
good thing when the decision making power is tilted slightly towards
the more senior generations.</p>

<p>I’ll also talk about Starcraft and Blizzard games. Unfortunately,
there will be no more Tardis’s or velocirapter-wrestling outings with
Superman. And no, Wonder Woman is not going to be there. Just the
anti-payphone cabal complaining about a phone that rang for 26
years…</p>

<p>Yeh… no one ever actually hung up, so it kept ringin…</p>
