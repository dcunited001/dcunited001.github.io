          <p>Communication is signaling and vice versa, but signaling is more
indirect.  To me, signaling encompasses incidental communication of
your organization’s intentions through purchasing agreements, real
estate purchases, intellectual property registration and startup
acquisitions.  It never ceases to amaze me the lengths that companies
will go through to cover their tracks, sometimes.  Then there are
other instances where a major company is obviously signaling towards a
major investment of their resources and I wonder why they wanted to
make that knowledge public. I wish I could be a part of those
discussions because I’m sure they have good reasons.</p>

<p>The best example of signaling I can think of is the great lengths that
the US and UK undertook to surprise Germany with the invasion location
for DDay, known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat">Operation Mincemeat</a>.
There were two major possibilities for DDay invasion.  The UK
conspired to have a cadaver available before the invasion and send it
floating to shore at the alternate location.  This was a day or so
before the invasion in Normandy.  This signaled to Hitler that Germany
should concentrate its forces southward in preparation of invasion
there and ordered much of their land forces away from Normandy.  If it
weren’t for this tactical use of signaling, the UK and US would have
suffered massively larger losses in DDay.  The story is even more
fascinating when you hear all the details.  Definitely worth it.</p>

<p>This story underscores the importance of understanding how your
actions affect the behavior of others.  Any great strategy must take
signaling into account.  Quite often, taking signaling into account
sometimes significantly obfuscates an otherwise simple strategy.  If
you’re trying to throw off your opponent in chess, this could result
in a several move delay before you position the piece you actually
wanted.  In order for it to be useful, you need to understand how your
opponent plays the game, whether they understand a particular strategy
and how they might react to such a strategy.</p>

<p><a name="if-actions-speak-louder-than-words"></a></p>

<h4 id="then-reactions-are-crystal-clear">Then Reactions are Crystal Clear</h4>

<p>Energy committed towards any action is a good measure for weighting an
opponent’s intent behind an action. Here, energy implies cost of some
kind: money, redirection of resources, utilization of assets.  Gauging
the opportunity cost in pursuing a plan of action is an even better
measure of whether or not an opponent’s move can be read to imply
associated intent.  Because signaling is so important, everyone and
especially larger corporations wants to mask their intent behind
actions.</p>

<p>You can also gauge intent behind actions by attempting to place your
opponent into a scenario where you hope their reaction will belie
their tactics or overall strategy.  Mastery of this technique confers
almost psychic ability. It can also turn you into someone who appears
to be a controlling asshole, incapable of trust.  Yet, the potential
for trust itself is often the unfortunate victim of success. People in
high-stakes scenarios can’t leave themselves to fickle vulnerabilities
like trust.  There are some scenarios where the only acceptable level
of risk is zero. Nothing is impossible.</p>

<p><a name="reading-corporate-action"></a></p>

<h3 id="reading-corporate-actionreading-corporate-action"><a href="#reading-corporate-action">Reading Corporate Action</a></h3>

<p>For the same reason that it’s smart to employ a lawyer during trial,
it’s smart to shield your actions behind a corporation.  To the dismay
of Bernie supporters everywhere, corporations have rights – which is
ironic because apparently you can’t even read the Bill of Rights
through everything smeared on it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quick sidenote: I have tried so hard to escape the rhetorical dead
end of defending our rights, but honestly it seems that we have to
choose between our freedom and our resilience as a society.  It’s
purely a result of technology’s unprecedented power and
unpredictability.  But IMO, it’s borderline criminal to maintain the
illusion of freedom if we are not free, simply because it’s
useful. The American Dream – the promise of freedom and opportunity
– is not a tool. No hard feelings. Moving on… . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In business, purchasing a company or real estate could signal your
intentions to your competitors.  Furthermore, prices of stocks and
commodities can signal the reactions of entities in a particular
industry.  If you know that industry and you understand the decision
making process for the players in that game, you can understand how
actions which weren’t initiated by one of those players could indicate
changes in their behavior. Public companies are at a much greater risk
of being “read” because so much more information is either available
publicly or to stockholders.</p>

<p><a name="signaling-for-founders"></a></p>

<h3 id="signaling-for-founderssignaling-for-founders"><a href="#signaling-for-founders">Signaling for Founders</a></h3>

<p>As for founders and great leaders, they seem to prefer to not signal
at all – which would be boring in my opinion.  For founders of
companies, it’s smart to generally turn down the volume on your
emotional reactions.  For people in other industries, the opposite
could be true – 24/7 poker face is a bad thing.  For many people,
it’s just their personality and it’s sad because they’ve succumbed to
the game.  They have literally become the game they play. But it’s
smart.</p>

<p>In general, I’ve noticed that founders and other greats tend to dull
their emotional response during long form interviews.  They don’t want
to signal anything at all.  This could be because of the risk of
sending the wrong message.  Confusion can be more difficult to quell
than it is useful, especially if you want to convey a uniform message.
For some roles and industries, it seems more important to remain
reserved, though not withdrawn. Higher volume emotional responses
could detract from the important pieces of your message, if it’s an
intellectual one. Some people will latch onto anything you give them
that they can contort to attack you.  Sometimes it’s better not to
give anyone anything at all.</p>

<p>If you’re someone who has a considerable amount of influence, you
really have to watch your words and actions because you can create
more of an effect than you expect.  This is especially true if other
people want to use your words and actions for their own purposes or
without your knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="no-dali-you-cant">No Dali, You Can’t!</h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2016-05-13-facets-of-greatness-signaling-if-actions-speak-louder/dali-la-main.jpg" alt="Dali's Manus" /></p>

<h4 id="if-only-dali-had-known">If only Dali had known…</h4>

<p>So you’ll see these founders and especially celebrities will restrain
their words and actions simply because of that.  It is a gag, where
you are bound by fame.  Isn’t that crazy?  You obtain influence and
then choose to bind yourself out of fear.  It’s crucial to understand
why it is important to do so.  The wrong tweet or the wrong post could
really hurt someone, even if that’s never what you meant at all. The
solution to this is to maintain some level of anonimity with your
actions.  If you are an angel investor or celebrity who’s scoping out
new talent, find someone close who you trust to help do this for you.
Another advantage to this is that the person you’re scoping out is
much more likely to be themselves. As long as the person you’re
delegating to is someone with a sharp eye and you know you can trust
that person, then you are more likely to get an accurate picture of
someone else’s behavior and character.</p>

<h4 id="and-the-corollary">And the Corollary:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>For those of you who want to be “discovered” – it is paramount that
you not only stay true to yourself, but also be sure to develop into
a version of your true self who is approachable, ethical and
<em>remarkable</em>. How would someone describe you to your heroes? I have
failed so many times here…</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="coordinate-signaling"></a></p>

<h1 id="coordinated-signalingcoordinate-signaling-1"><a href="#coordinate-signaling">Coordinated Signaling</a></h1>

<p>Founders need to prevent people from resolving and deducing more
information based on their reactions, especially if they’re involved
in a competitive space.  Additionally, when a founder has established
business partnerships, unintentionally signalling the wrong thing can
adversely affect your partners. Someone could prompt you with a
seemingly harmless question and a founder needs to know how to
respond, while taking into account their own interests and the
interests of their partners.  They need to take these factors into
account a priori and know what questions could be asked.  Situations
like this, even when someone didn’t intend harm with their reaction
could cause significant problems for other people or partners.</p>

<p>This coordinated signaling is incredibly important in politics, where
individuals need to adhere to a party platform.  It’s vital to be
yourself – I have sacrificed so many opporuntities in pursuit of this
– but it’s crucial to understand that there is nothing truly great
that you can accomplish on your own.  It’s by comprimising with others
that our energy can be combined and we can accelerate towards a
destination that would otherwise be impossibly remote.  This is
another phenomena where one must find the right balance.  It’s also
frustrating when group motivation to resist change derided as
“outlandish” results in the dismantling of any dissenter. Standing up
for what you believe in isn’t easy, but it’s worth it. When you
realize how much someone has to give up to do so, you should respect
that person, in spite of whether you agree with what they stand for.
It’s very hard to be that person.</p>

<p>Keeping business partnerships in mind when talking about signaling
from a organizational perspective is more complicated.  Agreements
with business partners may require that you coordinate signalling in a
market – though the text of such an agreement wouldn’t call it that.
This could be unethical, depending on how it’s used and how you
coordinate.</p>

<p>Businesses may pursue strategies employed <em>solely</em> to see how a
competitor reacts to better understand how signaling affects their
competitor’s behavior.  From this, they can make inferences about
their competitor’s strategy.  While I specifically mentioned <em>solely</em>,
this isn’t true – no strategy is employed for a single explicit
purpose in business.</p>

<p><a name="great-people-with-no-small-plans"></a></p>

<h3 id="great-people-with-no-small-plansgreat-people-with-no-small-plans"><a href="#great-people-with-no-small-plans">Great People with No Small Plans</a></h3>

<p>Great people with no small plans have a clear distinction b/w what
info can be shared and what should remain private. The understand what
inferences can be made with each new piece of info.  This is
incredibly important because any great project requires great plans.
Everyone, or almost everyone, would love to build something great.  So
have you to conceal your intentions, your strategies and your
motivations.  Because, at best, someone else will end up building what
you had planned.  Or a competitor will sidestep and adapt to your
strategy, rendering it useless.  Or just a massive waste of time.</p>

<p>This is why signaling is so important.  The kind of people who end up
being truly great have an intimate understand of signaling.  They
understand how to read the actions of others and what message to send.
They know what questions to ask and what not to ask and the
implications of making particular statements.  They understand
motivations behind their own actions and their colleagues actions.</p>

<p><a name="getting-from-a-to-b"></a></p>

<h3 id="getting-from-a-to-bgetting-from-a-to-b"><a href="#getting-from-a-to-b">Getting from A-to-B</a></h3>

<h4 id="signaling-overcomplicates-everything">Signaling Overcomplicates Everything</h4>

<p>In a world where you’re passionate about getting from A-to-B to
accomplish whatever goal you have, it’s disheartening that signaling,
far more than any other facet, obfuscates that path from A-to-B.
Signaling is overcomplicated – honestly anything involving other
people is – and it is very perplexing for someone with Asperger’s.
For someone who intellectually understood so many things and often
clearly outperformed competition, my lack of social understanding and
especially that of signaling precluded me from being capable of
accomplishing much of anything until my late twenties.  I’m still
dealing with the consequences of those mistakes, but everything that
has held me back has taught me so much.  And the harder people hold me
back and refuse to acknowledge the significance of what I discuss or
work on only drives me to work harder.</p>

<p>It’s humourous, IMO, when people tell me I’ll never succeed with a
startup. <strong>For some of those people</strong>, all roads lead to Rome: that
is, they refuse to do anything that would contribute to my success,
<em>which is bullshit</em>.  It’s like that logic paradox, where you know
that one person always tells the truth and one person always
lies. There are some people who I can know to always drive me away
from my goals.  For them, it is a foregone conclusion that I have
failed or will fail, when I have never even had seed funding.  Again,
<em>it is absolute bullshit.</em></p>

<p>And then I look bad when I’m not cordial with someone like this? Now
that is a fucking challenge. However, in my position, it’s a serious
mistake to judge anyone who’s giving me a hard time, as they are
usually someone who should be a friend and ally, but is acting towards
me after being misinformed or led to utilize a fallacious
perspective.  Honestly, I don’t get it. I would invest in me. I would
cofound a company with me if I thought my skillset meshed up. That is
what is so confusing: everyone around me acts as though my fate is a
foregone conclusion, without ever discussing why … and why is that?</p>

<p><a name="yeh-my-attitude-is-real-lame"></a></p>

<h3 id="yeh-my-attitude-is-real-lameyeh-my-attitude-is-real-lame"><a href="#yeh-my-attitude-is-real-lame">… Yeh, My Attitude is Real Lame</a></h3>

<h4 id="trust-me-i-know">Trust me. I Know!</h4>

<p>And it also sounds really lame that I would complain, especially when
there are so many people who have presented me with opportunities that
I would complain, but there it is.  The trouble is, people will only
lend you a helping hand for so long.  People often want to help
because they want to be able to tell a story about how they were
involved in someone’s situation and exhibited positive influence.  If
you fail several times when someone was only trying to help you,
they’re going to want to steer their efforts to someone else. For
someone that needs help climbing out of a hole, it’s important to
remember that there are plenty people out there who want to help, but
if it <em>appears</em> that you’re just screwing around, then they’re going
to want to help someone else.  Again, it’s irritating for me to find
myself in the position where I’m isolated and a handful of people
control which pieces of information are shared and how that info about
me is shared.</p>

<p>Also, those who exhibit the greatest strengths in spite of great
difficulties are great examples of heroes in the kind of stories we
should be telling. In other words, if someone is just handed success
because they bitched loudly about things, that’s not a great story to
tell.  At the same time, I don’t think it’s right to preclude someone
from having a shot just because a few things went horribly wrong. I
don’t really know what to say about it. Some people tell me I haven’t
worked hard enough, without actually understanding the crap that I’ve
been through in the past decade.  I can’t drive, that’s just a
recurring theme in my life.  So, yes, there are opporunities in front
of me, but I just end up spending all my energy figuring out how to
physically travel somewhere. And usually when I try to take advantage
of these opportunities, I often have to involve one of those people
for whom all roads lead to Rome.</p>

<p>When I have a cofounder or a team of three that works on a project
with me from begining to miserable failure, then I will concede that I
cannot build a startup. Until then, I will continue to laugh at those
who say I’m crazy or incapable. It’s hilarious to see the lengths to
which this handful of people will go and, at the same time, the rules
to which they seem to be willingly bound. They can doall that, but not
a single person can partner up with me? <em>LULZ</em></p>

<p>The other thing I find equally amusing is that certain happenings,
shall we say, seem to preclude me from ever reaching success or
renown. Really? David Conner can’t gain notoriety or influence?
Hmmm…. Rule #1: don’t present me with a challenge.</p>

<p>They also understand how important it is to acquire information, even
though directly asking the question would signal elements of their own
strategy to their opponents.  So they know how to work through other
people to acquire information, so that competitors aren’t tipped off
by the desire to obtain particular information.  That is, they
understand how to destructure and restructure the acquisition of
knowledge to satisfy appearances and other rules of the game.  They
also know how to destructure and restructure the steps of someone’s
plan of action or business strategy, as well as their own.  Or of
someone’s actions within their own organization.</p>

<p>They also understand that this kind of destructuring and restructuring
is very expensive, in terms of time and energy, but that it is
invaluable to security and risk mitigation.  They understand this and
are capable of acquiring the resources required to be capable of this
kind of orchestration.</p>

<h2 id="more-signaling">More Signaling</h2>

<p>Signaling is a subject on which I could expound ad infinitum. It’s
something that business analysts can easily miss.  To produce useful
or novel insight on signaling, it often requires intimate knowledge of
several years of closely watching a corporation or industry. That
these entities produce so much misinformation with advertising and
publicity only complicates analysis.  Fortunately, I spend tons of
time reading news and staying on top of current events.  It’s a shame
that I can’t get a job for lack of a degree.  That is also hilarious.</p>
