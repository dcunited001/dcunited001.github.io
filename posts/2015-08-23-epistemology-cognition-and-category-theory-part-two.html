<h2 id="a-high-level-overview-of-the-mind">A High Level Overview of the Mind</h2>

<p>Data and metadata about functions and language in particular is likely
found all over the brain.  And information related to other faculties
of the mind is likely similarly sharded all over the brain.  This
would help achieve dynamic behavior, as it would allow multiple
regions of the brain to sort of map functionality together.  But doing
so would also contribute to efficiency and redundancy.  That’s all
complete speculation on the brain.</p>

<p>Regardless of how it’s implemented in hardware, I do know that the
mind can dynamically coordinate it’s functionality.  I know I’m not
using 100% correct vocabulary for psychological and neurological terms
here.  Additionally, a lot of what I’m writing about is personal
speculation based on my own thoughts and experiences, combined with
concrete science where I can.  However, I’m not pulling these
conclusions from studies.  Yeh, I know, not scientific.  But,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPM-P7mNQw">I do what I want</a>.
That’s what I love about writing in my blog.  I don’t have to answer
to anyone in regard to my choice of content, proposition or how I’m
going to structure my argument.  90% of the work in crafting a
well-structured, well-justified argument is in identifying and
verifying respected sources.  That is exactly what I love not doing,
but I’m not exactly writing my thesis here.  IMO, existing scientific
methodologies aren’t yet capable of quickly iterating in these fields
– we’re improving by leaps and bounds, but there are many ideas we
just can’t prove.</p>

<p>However, I have spent a lot of time studying and meditating on
psychology, sociology and neurology.  I’ve taken Coursera classes on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>,
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/drugsandbrain">Neuropharmacology</a>,
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/neuromarketing">Neuro-Marketing</a>,
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/hiddenmessages">Bioinformatics I/II/III</a>
and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/neuromarketing">Epigenetics</a> to
name a few.  While I haven’t retained the most specific details as
well as I would like, these courses have been invaluable in
contributing to my ability to reason in these fields.</p>

<h3 id="sensory-data-and-immediate-preprocessing">Sensory Data and Immediate Preprocessing</h3>

<p>The brain receives data from its 5+ senses – yes, as things are
actually wired together in hardware there are more than 5 senses and
I’m not talking about psychic stuff here.  Balance is a good example
of a sense that is not usually considered as one.  I’ve found it
interesting to think of memory exposed to the mind as a kind of
temporal sense.</p>

<p>As it enters the brain, this sensory data is processed at a hardware
level to immediately provide some simple aggregate data to pass along
with the sensory data.  For example, passing along contrast maps for
each cone color would greatly simplify the process of visual object
recognition.  This data is passed along with the original data, so it
can be used as features in neural networks as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="phonological--visual-loop">Phonological &amp; Visual Loop</h3>

<p>Early on, sensory data is stored in the phonological and visual loop,
where your conscious and subconscious can quickly retrieve very
accurately replay sounds and images for a very short period of time.
This can be very useful if you have ADD =] but this memory fades very
fast, on the order of seconds.</p>

<h3 id="spatial-awareness">Spatial Awareness</h3>

<p>Sometimes referred to as Mind-Body Awareness.  This is the mind’s
awareness of how the body is positioned, in relation to its limbs,
other objects and other people.  Spatial awareness is built on top of
and interdependent with visual processing, tactile sensation, balance,
object recognition, object function and short-memory.  There are many
algorithmic shortcuts available to the brain when processing data to
construct both spatial awareness and faculties interdependent on
spatial awareness.  This is why it’s very useful to have all but the
most basic functions interdependent: it makes tasks for the brain
orders of magnitude more efficent.</p>

<h3 id="muscle-memory">Muscle Memory</h3>

<p>Muscle memory is very close to your hardware, probably mostly
contained within the cerebellum, exposed via the cerebral cortex and
orchestrated by various areas of the basal ganglia.  In Huntington’s,
one loses the ability to coordinate movements because of gradually
degrading networks in the basal ganglia.  This is probably the most
visible symptom of neural decay, in addition to a host of others that
affect your ability to funciton in life.  The cerebellum uniquely
contains Purkinje neurons, which are tree shaped and form probably
plays an extensive role in their functions.</p>

<p>Muscle memory is learned through repetition of particular movements.
It is interdependent with spatial awareness and other senses, vision
in particular.  The cerebellum is located close to the occipital
cortex, possibly necessitated by a functional relationship, though I’m
not sure that the networks overlap.  Object recognition could also be
interdependent because understanding how objects behave and can be
manipulated is crucial to executing routines specific to those
objects.  Sword fighting or skateboarding for example.</p>

<p>Muscle memory needs, at a very fundamental level, be capable of
dynamically altering execution of its learned routines based on
sensory feedback.  By “at a very fundamental level,” I mean that
muscle memory and coordination needs to dynamically respond to very
few interdependencies, so that it can do so very fast and very
efficiently.  Examples of this are “Spotting the Landing” in tricking
and skateboarding, which is a muscle memory response based on
visuospatial information which is functionally decoupled from the
muscle memory movement required for initiating a backflip or kickflip.</p>

<h3 id="short-term-memory">Short-Term Memory</h3>

<p>Short-term memory is usually associated with the hippocampus.  You
need it.  With a severe deficit in short-term memory, you will be
completely unable to function.  You may even get slapped with a
diagnosis of schizophrenia if it’s bad enough.  If you can’t retain
information that higher-order processes depend on, then you’re going
to have a hard time keeping it real and you won’t seem coherent to
other people.  However, schizophrenic symptoms resulting from a severe
deficit to short-term memory are significantly different from those
experienced in more traditional progressions of schizhophrenia, but
lead towards a very similar prognosis.</p>

<p>Short-term memory stores pieces of information for use by higher-order
mental processes.  Complex tasks like doing your taxes, actively
participating in conversation or emotionally reading people depend on
short-term memory, which tends to retain information on the order of
up to a minute.</p>

<p>Extensive short-term memory contributes greatly to a high IQ.  Many
tasks on IQ tests depend on the ability to quickly process large
amounts of information.  Anagrams are a great example.  If you want to
solve them quickly, you either need to be used to doing it or capable
of dynamically processing large amounts of lexical permutations, which
proficient short-term memory allows you to do.  There are many mental
processes associated with intelligence that do not require high
short-term memory and rather require introspection and
reflection. Additionally, there are various means of solving problems
that don’t require as much short-term memory.  Some of these are
actually more efficient algorithms.  Usually, you can solve the same
problem with less dependency on short-term memory if you have access
to a broader spectrum of information.  Ironically, if you have plenty
of short-term memory, you might not need to resort to identifying
these alternative methods.</p>

<h3 id="working-memory">Working Memory</h3>

<p>More closely associated with the frontal &amp; prefrontal cortex(PFC) than
short term memory.  It typically describes how processes in your PFC
will coordinate information in short-term memory towards the execution
of complex mental tasks.</p>

<p>Short-term and working memory contributes greatly towards being able
to methodically structure the information consciously stored in
long-term memory.  That is, poor short-term or working-memory can make
it very difficult to learn quickly.  Attention, focus, short-term and
working-memory are all interdependent.  And long-term memory, to a
lesser extent.  Interdependent because your focus determines what ends
up in your short-term memory and your working-memory can determine how
you shift your focus.  How you coordinate these processes determines
the information that ends up in your long term memory.</p>

<h3 id="long-term-memory">Long-Term Memory</h3>

<p>These are facts and sensory experiences, stored along with dimensional
information.  You have long term memory of words you’ve learned, which
is separate from the semantic meanings of those words.  There are many
neurological disorders that affect regions of the brain and, by
studying their progression and response to treatment, you can infer
how long-term memories are differentiated and stored.</p>

<p>Ideally, you should mindfully discern what information you choose to
store in long-term memory – all that we become is a result of what we
have thought.  If you stress too hard over trauma, you’ll strengthen
these memories and then you’ll be consumed by them.  Unlearning is
hard and the greater the extent to which you allow negativity to
direct your development, the harder it will become to change
direction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To avoid all evil, to cultivate good, and to cleanse one’s mind —
this is the teaching of the Buddhas.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many savants have unbelieveable proficiency in certain kinds of
long-term memory.  The Rainman could retrieve knowledge of almost any
fact his mind had considered, regardless of how conscious that
consideration was.  For some savants, particular sensory or cognitive
dimensions of information the mind processes seems to be stored in
complete, uncompressed form.  Some savants seem to have virtuoso-level
profiency for working with data of specific dimension and for
introspecting on the nature of processing that data.  Mozart, for
example, understood music completely as a child.  Something in his
mind enabled him to completely extrapolate all the processes that one
would need for working with music, basically just by looking at a
piano.  With as little input as possible from outside his mind.</p>

<p>Even if you consciously choose to forget something, it leaves an
inprint.  This is because there is subconscious aspect to long-term
memory, memory of things not consciously considered.  You have
long-term memory of images and sounds, of people that you’ve met, of
experiences you’ve had.  Even if you remove all the conscious links to
these memories, they still exist in your brain and can be triggered
years later.  The more powerful the impact on your subconscious at the
time, the more likely these images and memories could be retrieved
later, though they will be presented differently to your mind.</p>

<p>As you introspect your existing long-term memories, you create
aggregate memories based on them.  This is partially what is
responsible for the phenomenon where people’s description of a crime
or other intense event becomes more altered the more they think about
it.  As you create more memories based on other memories, you create a
particular worldview and outlook on life.  If you recover repressed
memories or find some of your beliefs to be false, then you have a
rift between these newfound beliefs and those aggregate memories and
explanations you created – as well as a rift in your overall outlook
on life, if those repressed memories were substantial in some way.</p>

<p>This is one reason repressed memories in and of themselves can cause
serious problems – you remember things both as you thought they were
and as you’ve discovered them to actually be.  You still have all
those possibly-inaccurate aggregate memories that affect how you
perceive the world and those memories are more strongly linked than
the newly discovered repressed memories.  As time goes on, you create
aggregate memories based on the repressed ones and the rift dissapates
over time.  This phenomenon could be incredibly confusing, quite
possibly enough to cause mental disorder if one is not firmly
grounded.  Additionally, your conscious mind can’t really access that
which you’ve repressed, leading to the occasional, vague sensation of
something that’s missing that you can’t define.</p>

<h3 id="procedures">Procedures</h3>

<p>Long-term memory of processes are created and strengthened as you use
them.  Procedures differ, yet overlap for various kinds of activities.
Your brain likely generalizes these procedures in a manner similar to
the description of generalizing social behavior in part one.  This is
so that what you learn from one activity can be applied to others as
well.</p>

<h3 id="focusattention">Focus/Attention</h3>

<p>Both are very similar and refer to how information is exposed to our
conscious mind, though our focus and attenion are definitely
conditioned over time to determine which information in the
subconscious is identified as relevent enough to bubble up to the
conscious.  Your conscious mind seems to be able to discern between
the information passed up, but also seems to be limited to what the
subconscious is capable of presenting to it.  That is, unless you are
prompted for some reason to become consciously aware of some
information.</p>

<h3 id="the-conscious-and-subconscious">The Conscious and Subconscious</h3>

<p>Over time, your conscious mind conditions the behavior of your
subconscious mind.  You might not be in control of your subconscious
mind, but you have some level of control over its development by
directing your focus.  Again, all that we become is a result of what
we have thought.  In order to extend your subconscious ability to
preprocess and present the conscious mind with useful possibilities,
you have to direct the kind of experiences you want to have.  The best
computer analogy I have for the subconscious is a GPU.  After being
conditioned to run specific procedures, the subconscious is able to
make these happen to a mind-blowing degree of efficiency.</p>

<p>People with Asperger’s seem to lack the subconscious ability to
preprocess information about social relationships and
interactions. IMO, it just seems like that information isn’t readily
available to my conscious mind because my subconscious doesn’t really
pay attention to it.  That was especially the case when I was young.
So I have to intellectually reason about it, which is markedly less
efficient.</p>

<h3 id="choreography-of-mental-faculties">Choreography of Mental Faculties</h3>

<p>The subconscious and conscious seem to be able to dynamically reuse
and coordinate various mental processes.  Some people seem to be much
better at learning to reuse information and processes than others.
Understanding category theory can greatly help us in improving the
ability to coordinate disparate functions of our brain.</p>

<h3 id="cognition">Cognition</h3>

<p>Cognition is our ability to abstract and reason about various
information, which happens at various levels, conscious and
subconscious.  However, when I think about cognition, I’m mostly
considering the thought processes when I am consciously directing,
which may be supported by subconscious processes as well.  Cognition
and abstract reasoning greatly contribute to our intelligence and
differentiate humans from most animal species on the planet.  It’s our
ability to generalize and process disparate types of information.</p>

<h3 id="metacognition">Metacognition</h3>

<p>Metacognition is by far one of the most important attributes for
intelligence, moreso than short-term memory IMO.  Metacognition is
cognition about cognition.  People with strong metacognition are able
to abstract and reason about their own thought process, which can lead
to mind blowing insights.</p>

<h2 id="part-three-directive-cognitive-expansionposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtml">Part Three: <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html">Directive Cognitive Expansion</a></h2>

<p>I’ll cover how you can improve specific cognitive faculties by
learning new things.  I’ll also discuss the importants of assessing a
new activity for its particular benifits.  Finally, I’ll offer
examples of what parts of the mind is utilized for several activities
such as chess, music, acting, programming, dancing and skateboarding.</p>
