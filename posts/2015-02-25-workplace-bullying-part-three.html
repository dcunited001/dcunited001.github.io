<p>I hope to share what has happened to me and around me, so that other’s
can identify it and protect themselves from negative behavior.  I need
to vent a little bit because rumination is unhealthy.  I hope to get
this off my chest and <em>never need to think about it again.</em> I’m
serious.  The situations I’ve gone through are downright poisonous. I
am still suffering.</p>

<p>Some “tactics” I describe didn’t happen to me personally.  Some of
these are situations that I’ve experienced, but some of them I’ve seen
friends go through.  Half of what I’m talking about didn’t occur to me
in the workplace.  It happened in Jamskating, where things were
incredibly competitive, as that’s the nature of the entertainment
industry.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to bring retaliation against a former colleague or
business.  If there are identifying details in here, I’m sorry.
That’s not my intention.  Any details I provide I will attempt to keep
vague.  However, because it is vague, I’m at risk of seeming
passive-aggressive myself – or worse, possibly making someone who is
not at fault feel responsible for something that happened.  If you
find yourself wondering whether you were involved in an example in one
of the following sections, that means you probably weren’t.</p>

<p>Also, this is my experience from my perspective.  One of the worst
aspects of passive aggressive behavior – and one reason that it is so
effective – is that positive behavior becomes easy to confuse with
negative behavior, since the goal is to confuse cause and effect, to
encourage inaction and to prevent interference.</p>

<p>The bully may utilize suggestion and rhetoric to make “copies” of
himself and his beliefs.  They may bring in new people and poison them
against you.</p>

<p>This is really an advanced tactic, only possible once someone has
plenty of control in an environment.  Additionally, the environment
needs to be large enough to support this.  You’re not going to see
this happen in a small or medium size business.  If someone has the
power required to attain this, you’ve already lost.  There’s basically
nothing you can do.  In order to fight it, you’re going to need untold
training in metaphysical jujitsu.</p>

<p><a name="spread-rumors"></a></p>

<h1 id="x265e-spread-rumorsspread-rumors-1">♞ <a href="#spread-rumors">Spread Rumors</a></h1>

<p>The bully may acquire information about you in order to spread
believeable rumors.  You may spend years fighting these rumors.  You
may not even know that people believe these things about you – in
fact, you probably won’t.  The bullies will spend considerable effort
crafting rumors in such a way that no one will verify the truth.</p>

<p>They will work through catspaws to spread these rumors and you will
not know who started them, if you ever hear about them.  Sometimes, a
bully will pick out the worst possible things, a rumor so nasty that
no one will verify it for themselves.</p>

<p><a name="abuse-confirmation-bias"></a></p>

<h1 id="x265e-abuse-confirmation-bias-when-speading-rumorsabuse-confirmation-bias-1">♞ <a href="#abuse-confirmation-bias">Abuse Confirmation Bias when Speading Rumors</a></h1>

<p>When the bully spreads a rumor, they may couple this by suggesting a
method to test you with.  “Oh.. just ask him this or mention that.
See how he responds and you’ll see its true.”  By doing this and
constructing the rumors in just the right way, people will form
concrete beliefs about you that are not true.  And once enough people
form these beliefs, they are nearly impossible to shake.  These ideas
will acquire an <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore">egregore</a></em>, a
will of their own.  Most people won’t ask you things directly, so it
becomes difficult to dispel them.</p>

<p>By coming up with clever ways of abusing confirmation bias, it
increases the likelihood that these rumors will stick.  It’s magical
– people will test these rumors and then feel confident they just
outed you on something, when you really have no idea what’s going on.
Or eventually, you wonder way sooo many people that you just met keep
asking about X, Y, or Z, which are not topics which normally come up
in conversation!  But it’s like always the third topic someone pursues
in their first conversation with you.  At this point, your anxiety
becomes the confirmation bias – your anxiety and nervousness about
the subject confirms it in this persons mind!  …. $#@!’ed up, ain’t
it?</p>

<p>Watches porn? Make sure everyone thinks they’re a “creeper” whatever
that means.  Whats the wierdest fetish you can think of? They’re into
it.  Paint sex as the primary motivation behind this person’s
interactions with people.  Again, no one will actually verify it – no
one will even get close to this person.  This is how lives are ruined,
folks.</p>

<p>This is another particularly useful tool in creating rumors and
suggesting methods of confirmation bias.  This involves <strong>Category
Theory</strong>, by the way.  Beware people who are especially proficient at
this.  If it concerns a lie that’s in the form of rearranged truth,
then people will try to verify pieces of the truth that compose the
lie.  When they verify enough pieces of truth, they will assume that
it is true in its entireity.</p>

<p>This technique is similar to the method used by some rock artists to
write songs.  They basically pick lyrics, words and concepts that
resonate with people then chop them up and rearrange them. People will
spend decades trying to decide what they mean, when they never really
meant anything at all, in and of themselves anyways.  The songs and
lyrics will begin to acquire meaning though.  Incredibly useful tool
for artists.</p>

<h1 id="x265e-pick-a-weak-targetpick-a-weak-target-1">♞ <a href="#pick-a-weak-target">Pick a Weak Target</a></h1>

<p>A bully doesn’t want to pick a fight they’re going to lose do they?</p>

<p>The bully will find someone who is socially isolated to begin with.
And the bully will attack that person by attacking their strong social
connections in that environment.  By doing this, the people who would
stand up for that person no longer will.  This is especially effective
if that person has a developmental disorder making it hard for them to
establish relationships in the first place!!</p>

<h1 id="x265e-blocking-moves-like-those-in-chessblocking-moves-1">♞ <a href="#blocking-moves">Blocking Moves, Like Those in Chess</a></h1>

<p>The bully may attempt to prevent you from acquiring new relationships
by blocking you.  This can be physical, like blocking you from
entering a conversation by forming a tighter circle or turning their
back.</p>

<p>They can also identify the people you are trying to acquaint yourself
with to try to preemptively establish a stronger relationship with
them.  Then, a manipulative person is capable of poisoning them
against you before you have a chance.</p>

<p><a name="attach-labels"></a></p>

<h1 id="x265e-attach-labels-to-youattach-labels-1">♞ <a href="#attach-labels">Attach Labels to You</a></h1>

<p>Already discussed this at length, but this bully will try to attach
labels to you.  They may feel out their social environment to
determine which labels are the most effective to apply to you.</p>

<p><a name="disarm-you-with-kindness"></a></p>

<h1 id="x265e-disarm-you-with-kindnessdisarm-you-with-kindness-1">♞ <a href="#disarm-you-with-kindness">Disarm You with Kindness</a></h1>

<p>Awww, isn’t that sweet.  They’re being nice to you.  How can you even
be mad at them!  This is a particularly effective tool in the bully’s
arsenal:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming">reversal of blame to the victim</a>.
It also happens to be something good people try to do in order to
reconcile differences.  Ahhh, plausible deniability.  There it is

<p>Playing dumb is particularly effective.  And I’ve been burned badly

<p>Of course, there are different kinds of “playing dumb.”  There is the
person who plays dumb from the get-go in order to lull you into a
sense of security from which they can take advantage of you.  Carnies
do this and some street kids do this.  Homeless people also do this
.. homeless people aren’t actually that dumb.  Regardless, if you fall
for this, you may find yourself quickly in a sticky situation.  It’s
best to just look past it when you notice it.</p>

<p>There’s another kind of playing dumb, which is more of a brief
response to other behavior.  Sometimes it’s better off to not
broadcast everything you know, especially to those who are trying to
take advantage of you.</p>

<p>This is a particularly effective form of bad advice.  Everyone has a
social model, but the problem is that some of these social models just
plain suck.  If you don’t have a great social model and you know you
need to improve, you may seek out help in the friends around you.
Turns out, some of these “friends” aren’t friends at all.  <em>WATCH
OUT!</em> If they determine what you use to functionally optimize your
behavior, they can offer you advice that deeply changes how you
interact with people.</p>

<p>Some people are particularly effective at this – somehow; I don’t get
it – beware these people.  If someone offers you advice that <strong>(1)
you know to be false</strong> and <strong>(2) you know they should know to be
false</strong>, then you’re allowed to play dumb here.  This is not a good
person – in fact, this is a very bad person.  Play dumb and discover
what else they’d like you to know =]</p>

<p>Be careful though.  Most people aren’t manipulative.  You may be
making a mistake in misjudging this person.  Always keep that in mind,
as well.  But also watch for people who seem to try to make you

<p>Though I didn’t understand at the time, now I do.  Setting the frame
of something – a piece of art or a person’s reputation &amp; statements
– limits the possibilities!  This is the subject of another post that
I’m going to write.</p>

<p>I hate this.  I fucking hate this.  I’m not the most articulate,
eloquent speaker.  And sometimes, the things I say can be
misinterpreted.  However, <strong>each workplace bully</strong> that I’ve worked
with has <strong>sought to misinterpret what I’ve said in group settings.</strong>
*Manipulative people are very, very good at discovering double
meanings – <strong>they have to be, to discover situations where plausible
deniability can be applied!!</strong> *</p>

<p>In some cases, I would try to explain something: an idea, a
well-meaning critique on something.  In nearly every case, it was
something that should have been interpreted properly, but may have
needed more explaining.  The workplace bully would discover ways he
could intentionally misinterpret what I had to say and then twist it
around.  What usually results is that everyone else becomes confused
– did he really mean <em>that</em>?  After this happens like 15 times, can
you really say it’s a coincidence?!?</p>

<p>In my case, as I’m a fairly quiet person, I would have to stand up for
myself and correct this person.  But you’re lucky if someone sets the
frame of conversation around you.  They may set the frame before
you’re introduced to the conversation.  The frame of conversation is
difficult to describe, but it basically describes everyone’s shared
context behind a conversation.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">Pavlog’s Dog</a> is
an old experiment, where the dogs were conditioned to expect food at

became so strong, it caused the dogs to salivate without the presence
of food.</p>

<p>My point is: in each instance, a workplace bully has <em>almost seemed
trained in psychology!</em> And they abused it, which is really, really
fucked up! One or two of these people knew it because they either
directly mentioned it or they had studied psychology in college. And
you don’t study psychology in college without running into Pavlov’s
dog. It’s a bit sick to imagine someone thinking like this
though. Also, if you’re completely unaware of psychology, you’ll be
caught off guard when it’s used against you.</p>

<p>Pavlov’s dog is useful to someone who wants to create signals used to

<p>This is another one related to psychology.  I’ve noticed that these
people will do something I call “rorshocking.” That’s intentionally
misspelled by the way.  This means that they show you something or
make a statement, in an attempt to make a judgement from your
reaction.  Lots of people do this, by the way – sometimes it really
is a good way to elicit someone’s beliefs.  However, in my case, a lot
of people have made grievous misjudgements based on my reactions.
Usually, you’ll find people do this when they don’t want to overtly
ask you something.</p>

misconstrue your reaction in an attempt to whittle away at your

in his car and halfway there.</p>

  <p>“….. . .  yeh… . . ???” - I reply, feigning agreement, unsure of
what to say in such an awkward situation. I would never want to do
something like that, of course.</p>

  <p>Later, at the hotel, while I’m not around:</p>

  <p>“Yeh and on the ride over to the hotel, he said he wanted to run a
train on her.” - My ‘friend’ misquoting an awkward statement where I
never used those words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Classy, right?  Gotta love jamskaters.</p>

<p>Of course, this is one scenario that no one will ever actually ask you
directly to verify.  <em>No one’s going to want to ask anyone about
that.</em> In this particular example, I’m unsure whether I was actually
misquoted here.  But why did my ‘friend’ who I had known for ten
years, ask me this in the first place?  Shouldn’t a friend know me
well enough to not ask me that?  Or could it be that he wanted to
neutralize me because he wanted the girl?</p>

<p>However, I can say with certainty that I have been misquoted behind my
back in other situations.  This includes a few situations that
happened at work, where if someone didn’t ask to verify with me, they
would have been left with a completely invalid impression.  If your
“friends” create situations where they coerce you to make statements
like this, just to misquote you around your back, can you really say
that they’re your friends?  Like if you’re going to misquote someone
like that, <strong>JUST FUCKING LIE</strong>.  Just make some shit up.  Pull it out

<p>The bully may try to apply psychological labels to you.  This can be
particularly effective, as oftentimes with mental disorders, the way
people react to the label can be more devastating than the disease
itself.  For example, if someone repeatedly calls you paranoid, people
around you may mistake this for paranoid schizophrenic.  Or they may
not label you with anything specific: they might just insinuate that
you’re crazy in one way or another.  But if you’re labelled as
paranoid, you’re probably not going to be taken seriously anytime
soon.  Sometimes, people just throw labels out there to see what
sticks.  It’s incredibly unsettling.</p>

<p>To me, these people seemed trained in psychology. So it’s no surprise
that they would recognize the symptoms. And yes, this happened to me
before, several times. I heard the guy who has the psychology degree
(who wasn’t a very good programmer) mention specific psychological and
neurological symptoms/signs in an offhand conversation to someone
else. And the nature of the conversation was such that he was trying
to indicate to that person that they were going to have a hard time

<p>Because intentions are concealed and sociopaths thrive on plausible
deniability &amp; duplicity – then, when dealing with passive aggressive
behavior, one can easily become paranoid.  And that’s often one goal:
make your opponent seem paranoid.  And once others concur, well then,
now you have carte blanche to do pretty much anything – and your
opponent is never able to publicly second-guess your motivations.  If
they do, you can easily bust out the “paranoid” card.</p>

<p>By the way, <strong>interpreting motivations behind behavior</strong> and
<strong>determining correlated reactions &amp; behaviors</strong> are two of the most
powerful things you can do in life. This is an example of having your
social model distorted. If you are not allowed to do these things, you
will never succeed in any significant way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You Must Determine Correlated Behavior!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do I mean by that?  You need to not only identify when someone’s
behavior is functionally coupled to your own, but how their behavior
and reactions are related to your own.  There are many ways of doing
this, but you can only learn to do this from experience.  You have to
experiment and test to see how someone reacts to you, but beware of
confirmation bias.</p>

<p>Any “test” you give them can be manipulated.  Or worse, you could
misconstrue the results.  The best way to “test” someone is not to
test them at all – let life itself show you their true intentions.
When something crazy happens, where you and this person have chips in
the game, only then you’ll see their true colors.</p>

<p>The CIA has the D.E.C. method – Determine, Evade, Coerce. At least,
they do according to the TV show, Covert Affairs.  Pretty awesome TV
show though.</p>

#### Agent Annie Walker on Covert Affairs.  I’d put a ring on it LOL</p>

<p>Of course, your approach to discovering someone’s motivations needs to
be balanced.  If you drive yourself to paranoia, then you will
prematurely end positive opportunities out of fear, which will drive
you to isolation.</p>

<p>Not everyone has sinister motivations – in fact, most people are
truly good at heart.  They’re innocent and they want to help those
around them.  This makes them useful to sociopathic people.  One
problem is that they can be poisoned against you, before you ever get
the chance to meet them.  They will act with behavior suggested to
them by your enemies.</p>

minutes to put together a defense for myself between the time that my
roommate in Raleigh notified me of the situation – via text message
– and the time that he arrived at home.  Very very fucked up, IMO.</p>

<blockquote>

at 8:30am, five minutes before they return…  If they discovered it
before they left for class, then wouldn’t they have mentioned it
before they left for class?”</p>

<p>I’m not sure who did it and I hope it was not some conspired event.
All I know is that I literally woke up in a scary legally airtight
situation of which I had NO KNOWLEDGE – the only people in my
apartment during that time were me and my roommate….  As my roommate
came home, I thought ahead and had an audio recording app ready and my
first words were “this conversation is being recorded.”  I was
immediately accused of having stolen the PS4 – with $2000 in the bank
at the time.  I believed that anyone who would steal a PS4 would not
want the situation public, so I immediately posted the audio recording
on Youtube &amp; Facebook, publicly.  A really shitty legal defense, by
the way.  If a lawyer ever tells you do do something like this, fire
that lawyer.  And demand your retainer returned.</p>

  <p>“Build me a goddamn bridge, David.  But, don’t use a goddamn hammer
or any fucking nails, David.  Or so help me God, I’ll fire your lazy
ass.  You’re going to build me that goddamn bridge and you’re going
to use rope! Dammit David, do exactly what I tell you.  Your goddamn
bridge fell apart.  What the fuck did I tell you about rope?”</p>

  <p>“But … I spent 200 hours on that rope bridge.  I took me twenty
times as long because I couldn’t use a hammer.”</p>

  <p>“Shut up, David.  SEE EVERYONE, watch what happens when you build
shitty rope bridges.  YOUR FIRED!”</p>

<p>If someone is going to bully you and if they are good at it, they WILL
profile you.  They will ask you leading questions.  And they WILL ask
you about your age.  You can count on that.  Your age (if you are
young) reveals which pop culture references you do and do not know,
what technologies you know, etc, etc.  Sounds subtle, but trust me,
it’s useful.</p>

<h1 id="x265e-install-malware-on-your-computerinstall-malware-1">♞ <a href="#install-malware">Install Malware on Your Computer</a></h1>

<p>A workplace bully is going to want to keep an eye on you.  There are
many examples of voice-to-text exploits online.  Another
software-specific example of shitty shit that shitty developers do,
but be aware of your words and actions around that laptop they gave
you.  It’s impossible to say for sure, but there’s a chance that
there’s malware on it.</p>

<p>By listening in to your conversations, a workplace bully can identify
scenario’s they are likely to get away with and they can gain
invaluable understanding behind your own actions as well.</p>

<p>This almost implies that someone has other people networked in on
this, by the way. Installing malware is the kind of move where it’s
going to leave a trace. They could get caught. If they got caught,
that’d be a big fucking deal. But guess what! It’s not them. It’s
someone else that you don’t know that does this. Then they’re not at
risk to take the fault, even though they are receiving information and
advice about how to handle you from someone else.</p>

<h3 id="the-smoking-gun">The Smoking Gun</h3>

<p>THIS IS THE DEAD GIVEAWAY THAT SOMEONE FUCKED WITH MY LIFE, BY THE
WAY! No, not that someone installed malware, but that there were
people who could not possibly coordinating their actions was perfectly
incidentally as they were and as part of a coordinated strategy with
regard to my psychology and sociology!!! That’s what makes me so
goddamn angry about all this. KNOWING that someone fucked with my life
for the better part of a decade and RUINED it. And knowing that no one
will ever display the accountability for this. NEVER! What the fuck is
that?</p>

<p>How the fuck am I supposed to move on after CAREER ASSASSINATION?!
When no one will ever say “Yeh, something along those lines
happened. You should probably give him a fucking break.”</p>

<p>GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE WITH THAT SHIT. And you want to know what
pisses me off?</p>

<p>And NO, this was not just <strong>random behavior</strong> from malicious
people. That on it’s own is bad enough. But you know how I can tell?
Look for the equilibrium these people seek. That’s the subject of an
article I’ll write soon. But these people, the handful I’ve had a
problem with, it’s their objective to seek to push me out. It’s like
linear regression, for human behavior. They are completely fine when
things are getting worse, for me. Usually, if you have problems with
someone, you can sort that shit out. But not if they really, really
are out to get you. Then they are going to get you. And they are not
going to tell you and they are going to throw everything they have at
you AND THEY ARE FUCKING GOOD AT IT.</p>

<h3 id="america-what-the-fuck">America? WHAT THE FUCK!!</h3>

<p>And I think I have perfectly displayed just how intelligent I am. If
someone had worked with me in a positive way – or rather, if someone
had not outright sabotaged my life and destroyed my family
relationships, yada yada, then I would have been completely fine. I
would have excelled actually. I would have been so much further than I
am now.</p>

<p>So yeh. Go ahead and say “we wanted the best for you.” That shit right
there? That’s laughable. Because if I was laying in a gutter right
now, these assholes would sleep sound at night knowing their job had
been done. Their objective to discredit me and destroy my life had
been completed. They never, ever wanted what was best for me. They
wanted me to get the fuck out of the way. That’s all.</p>

<p>And what if I hadn’t been so intelligent? What if I couldn’t recognize
what was going on. That something was wrong. They threw their entire
weight against someone who has asberger’s and neurological
problems. And someone whom they specificly isolated to solitude. AND I
FUCKING HANDED THEIR ASSES TO THEM. And you know what? They’re
mad. They’re mad that they didn’t win. They’re fucking sore
losers. And they got their asses handed to them by an “autist.”</p>

<p>My favorite part though is watching these people squirm between a
system of ethics that restricts them, though they <em>clearly</em> have no
ethical restraints themselves. Or at least, that’s true of the people
doing the dirty work. It’s hilarious how they artificially restrain
themselves? Why stop there? Why not just go all out stazi? What’s
stopping them?</p>

<p>I split out this part from Part Two since it was getting too long.
I’m in the process of writing Part Four, the section containing tools
you can use to prevent this behavior from occuring in front of you.
This is definitely the most important part.  I wanted to include it
first, but it requires a lot of context to understand why this is
important.</p>
