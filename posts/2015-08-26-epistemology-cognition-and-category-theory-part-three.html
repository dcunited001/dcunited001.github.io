<p>Learning new activities, like chess, language or acting, can help us
strengthen specific faculties of our mind, conscious and subconscious.
This is particularly effective during childhood, but neuroplasticity
enables to continually update our hardware and software throughout
life.  There’s a huge focus on STEM and this is appropriate, but the
arts offer immense benefits to further accelerate development and
self-actualization.  We can’t forget that what we seem to do just for
fun has a great benefit in how we’ll perform at work.  Additionally,
the arts can help us understand what kinds of tasks our mind would be
most profient at pursuing.  I’ll discuss the following arts and
activities:</p>

<p>For the third time, all that we become is a result of what we have
thought.  So by pursuing these activities, we’re controlling the kinds
of experiences that we have and choosing the benefits we’ll derive
from life, while equipping ourselves with more tools.  And therefore,
we’re determining our own course of mental development.  In order to
pursue the ideal direction, we need to understand more about the
mental faculties that various activities both require and develop.
These activities require a certain level of profiency in mental
skills, but also improve profiency at different rates.  We also need
to assess our own mind, to become aware of what would be valuable to
develop further.</p>

<p>As you focus on self-improvement in these activities, you’ll be
reinforcing the circuits in your mind that enable certain functional
capabilities.  If you want better short-term memory, focus on
practicing activities that require short-term memory.  If you want
quicker reflexivity, focus on activities that require quick reflexes.
If you want to be more spontaneous, practice activities that require
and develop spontanaeity.  If the process to discovering new cognitive
techniques can be consciously observed and improved on, then we can
expand the conscious mind to develop and coordinate the subconscious.
Approaching cognition and metacognition from this perspective allows
us to greatly accelerate our rate of learning by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Many psychological and neurological disorders see promising treatment
by focusing patients on certain activities and thought patterns, which
are thought to gradually improve the state of their mind.  Therefore,
the arts can be used as treatments and I explored this idea in my
article
<a href="http://te.xel.io/posts/2015-01-28-language-therapy-for-asd-and-tbi.html">Language Therapy For Autism and Traumatic Brain Injury</a>.
Part three of this series on cognition is a kind of generalization of
that article.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy applies ideas like this to
present a patient with situations compelling them to think and react
differently, to force development of new skills and thought patterns.
However, the pursuit of these activites typically requires the patient
to focus on activities they don’t inherently excel at. And so, we need
to approach this in such a way as to avoid needless frustration for
someone.</p>

<p>However, it is a virtue to enjoy the pursuit of that which is
challenging.  People who don’t embody this often find themselves at a
disadvantage.  Gotta break free of your comfort zone.  Everyone should
read Aristotle’s
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/">Ethics</a> to
understand what these various virtues are and how to balance yourself
in the mean.  Yes, philosophy is useful … perhaps too useful…</p>

<h2 id="modeling-cognitive-traits-for-activities">Modeling Cognitive Traits for Activities</h2>

<p>Some of these examples of arts and activities refer to specific base
cognitive capabilities, like short-term memory or empathy.  Others
refer to more aggregate activities, which strengthen the coordination
of those base cognitive functions in a specialized way.</p>

<p><a name="programming"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-programmingposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmlprogramming-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#programming">Programming</a></h3>

<p>I’m going to start out with programming because it is perhaps one of
the most beneficial, in terms of expanding your cognition.  It’s also
one of the few that require development of metacognition.  First off,
programming is rarely useful in and of itself.  That is, whether you
are developing a web app, mining data to construct statistical models
or coding audio visualization, you are almost always working with
programming <em>and</em> another field.  In order to solve programming
problems in that field, you have to exhibit proficiency in modeling
problems for that domain.</p>

<p>Programming strenthens our ability to deconstruct and generalize
large, complicated problems into smaller problems.  Therefore, it
embodies our ability to abstract processes into logical step-by-step
procedures.  Programming actually involves very high-level mathematic
concepts, though seeing it from this perspective is hidden to most,
which is fantastic – you learn the basics of implementations of these
high-level concepts without having to take master’s level math
classes.  The cognitive functions that programming improves are
cognition itself and metacognition.  Anyone who learns to program
fairly proficiently will become more intelligent, the earlier the
better.</p>

<p><a name="chess"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-chessposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmlchess-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#chess">Chess</a></h3>

<p>To think more than three or four moves ahead in chess requires
extensive short-term memory.  In order to excel at chess, you need to
retain experience of previous games, in order to infer strategic
similiarities between situations, which is the only way to really
compress the space of all board positions.  You need to understand how
to read your opponents moves to understand how they’ll react to yours.</p>

<p>You also need to be able to identify the strategic board positions you
want to reach in 5+ moves and deconstruct your move sequences into
those that prevent interference or won’t alarm your opponent.  In
order to do so, you need to strenthen your cognitive ability to
perform
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_induction">backward induction</a>.
In chess, endgame is a backward induction problem, where you try to
identify possible checkmate scenarios and the move sequences that
allow you to reach them.  Backward induction is employed throughout a
chess game.</p>

<p><a name="painting"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-paintingposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmlpainting-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#painting">Painting</a></h3>

<p>There’s a good reason that many polymaths were painters. We live in a
very visual world.  Painting and visual art in general require us to
develop this kind of inner vision, which is crucial to design and
expression.  Painters need to understand how to convey a universally
understood message without using words.</p>

<p>Renaissance painters were masters of constructing situations utilizing
body language and suspended animation to convey a message that could
be understood by even those who couldn’t read.  Abstract art acheives
this in a different way and because of its diverse construction, it
can be harder to identify the meaning.  However, this actually
contributes to its propensity to be more expansive as art: by lacking
a more certain meaning, abstract appeals to more people, as it allows
us to search within ourselves for its specific meaning to us.</p>

<p>The most successful paintings are those which inspire us to meditate
deeply on their meaning and are coupled with a universal, timeless
message. So, as an artist, it’s important to cultivate that
understanding of what is universal and what won’t fade with time.  So
not only do you need to develop the technique, but you also have to
look inwards and familiarize yourself with the world around you,
beyond just seeing what is there now.  It’s very difficult to think
timelessly and our thoughts today are so innundated with sensory
distraction.  I feel there is much people that understood more
innately 200, 1000 and 3000 years ago that today seems profound to us,
simply because what we are required to know and how we are require to
think does not facilitate introspection or spiritual awakening.</p>

<p>In addition to the development of a vision, painting requires
comprehending the composition of various techniques to acheive that
vision.  Da Vinci and Rembrandt were masters of this process of
determining process.  You have to not only understand what you want to
paint, but exactly how you are going to paint it.  This requires much
short-term memory.  The more experience you have, the more capable you
are of extrapolating the process you will use to create it.
Additionally, these techniques can be very time-dependent for
painting.</p>

<p><a name="music"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-musicposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmlmusic-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#music">Music</a></h3>

<p>Music is another great cognition expanding activity, but it’s
important to start early, study theory and play many instruments,
especially piano.  Music theory allows you to understand how many
complicated patterns interrelate, in order to identify similarities in
information.</p>

<p>Music composition employs music theory and requires that you develop
this aural inner vision: the ability to ideate the kind of sounds you
want to create.  It’s similar to a painter’s inner vision I discussed
above.  This kind of inner vision is also similar to the endgame
strategy and backward induction, though you don’t have to account for
an opponent’s reaction.  You brainstorm where you want to be and find
a way to get there.  Both painting and music composition allow you to
strengthen this ideation and provide you with the tools to realize
your vision.  Backwards induction is a critical skill to develop in
life and one that can be generalized by our mind.</p>

<p>Performing music requires strengthening your self-perception.  If
you’re playing for an audience, you need to understand how you sound
to the audience and how your expression of sound will affect their
interpretation.  When playing in a group, it’s even more important
because your volume level needs to match that of the band.  Some
members of a band, like drums and bass never seem to stand out, but
provide a foundation for the rest of the music.  The other members
would completely fall apart if the drummer lost rhythm.  So performing
music with a group also allows us to introspect on the importance of
fulfilling specialized roles as part of a group.  Additionally,
performing improvisationally as part of a group requires deep
understanding of the group’s intention of musical direction, as well
each member’s playing abilities.</p>

<p>Drumset is unique among instruments for its ability to improve
rhythmic coordination.  Learning drumset forces you to dissociate from
conscious control over each limb as the rhythms you play become
further disconnected.  A good excercise is to learn to play triplet
patterns while playing sixteenth note patterns with another limb, a la
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantaisie-Impromptu">Fantasie Impromptu</a>,
though this is pretty simple.  You have to learn to focus on playing
complicated rhythms distributed to each limb.  This is similar to
isolations in poplock and hiphop dance styles and your mind should be
able to carry over some of the skills used for drumsets to dancing as
well.  This is because the mind should generalize the skill of
coordinating these dissociated movements to apply what you’ve learned

<p>Writers have to understand how to portray various situations in order
to cultivate the reader’s thoughts towards specific avenues. Writers
need to intensely understand psychology, not just of the situations
they present in their works, but also of the various categories of
readers, who will interpret the work differently. The best writers can
do this in such a way that allows readers to explore hidden ideas that
inspired a work.</p>

<p>In addition to cultivating specific thought in a reader, writers also
need to captivate the reader’s attention.  This requires structuring
plot and events with a strategic pace and understanding what motivates
people to continue reading. Writers need to understand what makes
events and dialog seem “natural” or at least coherent with the story
or characters. Being a good writer means you have the emotional
intelligence and empathy to understand psychology and the human
condition.  You’ll find that a good writer is a people watcher,
constantly observing their interactions and often perceiving them more
clearly than the people themselves.  You must also develop expressive
language and writing skills.</p>

<p>MC’ing and especially freestyle rapping requires intimate knowledge of
language, rhythm and expression.  The best MC’s can can layer their
phonetic skills with the spontaneous ideation of a coherent message.
Often you’ll find MC’s who freestyle and have somewhat proficient
rhythm and rhyme, but aren’t really conveying a message.  This doesn’t
take nearly as much skill as the whole package.</p>

<p>Breakdancing requires the development of the physical skills balance,
flexibility and strength. Not only does more strength enable new
moves, but the more strenth you have, the less proportionate energy
you invest in those moves.  Therefore, more strength, more endurance.
How does this relate to the mind?  In order to develop physical
balance, flexibility and strength, you need to identify ways to
develop all three, without excluding flexibility.</p>

<p>Also, breakdancing requires the development of a particular spatial
awareness of the self.  You need to be aware of all the possibilities
for movement from any position to any possible position.  You develop
this kind of graph, which represents your awareness of which moves
allow transitions to all other moves.  You cultivate creativity to
determine which transitions &amp; moves are possible, as well as how they
can be generalized and variated.  Additionally, certain song rhythms
and tempo’s facilitate patterns of movements.</p>

<p>Some bboy’s focus on the power moves, like mills, flares and
airflares.  Others focus on style, which is the use of movements to
express a message.  In other words, you cultivate your own personal
language through dance, which transcends cultural boundaries just like
visual art.  In order to best express yourself through dance, you’ll
need to develop counting beats and phrases, until you do it
subconsciously.  If you’re not counting beats and phrases, you’re not
a dancer.</p>

<p>Tricking requires extremely quick reflexes and a different kind of
spatial awareness of the self. Whereas breakdancing requires awareness
of the body in relation to itself towards the expression of your own
personal language, tricking and parkour require a kind of spatial
awareness of your self in relation to your environment and motion.
You need to be able to subconsciously feel exactly where you are, with
and without utilizing vision.  Similarly to bboying, you need to
understand and feel which moves you can transition to next.</p>

<p>An experienced parkour runner sees the world differently.  Every
physical scenario is an opportunity for challenge and self-expression.
I’ll discuss tricking and parkour further in part five, in order to
demonstrate how category theory can be used to help model something
not usually considered mathematic.</p>

<p>Yoga develops mind-body awareness, which is very important for spatial awareness.  As you practice poses, you better understand how to balance in different planes at various joints.  In contrast to spatial awareness, you develop the subconscious understanding of which muscles contribute to balance under various circumstances, which is part of mind-body awareness.  Yoga can also facilitate the exploration of meditative states of consciousness and helps develop healthy full breathing patterns.  We all breath, but not everyone oxygenates as well as they could.</p>

<p>This is the combination of a wide variety of skills that require high
emotional intelligence and accurate self-perception.  Even for those
of us who don’t plan on being an actor, acting can facilitate the
development of this emotional intelligence by requiring us to assume
roles where we have to empathize with our character, as well as other
actors.  Acting requires expressiveness, self-understanding and the
ability to see things from more than one viewpoint, both visually and
emotionally.  It requires the development of acute spatial awareness,
accurate visual/aural self-perception and empathy with fellow actors
and your audience.  To be a successful actor, you need to understand
how to compartmentalize as your character, without having your own
personality, mental processes and expressions bleed through.</p>

<p>Actors need to be aware of how people will interpret various
expressions, as well as how other actors will respond to them.  You’ll
need to cooperate with these actors in the creation of an experience
conveying some definite meaning that contributes to development in the
overall work.  But you’ll need to do so without detracting from some
possibly unknown and/or indefinite meaning.</p>

<p>Similar to how painters develop inner vision to ideate paintings,
actors develop an inner vision to ideate scenarios with other people,
which seems very complicated to me.  Development of various kinds of
inner vision is dependent on adept coordination of cognitive
faculties.  You’ll notice that painters will exhibit great visual
memory &amp; ideation.  Similarly, actors will exhibit great situational
memory and ideation of possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Proficiently trained neural networks can interpret &amp; classify
content, but they can also be inverted to produce content.</strong> This
concept is clearly demonstrated in the arts ability to develop a
particular kind of creative vision.</p>

<p><a name="improv"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-improvposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmlimprov-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#improv">Improv</a></h3>

<p>Like acting, improv requires this awareness of how situations will be
perceived as entertaining by the audience.  However, you have to be
more familiar with the possibilities, so that you can work with the
other actors to create the most entertaining experiences for your
audience, while maintaining the novelty.  Improv requires empathizing
with your performers in order to understand how they’ll react to
various situations.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there are some overlaps with math and category theory:
you want to create situations the maximize both the entertainment
value and the number of possible transitions to other situations.
This is kind of the basis of “Yes And,” which is a trick that improv
actors use to prevent a dead end and allow another actor to pursue the
ideation of his own scenario.  Don’t know what to say?  Yes And.  Need
more information about the direction your partner wants to take?  Yes
And.</p>

<p>Improv actors would need to be familiar with all the possible
direcitons that a conversation or scenario could take.  You’ll need
the short-term memory and listening skills to empathize with your
fellow performers.  You’ll also need the spontaneity and creativity to
create novel situations.  These need to be novel both to the audience
and to the performers.  <em>*In order to judge whether or not something
is novel, you need to understand how various situations &amp;
possibilities are similar to each other, *which is kind of a
mathematic basis for creativity.</em> ** Thus, improv can improve empathy,
but also spontaneity by developing our subconscious ability to
preprocess these scerarios in order to present our conscious mind with
possibilities.</p>

<p><a name="directing"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-directingposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmldirecting-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#directing">Directing</a></h3>

<p>Directing requires innate understanding of the perception of how a
scene and a work will be perceived.  Like actors, directors need the
same inner vision to develop possibilities of how a writer’s vision
will be portrayed.  Furthermore, they need to understand more
generalized patterns of portraying this vision.  Directors need to
understand how the senses can be used to direct the focus of the
audience, similar to how a writer must understand how their words will
direct the thoughts of the audience.  Directors must then use these
techniques to create a controlled experience that facilitiates the
audience’s exploration of greater ideas behind the work.</p>

<p>Additionally, directors must understand more about the logistics
behind the production of a work.  Similar to how a painter coordinates
his various techniques towards implementing his vision, a director
needs to coordinate with production and other teams to help
orchistrate these logistics.  Certain scenes require specific lighting
that focuses the viewer’s attention, so a director needs to be aware
of those details.</p>

<p>The director is going to be more focused on overall definite and
indefinite meaning of their work than the actors.  So they need to
understand the abilities and tendencies of their actors, in order to
accurately portray their vision.  The best directors sort of funnel
their audience through a very specific experience.  Quentin
Tarantino’s Jackie Brown is a spectacular example of this, as are his
other works.</p>

<p>Obviously, directing movies isn’t possible for everyone.  But
meditating on what it would be like to direct a work and on the
processes used to create the work is a powerful exercise.</p>

<p><a name="skateboarding"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-skateboardingposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmlskateboarding-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#skateboarding">Skateboarding</a></h3>

<p>Like tricking, skateboarding develops spatial awareness, but it
requires an acute understanding of how to manipulate an object as an
extension of your body.  Skateboarding requires extremely quick
reflexes, so you develop muscle memory and balance.  But in order to
develop the techniques required for moves, you need to be creative in
how you approach the problems.  In addition to learning specific
moves, you also need to be capable of understanding certain
generalized techniques, such as countering each foot’s motion with the
other foot so that the board remains centered below your body.</p>

<p>So you need considerable muscle memory, but it’s a dynamic kind of
muscle memory.  As you further generalize the moves, you have
instantly be in tune with how your movements and foot motions affect
each other and the board.  You need to develop a spatial awareness
that allows you to know the board position and rotation based on feel,
rather than sight.  I’ll further discuss skateboarding technique in
part five, using category theory to model the interactions.</p>

<p>Similar to how a parkour runner can’t help but walk through life
seeing all the possibilities around them, a skater will also observe
these opportunities for challenge and self-expression.</p>

<p><a name="martial-arts"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-martial-artsposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmlmartial-arts-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#martial-arts">Martial Arts</a></h3>

<p>Martial arts might be one of the most rewarding pursuits.  It
interests me most because sparring requires the conditioned,
subconscious application of physical strategy.  Similar to chess, it
requires backwards induction and ideation of paths to reach a
particular objective.  In contrast to chess, it’s much more crucial to
be capable of empathizing with your opponent in order to read their
strategy.  Development of such a strategy requires short-term memory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the
result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy,
for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know
neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” -
Sun Tzu</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As sparring is not a strictly defined turn-based game, it’s much more
loosely defined than chess.  It requires a kind ineffable mental
process to reactively construct the physical application of strategy.
You need to be aware of how your actions are perceived by your
opponent in order to understand how your opponent is constructing
their perception of you.  What I find most interesting is this
reactive development of a particular kind of strategy &amp; tactics, the
goal of which is to be incapable of being completely understood by
your opponent.  A strategy for which counter-tactics cannot be
predicted or defined or understood cannot be strategically unraveled.
There’s that math again: how do you identify patterns which were
specifically developed to be indefinable?  How do you develop or
define patterns or strategies specifically to escape definition?</p>

<h4 id="or-as-the-tao-te-ching-so-eloquently-states">Or as the Tao Te Ching so eloquently states:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao</p>

  <p>The name that can be named is not the eternal name</p>

  <p>The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth</p>

  <p>The named is the mother of myriad things”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But martial arts is physcial and requires muscle memory.  I posit that
by entangling empathy, spatial awareness, strategy and muscle memory,
that martial arts develop certain orchestrations of cognitive
functions that can be generalized in many other situations.  Martial
arts requires spatial awareness of self, but also of your opponent.
You need to be able to read your opponent to understand his or her
capabilities.  You need to learn to defend critical spaces, such as
generally blocking the critical space around your face.  Balance is
key.  Disrupting balance means that your opponent’s space of applyable
reactions becomes extremely limited – a key concept in game theory –
so understanding how balance works in general is fundamental to
martial arts.  But you must be capable of strategizing with these
inferences.  And it’s ironic how crucial empathy is to martial arts.
You must clearly see how your opponent sees.</p>

<p>Like skateboarding, fencing and kendo also require spatial awareness
generalized to an object.  Whereas, with skateboarding, your learned
behaviors focus on a single object type, with weapon techniques, you
tend to start generalizing the object itself.  As you examine
different combinations of weapons, you’ll learn about advantaged and
disadvantaged scenarios and how the weapon choice affects the space
you need to defend.  Techniques for various weapons also affect
available stances while attacking or defending, which enable you to
determine how best to throw your opponent off balance.  You would have
no time to consciously think about this while sparring, but as you
train, you condition your subconscious to deal with these various
situations.  And through training, you relegate technique and other
processes to your subconsious, which further frees your conscious mind
to explore strategy when employing these techniques.</p>

<h4 id="bruce-lee-demonstrating-mastery-of-spatial-awareness">Bruce Lee Demonstrating Mastery of Spatial Awareness</h4>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SncapPrTusA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In the video above, Bruce Lee demonstrates a mastery of spatial
awareness, as applied to a strategic situation.  However, be aware
that the coordination of nunchuku technique requires time.  Bruce
Lee’s choice of nunchuku movements restricts the space of movements
available next.  So success in this game not only requires mastery of
technique, but also mastery of the coordination of technique to ensure
versatility of next available techniques.  Additionally, you need
acute understanding of your opponent’s options in order to coordinate
these techniques to allow your self the time and available
reactions. However, as you’ll see with category theory, you find that
your model is never really restricted.  Instead of only considering
the next available moves, you simply start understanding the nature of
how moves can be combined.  In this way, you’ll find that your
behavior can never truly be pigeon-holed, as long as you respect and
avoid certain conditions throughout the game. Therefore, with
experience, you retain the ability to react to nearly any situation.</p>

<p><a name="languages"></a></p>

<h3 id="x2297-languagesposts2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-threehtmllanguages-1">⊗ <a href="/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html#languages">Languages</a></h3>

<p>More important for cognitive development than martial arts or even
programming, learning multiple languages not only furthers your
cultural understanding, but also enables you mind to generalize the
metaphysical data that language encodes. This is especially true when
learning more differentiated languages, but less useful when learning
Romance languages, since they typically encapsulate the same
relationships between concepts.  Romance languages have diverged
fairly signifantly though.  Learning a new language is most effective
during early childhood, which is where the benefits of conceptual
abstraction will also be the greatest.  This is why it’s unfortunately
ironic for certain Americans to disdain bilingualism.</p>

<p>In conversation, a language holistically coordinates the entire brain.
Therefore, in respect to the mind, language could be considered as
it’s own dimension.  That is, the same concepts and ideas can be
abstracted for expression in multiple lanuages.  Because abstraction
requires generalization, then after learning more languages, the mind
would begin to transcend the dimension of language.  And therefore,
IMO, your mind becomes moreso capable of directly understanding
concepts and their relationships, without having languages and words
as parameters.  Instead it deals with pure semantics of concepts.</p>

<p>Learning new languages with alternative written expression teaches us
more about phonetics and increases the efficiency and proficiency for
visiual symbolic recognition and manipulation.  New languages are
challenging, requiring short-term memory to support the learning
processes, as well as very proficient long-term memory to support
retention of vocabulary.  Learning new word order and expanding out of
the traditional SVO of Romantic languages is interesting, indeed.  In
computer science and in Chomsky’s works, you’ll find these tree-based
parsing concepts everywhere and essential for the development of
programming languages.</p>

<h3 id="negative-activities">Negative Activities</h3>

<p>There’s plenty of examples of negative activities, that enable you to
lull your cognition and turn your brain off.  These include watching
TV, aimlessly browsing social media and others.  While sometimes
watching TV can allow you to reflect on the story and characters, it’s
too easy for your brain to do passively.  More active pursuits, even
video games, are much better.  Video games can actually be quite
beneficial to the mind, to some extent.  World of Warcraft can teach
people the value of fulfilling a role in a group, just like the
example of playing in a band listed above.  However, ideally, you’ll
have some variety to the activities you pursue, which will include
some with physical activity.  Logging into WoW for 40+ hours a week
isn’t beneficial unless you’re a pro gamer.</p>

<h2 id="the-similarity-of-all-things">The Similarity of All Things</h2>

<p>Many are trapped believing that they are incapable of learning
quickly, that it’s not worthwhile. Unfortunately, many people lack the
mental modeling required to efficiently learn new things.  IMO, the
lack of efficient and robust modeling for cognition and metacognition
is one reason some people seem to learn much faster, while others
barely keep up.  I believe that early childhood experiences and
thought processes determine intelligence and cognitive functionality
moreso than genetics.  This is why family and early childhood care are
crucial for development.</p>

<p>Our beliefs determine what experiences we’re willing to try, as well
as how many times we’ll be willing to keep trying when we fail.  Our
behavioral metaprogramming and programming determine how we approach
problems and whether we continue to practice on our own or wait for
someone else to show us.  Our outlook on life determines the
perspective with which we choose to view failure, as well as the light
we cast it in.</p>

<p>But for those who have the determination and versatile perspective
required for perseverence, a more expansive system of modeling can
facilitate learning. You can choose to learn new activities, just to
expand your cognitive skills.  The repeated metacognition required for
introspection becomes more natural the more often you do this.  As
your conscious mind constructs models per-category, the subconscious
generalizes these models so they can be reused for other processes.
But if you have the powerful ability to construct models for any
category, then you can use the conscious mind to deconstruct anything
into a familiar model.</p>

<p>It is extremely powerful to have the capability to see the
similiarities in all things.  The more you understand how and why all
things are similar, then the more you can apply your acquisition of
knowledge towards the acceleration of learning.  More simply, the more
you know, the faster you learn new things - because they are all
similar.  But also, the more you’ve learned, the more proficient your
cognitive abilities are, which provides further acceleration.</p>

<p><strong>Your rate of learning is a function of (1) everything you know (2)
your ability to interrelate your knowledge to model new things (3)
the proficiency of each base cognitive function and (4) your ability
to coordinate those cognitive functions.</strong> Therefore, by improving
on any of these four points, you will accelerate your rate of
learning.</p>

<h2 id="part-four-a-universal-model">Part Four: A Universal Model</h2>

<p>And so, it’s not enough to just see how all things are similar.  In
order to optimize the contribution of new knowledge towards the
acceleration of learning, we also need to discover and understand a
unified framework of modeling any problem space.  And that framework
is category theory.  Part four provides an overview of category theory
– at least, from my imperfect understanding of it – and describes my
experience in discovering why it’s so flexible.</p>
