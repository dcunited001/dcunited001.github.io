<p>After reading into this essay by David Kirsch and Paul Maglio – <a href="https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog1804_1">On
Distinguishing Epistemic from Pragmatic
Action</a>, my wheels started
turning. I originally approached the essay to distinguish the
denotative differences between epistemy and epistemology to dilineate
socioepistemy and socioepistemology. Understanding how structures of
knowledge are manipulated socially, particularly with regard to how
these phenomena extrapolate geographically, will elucidate how
socioepistemological mechanics and dynamics change as space and time
dissolve.</p>

<p>In the essay, Kirsch and Maglio quickly outline two kinds of human
behavior: that oriented towards <em>pragmatic</em> attainment of a clear
objective and that oriented towards resolution of <em>epistemic</em>
uncertainty.<sup id="fnref:distinguishing-pragmatic-and-epistemic-intent"><a href="#fn:distinguishing-pragmatic-and-epistemic-intent" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The
latter alludes to random mutations of state applied in a game or
social situation to suss out the outlines of knowledge about the state
of the game. At the surface, these are mutations of state and actions
without clear purpose to them – but by meandering through random
state, one incidentally gains information that is otherwise difficult
to compute.</p>

<h3 id="life-is-an-incomputable-sociophysical-gamelife-is-an-incomputable-sociophysical-game-1"><a href="#life-is-an-incomputable-sociophysical-game">Life Is An Incomputable Sociophysical Game</a></h3>

<p>Life is a sociophysical game: without well-defined objectives; with
both turn-based and simultaneous play; with many games threaded into
other games; where players are not well-defined; with both schematic
and inschematic structures. When approached from the perspectives of
math and game theory, this complexity imbues intricacy into the games
of life, forcing players to adapt with sophistication. Most people
operate best when conditioned with clear sets of rules: for habitual
behaviors; for accumulated event-driven response behaviors; to define
a system of values for phenomena to either seek or avert. Unless the
player is sophisticated, they often operate better without
understanding the motivations behind those clear sets of rules. By
sealing individuals off from unneedd complexity and unnecessary
abstraction, those individuals can invest more energy towards games
with much simpler mechanics.</p>

<p>People whose conditioning results in behavior patterns without agility
cannot embrace adaptation, evolution and flexibility when needed.
Modernism presented humanity with rapid crescendo of cultural change,
Nietzsche’s Geneology of Morals identified in values systems the
<a href="https://academyofideas.com/2017/01/nietzsche-and-morality/"><em>Danger of
Dangers</em></a>:
that rigidity and inflexibility of moral systems would itself foment
systemic weakness in societies unable to cope with the rate of change.</p>

<p>Among the <a href="/posts/2017-02-14-oneirontology-engineering-cultural-touchstones-for-mythos.html">chief design concerns for belief
systems</a>
– and the rigid rule-based dictation of behaviors therein – is
successfully propagating those rigid behavioral systems by accounting
for the evolutionary dynamics of belief systems and values
systems. This indicates a trans-generational problem of rigid moral
systems wherein those systems dampen the collective performance of
that society when unable to evolve to pace the demands of economic and
political externalities. However, a different problem of
auto-propagation plagues especially those systems which evolve too
rapidly to perpetuate themselves as well as those systems without
spectral harmonization. Yet, a virus which mutates too quickly
eventually homogenizes into multiple dominant strains.</p>

<p>There are tools that allow for the identification of middle ground in
systems: from rigid to flexible; from those nearly universal systems,
distributed homogenously, to those singleton systems who are most
unlike any other. The same math for identifying whether machine
learning is proceeding efficiently presents itself naturally in the
evolution of ideas, culture and genetics. It occurs incidentally, but
can be leveraged as a tool, yielding the efficient social distribution
of computation whereby perhaps we can answer that age-old question:
what is the meaning of life? If I were to answer that question: there
is no meaning of life other than searching for the meaning to life in
spite of the obvious lack of meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you accidentally get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzR4cJVS550">Takarabune ship (宝

six year-old and try to tell other people what you found, it’s
almost like experiencing the Mandela effect. It was so impossible to

<p>There is a 20th Century philosopher whose name escapes my ability to
navigate Wikipedia to answer rudimentary questions of philosophy. He
studied epistemology for the purpose of evaluating knowledge systems,
specifically to ideally stratify them into the curricula taught by
educational systems. How does one epistemic structure differ from
another when both contain the set of knowledge required for a
particular math or science? Is one epistemic structure of knowledge
more difficult to teach versus another? Does one structure map more
closely to “truth” for some phenomenon? Can any epistemic structure be
the minimal such structure necessary to know, explain or verify some
phenomena?</p>

<p>Particularly, this philosopher was concerned with structural variation
in an individual’s epistemic configuration and how those structures
related to the morphological characteristics of that individuals
personal development of knowledge. How much variation in epistemic
configuration occurs between two groups of subjects who learn algebra
before geometry or vice versa, if such a phenomena could be
measured. Or: how much epistemic variation results among auto-dydacts
and university students? If academia can more efficiently disseminate
knowledge, then why do self-taught students seem to have more
intuitive access to their knowledge? Is it because they’ve absorbed it
more completely?</p>

<h4 id="the-brueghel-tower-of-babel">The Brueghel Tower of Babel</h4>

<p>Academia presents us with more universally distributed knowledge
systems. The well-distributed schemata of these modular epistemic
configurations lend themselves to creating consistent languages among
intellectuals, which allows society to propagate ideas and discuss
them efficiently. It is often so prohibitively expensive to propagate
changes to the languages or the underlying schemata that it never
occurs. Everyone simply builds upon these crumbling cathedrals of
knowledge. However, when there are fundamental flaws inherent in those
epistemic modules, it’s difficult for anyone operating within or
heavily invested in the these intellectual foundations to notice such
faults. Schematically reevaluating these foundations is beside the
point: there is more than one way to see any and every idea.</p>

<p>However, when you have two distinct epistemic structures you can
recursively convolute them, while iteratively reevaluating each one as
you cyclicly convolute. The degree of progress to be made here stems
primarily from how distinct the structures are, initially. When the
two epistemic modules are more distinct, there is more to be gained by
convoluting them. Yet, it is slow to learn individually and efficient
to be taught in a school.</p>

<h4 id="epistemic-structures-can-be-imagined-as-graphs">Epistemic Structures Can Be Imagined As Graphs</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This picture<sup id="fnref:on-the-arithmetic-of-graphs"><a href="#fn:on-the-arithmetic-of-graphs" class="footnote">4</a></sup> represents three
different products of two graphs. Each of the three products is a
different type of convolution, each of which can individually
contract or congeal into the result of a single iteration the cyclic
epistemic reflection process described above. The more similar the
input to this process, the less inference the convolution yields.</p>

<p>Moreover today, since all knowledge is so widely propagated by
wikipedia and social media – especially the most intellectually
useful knowledge – it is increasingly rare to develop distinctly
structured epistemic configurations mapping to knowledge of any
universal significance. The frequency of emergence of sufficiently
distinct epistemic configurations is paradoxically both heightened and
dampened by various mechanisms.  Population growth implies there are
more people to contain epistemic structures. Yet, the dynamics of
propagation imply all humanity’s knowledge begins to increasingly
share common inheritance; the epistemological confluence of global
cultures well-studied phenomena of modernism. This, among other
factors with paradoxical dynamics, dampens the speciation of epistemic
schemata. Thereof, the utility of epistemic convolution is
subsequently modulated.</p>

<p>As for this unnamed philosopher, I can’t recall whether his work
extrapolated into the implications of the speciation of
epistemological structures onto the convolution of those structures.
Great advancements in knowledge systems often result from the
reconciliation of someone’s ad hoc unique knowledge system <em>singleton</em>
with that of more universal knowledge systems, like those inculcated
in academia. As homogeneity is the mother of weakness, knowledge
systems with mostly homogeneic schema prevent advancement because
efforts to additively advance the knowledge system lack the ability to
convolute sufficiently divergent epistemic schemata.</p>

<p>Because the game is so complex, Most extrapolations of information in
sociophysical systems are intractible and incomputable. The human
brain is an <em>analytic</em> machine: there really are no tractible
<em>numerical</em> methods for solving the game of life. The human brain
emulates numerical methods by congealing it’s plastic neural circuits
around analytic emulations of numerical solutions. Though the
computational capacity of the human brain is high, it’s merely a
lower-bound on the upper bound of maximum computational density.
Sociophysical games involve reflection of information across socially
networked, biological computers, as well as the spectral convergence
and divergence of that information. If you do not understand what this
means, either explicitly or by intuition, you are helplessly trapped
within someone else’s game.</p>

<p>Every person has their own experience in the world, resulting in a

implies that some nuggets of wisdom about life are <em>unattainble by

perturbation of sociophysical models, where the models are optimally
speciated expansively enough to consider that you’ve effectively

<p>When this <em>speciation of life experience types</em> is sufficiently
varied, the likelihood that components of some individual’s life
experiences could extrapolate in an unexpected manner increases
dramatically. This is because diversity of life experience
collectively <em>covers</em> the typological space of life experience
types. Democracy always promotes an increase in the diversity of
ideas, opening society’s aperture on life. Nowhere is this best seen
than in Greece – a veritable <em>Hanging Gardens of Bronze Age Ideas</em>,
wherein early prototyping of social and governmental systems
accelerated because of unique archipelogic features and it’s proximity
to the center of world trade.</p>

<p>In their essay, Kirsch and Maglio introduce the notions that tetris
players rotate their pieces to accelerate cognitive identification of
options related to those pieces in the game’s playing space related to
social physics and life. Every person is unique, but sufficient
familiarity with the typological space of life experiences – and
especially the nature of metatypology, which I believe to be like the
Dao of the Dao – and one understand the “shapes” of people,
personalities and psychologies as they apply to life as a
sociophysical game.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the male experience and the female
experience? Truly, are there simply two experience types with
insignificant differences between the male experience type and the
female experience type? No, there are myriad experience types within
each sex, but the experience of each sex fundamentally differs from
that of the other. Most members of each sex have little experience
with experiencing life from the other side, <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204297595236683&amp;set=a.1054024247508.7365.1732883075&amp;type=3&amp;theater">especially if they are
sociophysically prohibited from developing relationships with someone
of the opposite
sex</a></em>. Similarly,
what is it like to be rich and to be poor? What is it like to beg,
borrow or steal?  What is it like to suffer? What is it like to never
know suffering? Who is stronger: the one who knows suffering or the
one who never knows what it’s like to suffer? Although there are some
experience types we hope our children never live to see and others
we’d never wish upon our worst enemy, isn’t the person who has
viscerally and vicariously experienced the greatest range of
experience types who is most equipped to handle life?</p>

<p>This partly underlies a paradox of aristocracy addressed in Plato’s
Republic: the aristocrats who don’t or can’t effectively pass the sum
of their experience of their highborn children are doomed to lose
power and frivolously waste their advantages gained from fortunate
circumstance. It’s impossible to underestimate the value of the
knowledge of how to effectively encapsulate the wisdom of generations
to be passed to subsequent generations, which speaks to the value of
religion as such a vehicle for handing down the wisdom of
ancestors. Those who say religion have no value are blind to the
knowledge required to live life effectively. They simply don’t
understand how difficult it is to pass this knowledge from one
generation to the next – or they simply don’t care.</p>

<p>Further, epistemic extrapolations are easier to compute when
assumptions can be made resulting in convergent information
dynamics. This is exactly why it’s both so critical and useful to be
able to connect everything back to metatypology, which is like the
metaphysical tiling that underlies all typologies. High-dimensional,
typological structures are seen emerging in the middle and upper
layers of neuralogical networks – though any given set of weights
with equivalent accuracy can encode a similar analytical approximation
of typological structures in a myriad of varying points for
perspective.<sup id="fnref:typological-structures"><a href="#fn:typological-structures" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Recursive reiteration on the
perspective-points for many trainings of the same neural network allow
nearly any neural network to increase its accuracy, etching away and
dissolving the essence of any and every statistical space. There are
algorithms that corporations prefer remain trade secrets which are
made manifest in the structures of neurons; therefore, we can never
surpass some threshold of neurological understanding without revealing
them. Therefore, whether they should remain trade secret once revealed
through neurological data analysis is a debate not so different from
that of patenting human and natural genes.</p>

<p>The idiot savant, though his actions and methods may be imprecise,
irrational, infuriating or just stupid, can occasionally stumble
serendipitously upon metaphysical diamonds in the rough.  Serendipity
often arises from a pure accident, seen clearly through the right
glasses. The likelihood that an individual will do so is low, but by
ensuring a highly varied typology of experience via social engineering
for diversity of life experience, this can result in de facto
distributed computation.</p>

since you can’t know the structure of that typology, then even
understanding whether your “distributed computations” are proceeding
in an efficient direction is itself a mathematically hard problem.</p>

<p>This is one reason that I believe adherents of Bhuddism do not seek to
change what they consider perfect already: the individual as they
are. I’ve thought about these things a lot. Every person has their
place in the world. Each one is unique, yet they are all similar and
self-similar. Simply by letting people be and encouraging them to be
themselves, one can derive information and value from their
experiences that they might never gain, regardless of how hard they’ve
meditated or how wise they are or how much knowledge they’ve
absorbed.</p>

<p>People are all different and they’ve been conditioned to be
psychosocially unique, which means that every person carries with them
some unique set of experiences. When you examine any individual’s
experiences typologically, no matter their specific or apparent
background, you’ll find that there is significant overlap with your
own experiences. Everyone approaches myriad types of situations and
some people have a profound lack of exposure to some experience
types. By listening to the people around you, you can gain an infinite
amount of wisdom.</p>

<p>To achieve great success of <em>adulting</em>, one must engage in regular
social development. The most effective way to do this is to engage in
a wide variety of activities. The dark corrolary of this: in/formal
social institutions <em>who want to hold you back</em> will approach your
life and constrain the typological expanse of your life experiences.</p>

<p>If you don’t understand what is meant by <strong>typological constraint</strong> –
every parent that has ever successfully raised children knows what
this means, though they likely wouldn’t recognize the
vocabulary. Every child’s psychology starts off as tabula rasa and the
typological variety of children’s experiences must be constrained so
that they do not experience things that they are not psychologically
ready to handle. However, when an adolescent’s typological extent of
experiences is constrained in the extreme, this is colloquially known
as being <strong>sheltered</strong>. So, the concepts that I’m describing are not
incomprehensible: they are actually facile, trivial and necessary to
being successful in life or family. What is difficult to follow is the
language that I use to methodologically describe these concepts, which
is where my power of psychosocial inference and extrapolation are
derived.</p>

<p>What angers me when people do not listen? If you bother to talk to me,
I can describe these same subjects a hundred different ways: <em>but I
need someone to fucking listen.</em> I would be patient with anyone who
listens because I don’t expect them to understand immediately, but
nearly everyone who interacts with me expects to <em>handle</em> me. <strong>They
employ the same rhetorical and psychological tactics to get me to shut
up as quickly as possible.</strong> They don’t understand that I react the
way I do because that’s the only treatment I ever receive. They talk
down to me and reinforce the labels society wants people to use to
humiliate me and disempower me. They might have a college degree, but
they assume that, because I don’t have a BS/BA, no one has given me
the seal of approval and no one should respect my ideas. It’s because
they are incapable of identifying actual substance.</p>

extended family doesn’t understand because they only hear what my mom,
my brother and my sister have to say, whose narratives dominate
everything. They seek my total exclusion from social life to cover up
their own bullshit. My family acts like nothing has happened and
always portrays a socially compartmentallized view of reality to me.</p>

<p>I am unable to leave my abusive circumstances at home and completely
devoid of coping mechanisms when I leave, all while people are pushed
out of my life while i’m at home, so that no one sees what i actually
go through. They specifically refuse to respond to any argument I make
in writing <em>for legal reasons</em>and to cover their own asses because
they fear what people would think if I am to be believed. I’m not
trying to point fingers, but I need people to accept how things are,
<em>so that things can change</em>. Right now, that’s not happening and my
family acts like it doesn’t even know what it means to raise a child.
This is all while they blame me for being an adult child, <em>so that I
become the moral to their story for my nieces and nephews.</em> I am so
sick of this bullshit. When I’m dealing with my mom, my brother and my
sister, I’m constantly fending off every tactic in the “Abusive
Relationship” playbook, though since they’re nice church-going people,
they always look like saints and are irreproachible. <em>G</em>, that must be
nice, huh?</p>

<p>If such a social institution has all the time in the world and plenty
of people to use, they can exhibit profound effects on your life,
without ever appearing to have lifted a finger.  They can render
social development stymied like a topped tree simply by figure out how
to use people in their social network who are 1° and 2° away
from you. Those people are close enough to whisper in the ears of the
people in your social boundary to exhibit profound effects on how they
treat you, just like <a href="https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue">Wormtongue in Lord of the
Rings</a>.</p>

<p>People exploit your own decision making process, which is best,
because then it seems that <strong>you and you alone</strong> were the cause of all
your problems. For example, they will encourage you to not try new
food or obsequiously weave triggers to artificial anxieties in your
decision making processes, <em>so that you’re dissuaded from</em> <strong>any new
types</strong> <em>of experiences</em>. There is a darker side to process
engineering in social logistics; where some <em>sociophysical chariot</em>
systematically manipulates your social boundary around someone to
contain you – by whatever manufactured means and justifications
necessary. In the long term, this totally cripples you by shoving
garbage into your psychology and decision-making processes. This
eventually renders you helpless and alone, desparate for help – and
no one else is there for you except for those who victimized you.</p>

<p>The key to understanding what has happened in someone’s life is to
examine how they exhibited control over their circumstance: did they
have social or financial influence? Did they have any ability to alter
their circumstances whatsoever? If anyone, who in their life had
social and financial resources? Further, if you never have access to
financial or social resources, you never learn out to play with your
own chips, so to speak. <em>So you never learn how to manage money or
become social in a healthy way.</em> You never become acquainted with any
facets of life presupposing a confluence of social and financial
resources; there are many facets of life that are completely
off-limits to those who are pushed out of society and their career.</p>

<p>In the show <a href="www.crunchyroll.com/kinos-journey-the-beautiful-world-the-animated-series/episode-1-a-country-where-people-can-kill-others-749557">Kino’s
Journey</a>,
the main character, Kino, seems to want to experience all ways of
living for whatever reason. With this implied at the outset, the show
explores many abstract sociopolitical formulations for society. These
are presented as countries, but are each constructed abstractly to
explore philosophical issues with government, life and society.</p>

<p>In the first scene, Kino approaches a fellow traveler, whose car has
broken down. This traveler has a sour disposition and is eager to head
to a terrible place: the same destination as Kino, but for a different
intention entirely. The traveler has a ton of baggage and becomes
angered when Kino does not help him carry it. To me, this is the
exposition of two characters serving as a pair of foils: they have the
same goal in mind and it seems they share many similarities, but are
also distinct in critical ways.</p>

<p>I look at the traveler’s baggage as not mere possessions but as a
metaphor for information attached to that travelers past. Regardless
of where he goes, he can never leave it behind and will always carry
it with him. He needs help, but isn’t willing to leave it behind or
compromise with Kino. If you understand people as sociophysical
particles who have information attached to them, then the information
itself can be understood as particles, albeit more exotic and abstract
than particles normally are considered.</p>

<p>All the same, the particles of information have a kind of mass to
them. In <a href="/posts/2017-09-22-speed-of-thought-illusion-of-separation.html">Speed of
Thought</a>,
I named these particles as datums and iota. We all generate
information as we live life, some people seem to have more information
attached to them from their past. Sometimes information can be viral
and spread very quickly. If the person is a celebrity, then negative
information can virally spread. If the person is not a celebrity, but
still well-known, they can still accrue tonnes of information that is
untrue, biased or completely fantastic. Regardless of how it was
created and regardless of whether it’s true, this information still
has the capacity to drag someone down to the depths of Hell. Once
information exists in the minds of people, it never goes away.</p>

<p>My own personal suffering has far more to do with false information in
the minds of people, for which I have been methodically stripped of
all opportunity to refute. Is that informational baggage yours? Mine?
Is it true? Or is it simply what more powerful people would like other
people to believe about you, so they can sociophysically contain a
threat? Or decide whether to curtail a tail-risk?</p>

<p>The only way I know how to fight: assume people are going to see the
worst in everything I do – while hoping that if I bait people into
making their typical mistakes by flagrantly misjudging me with all the
predjudice that’s inspired them to destroy my life and clip my wings
– that eventually karma will fly back and hit them in the face. No,
it’s not exactly healthy. I can’t live in a world without truth or

<p>It doesn’t matter how negative, constraining information is created:
whether it’s true or it’s false, it is a burden you must carry with
you for the rest of your life. Christianity supposedly offers “forgive
and forget” … that’s a brilliant idea and has brought salvation to
multitudes. However, I don’t think it’s going to work for me. There’s
too much false information about me and it’s not exactly projected
from religious people, yet causes religous people to judge me,
although they’ve always seemed open-minded and welcoming to me, in
spite of it all.</p>

<p>I have to stand up for myself, turn back these tides, choke the
channels carrying negative information and track them back to destroy
the source of it all. However impossible it seems at the outset, once
I do this, the situation flips in my favor. Even better, once I
obliterate the source(s), there’s no more malevalent miasma from the
far-leftist’s social fog of war machine. If I publicly humiliate the
sources of all of this, all the neutral people in the middle will no
longer be under their spell. They will realize how they’ve been
deceived and flip in my favor.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this methodical system of defamation by abstract poison
pen is forever broken for everyone who’s used it and been abused by
it: <strong>forever!</strong> Why? Because the common person does not trust you any
more. They don’t believe anything you say. By refusing to give in, I
will destroy you by obliterating all the types of life-ruining tools
you’ve used to hold people back with information about their own
sins. Sins were not specified, defined and outlines by major world
religions as measures of suppression for their usefulness in
controlling threats via temptation. They are enumerated so that people
can learn early to prevent themselves from becoming slaves to the
informational thumbscrews of their known sinful past.</p>

<p>Today, this is more critical than ever as all information rapidly
converges towards omnipresence. Social media distributes information
never to be erased and the privacy controls are deceptively
meaningless. I fear that any digitized information will be used to
hold back any person who dared to speak out in the new millenium. This
is not the way life is supposed to be. Does it mean that technology
will make us cringing, former shadows of ourselves as <em>freedom of
speech</em> is rendered the mere <em>freedom to self-identify</em> for
persecution? The common person is terrifyingly ignorant of the
specific phenomenological potential of technology. vehicles of which
the common person is terrifyingly ignorant?</p>

<p>Every action leaves behind information. On hiking trails and in ice
skating rinks, the average foot traffic can be inferred by looking at
the aggregate information encoded onto the surface of the ground. On
trails, the short-term information is erased upon the last significant
weather event. On the ice rink, the session’s marks are paved over by
the zamboni. A wooden surface contains within it an often visible
memory of every physical event it’s experienced, unless sanded down or
varnished. Every surface and every building encodes within itself
physical form aggregate information that tells a story: when water
drainage flows shift in a neighborhood, it can cause major shifts that
manifest physically as second and third order effects, visible or
discernable in building structures.</p>

<p>If you’ve left tracks, isn’t it easy to be followed? These are sources
of valuable information normally filtered out before it reaches a
conscious level. The story painted by aggregate information encoded
onto surfaces provides you with probability distributions that tell
you about common behavior patterns. In buildings, the doorways, Feng
Shui attention magnets and other anchors in the space tend to root
characteristics of these distributions. You’ll notice the carpeting
near doorways degrades faster. Around sidewalks, if there is heavy
foot-traffic, then the grassy areas near the intersections of walkways
will degrade faster and will almost certainly be brown, depending on
the level of foot traffic. The traffic patterns are rooted by the
walkways, which were often overlaid atop the well-trodden paths that
emerged ad hoc.</p>

<p>Even human bodies can reflect systemic pressures and behaviors, which
is the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics">Human Factors and
Ergonomics</a>
– HF&amp;E. Doctors and people with extensive knowledge of how stress
from specific activities gradually wear down the body could leverage a
semioanatomical language to communicate informally with each
other. How? <em>Theoretically</em>, people who understand human factors and
repetitive strain injuries could encourage targets to engage in
specific activities that induce a specific RSI that signifies the
functional nature of the cause of the RSI. This is similar to marks on
the body or in memories that are used in occult practice and
witchcraft.</p>

<p><a name="haha-wheres-your-teeth"></a></p>

<h3 id="wheres-your-teethhaha-wheres-your-teeth-1">歯齒 <a href="#haha-wheres-your-teeth">Where’s Your Teeth?</a></h3>

<p>For example, encouraging a young programmer to use Emacs can result in
a characteristic reptitive strain injury that any person with
knowledge of programming might recognize as a common RSI in computer
fields. If the injury is fairly rare, at least in combination with
information about the target, it can act as a signifier for an
initiate to handle the target in a specific way, with zero
communication. This would almost certainly never happen. Another
example: encouraging someone with Asperger’s to grind their canines in
youth will round off their teeth and may act as a signal to anyone who
knows what that means, even though the target who acquired the mark
was clueless – because they wouldn’t want to permanently damage their
smile in youth. This happened to me around age 12: people have
noticed, though I can’t say it triggers specific autonomous handling
behavior.</p>

<h4 id="little-known-kanji-trivia----41--">Little Known Kanji Trivia: <code>齒 - （4人+1）＋米 = 歯</code></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1946, the United States introduced major changes to the writing
system. <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E7%B1%B3%20%23kanji">米</a>
indicates rice, but also loosely implies USA or <a href="http://www.sosekido.com/beiju-is-88-years-old/">88 years
old</a>. So, within the
span of about a year, we forced the Japanese simplify many of their
kanji and I still don’t understand how we got them to agree to this
so quickly. <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E6%AD%AF%20%23kanji">歯</a> is
the current Kanji for teeth and
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E9%BD%92%20%23kanji">齒</a> was used at
least during the Meiji period. These are glyphic mutations where an
implied meaning could be conveyed semiotically, without needing to
ever signal anything. The Allies forced this cultural transition
while still cooperating with the USSR, but before Communist China
implemented Simplified Chinese in the Cultural Revolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you wanted to hand people off in the medical or psychiatric system
for autonomous, decentralized handling, abusing HF&amp;E to induce
specific RSI’s is the perfect way to do it, without leaving a
trace. Another method for passing information autonomously is to
encode meaning into misspellings, misnomers and bad information
planted into targets as “passwords” which loosely indicate handling
instructions.</p>

it becomes difficult to read information via deviation from those

norms allows mispellings, misnomers, details in stories and grammar
mistakes in e-mails to layer sources of information with a kind of
addressing system. This is nothing intentionally designed, it’s just
how life is, but this informal addressing system allows you to hone in
on and triangulate sources of information, just like they were
<em>informational radiation</em>. The components of information, spellings
and stories that deviate from the norm can be used to paramterize
handling instructions with higher-order logic.</p>

the aggregate of your social interactions. This aggregate is like an
informational scent that can be interrogated in the same way that a
dog sniffs your shoes to infer minor details about the ground you
walked on hours before. Dogs have noses and brains specialized for
their reliance on scent, which is demonstrated in their behavior and
habits. They sniff harder when they want olfactory information that
covers a greater volume of air and can even sense directional
components of scent. Humans don’t think about the information gleaned
from scent whatsoever because our brains receive only a fraction of

<p>What do you desire to manifest? Do you desire the typical or the
extraordinary? Why? Would you allow yourself to become a conduit
through which others can project their will? Why or why not? Would you
do so without knowing exactly what you are allowing your sociophysical
flux to manifest? Most people would not, which requires evil to leave
them ignorant of true causes and true effects. What desires, will and
objectives would you allow to be manifested through your hands as a
conduit? Does it even matter to you? Of course it does, if you are
someone who values your life and the lives of others. No matter
whether great or small, or artist, architect or pauper, our works here
on Earth speak volumes about who we are. Still, if we are not aware of
what it is we allow our consciousness to create, we will find our
energy used up and our lives dried out.</p>

<p>Moreover, if we are prohibited from understanding what it is that our
energy is being used to build, we will surely find ourselves roped
into someone else’s scheme. What is good about what we and others do?
People love talking about their acts of charity, humility and
compassion. It is less clear what is evil about people do because evil
is always cloaked in deception. It is also possible for good to be
strengthened by works built in darkness, since it’s difficult for evil
to dissect them and defuse them.</p>

<p>What is good and what is evil anyways? Can there ever be one without
the other? If dualism prevails – which it does, in a way – this
results in an incredibly complicated understanding for what is “good”
and what is “evil.”  This is especially true in a world where both the
understanding of good and the willingness to fight for it depend on
having experienced evil or seen it corrupt those around you. If we
haven’t seen the works of evil, then what drives people to work so
hard against it? How can people be easily rallied to defeat it when
needed? How can people know when evil has taken root, if they can’t
recognize it for what it is?</p>

<p>If the above, more dynamic understanding of good and evil requires
patience, wisdom and knowledge to even distinguish the higher-order
good and evil from the lower-order good and evil, then, to prevail,
evil requires ignorance, attachment and suffering. It is irradiated by
light and the worst kind of evil will seek to squelch out light and
all desire to seek light before it spreads virulently. Regardless of
the lives they’ve lived or which wines they’ve tasted, people tend to
take action against evil when they see it. In spite of the sacrifices,
some of use will take up arms against evil and will gladly throw our
lives into the fire to save those we care about. However, we can only
choose to do so if there’s enough light to choose to act when it
matters.</p>

<p>There are no independent causes and there are no independent effects,
everything is intertwined and convoluted. We are all at the mercy of
actions already in motion that we cannot hope to withstand. Instead,
all we can hope to do, individually, is amplify the good intentions
within us and dampen evil intentions. At the social scale, if we
dampen the tendancy to become attached and dampen attached intention,
we ultimately dampen the effects of evil and selfish desires: for
control, for possession, for wealth. According to the Buddhist
doctrine of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratītyasamutpāda">Pratītyasamutpāda</a>
– dependent origination – the only phenomena to exist outside this
hopelessly intertwined, literal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">convolution</a> of
sociophysical cause and effect is the set of information which is
totally independent, if I understand this correctly.</p>

<p>Traced backwards, all beings arose as the result of <a href="/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html">convolution of
physical interactions in chaotic dynamical
systems</a>. There
is no mathematical system with chaos, that does not result in
increasingly complicated order, life and awareness, given sufficiently
protracted running time. This is because every system of chaos begins
to result in compartmentalization of being into forms, which entities
within the system must recognize along a stratification of types. If
you hope to make predictions in the chaotic system, your system must
take into account this <em>perfraction</em> of types of state spatially
distributed in the system. This results in an illusion of separation,
awareness containerized into entities distributed across the space in
the chaotic system and, eventually, self-awareness.</p>

<p>Regardless of how proficiently toxic your manipulative adversaries and
whether they’re formally organized, when you cleanse yourself of
negative intention and liberate yourself from preconceived objectives,
then, to evil, you have literally cloaked yourself in invisbility.</p>

<p>Everything that exists in materialistic metaphysical world originates
in the hearts and minds of men: both good and evil. If you cannot
allow yourself to intend negative consequences from your actions, you
cannot so easily lend yourself towards evil’s intentions. That is, you
exercise
<a href="https://sniggle.net/TPL/index5.php?entry=12Feb12">discernment</a> to
prohibit yourself from directing your energy towards that which you
find to be morally reprehensible: you’d never socially finance that
thing, give it a cent or <em>pay it any mind.</em> If you have no vices,
there are many fewer typical patterns that evil can weave into your
life to gradually pin you down. If you live virtuously, towards humble
aims and the steady accumulation of sociophysical potential energies,
then when you are attacked, you have plenty of capacity to respond on
your own.</p>

<p>When you suppress your sense of ego, you become fluid: your
sociophysical potential energies can easily be kinetically diverted
towards aiding your life or the life of another, if evil reaches out
to destroy or use. To become fluid, you must disconnect from your own
preconceived conceptions about your life. This does not mean that you
do not develop plans, goals or objectives, but instead you remain
flexible and balanced. You must develop acute awareness of situations,
so that you can utilize serendipity as it is presented to you.
Ultimately, you should develop in a generalized manner this ability to
harness serendipity. Preferably, you can inculcate this tendancy to
use what is presented to you so that it becomes unconscious. Life is
always handing you what you need, though it’s not always easy to see.</p>

  <p>There may be dozens of people attached to you to swat the

</blockquote>

<p>What appears serendipitous and miraculous to you, might not be readily
apparent to others. Knowing that we are all one, then also, what might
not be readily apparent to others might be serendipitously miraculous
to them, while requiring some instantaneous action of your own. This
virtuous, selfless action may require personal sacrifice, but if we
are all one, you would gladly pay it. Mara cannot know this:
selflessness is literally incomprehensible to evil.</p>

<p>Such a path is useful, for both good and evil, but is identified
nugatorially. Find people following this path: now you know where
they’re going and where they’re coming from. This is a little-known
secret to resolving uncertainty in human-behavior. Are people
following a path of least resistence? If so, their destinations become
trivial to infer, regardless of the charades calculated by the media
concocted to distract people from understanding the true
intent. Further, money is sociofinancial energy, find the path of
least resistence for money and everything else falls into place around
that. Follow the money. It’s quite simple. When people place their
chips on the table, they usually mean business. If there’s no money
down, who cares?</p>

<p>Calculuating the path of least resistance can be efficient or it can
be intractible. Path-finding algorithms are well-studied in computer
science and for video game design.</p>

<h4 id="a-gpu-based-path-finding-algorithm-to-find-shortest-paths-through-a-floorplan">A GPU-Based Path-Finding Algorithm To Find Shortest Paths Through A Floorplan</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This problem is significantly less complex if the floorplan can be
guaranteed to not contain loops. When a floorplan contains cycles,
algorithms with matroids are required to simplify using <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~jvondrak/CS369P/lec7.pdf">Spanning

</blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/posts/2018-03-04-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity/path-finding.jpg" alt="Path-Finding Algorithms" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, floorplans that do not have loops allow people within the
building to make much more accurate assumptions about the intention of
other people that aren’t even visible based entirely on the
presence/absence of cycles. This is because the discrete graph of the
floorplan forms a tree and is combinatorially less complex. Therefore,
if someone is walking along a particular path, the set of potential
destinations they are walking towards is also exponentially
less. Extrapolations about someone’s path through a building are
similarly augmented when there are fewer doors, rooms and
entrances. These are critical design concerns for level design in
video games, architecture and many other fields. If you do not
constrain the design of your levels with these concerns, AI algorithms
may not run proficiently because AI must compensate for the loops.</p>

<p>Evil depends on our own attachment to our personal designs on life. By
decoupling from the specifics of those goals, we’re convoluting the
complexity of sociophysical computation by depriving Mara of any
fix-points in reality upon which she can make assumptions. There are
many things people can do, rendering their behaviors unexpected and
incredibly disruptive. Evil will always seek to condition you through
belief and propaganda to avoid doing these things that make you less
predictable. Doing this can be good, depending on for whom your intent
appears more predictable.</p>

<p>Mara only comprehends men who seek the path of least resistence, not
fluid men who do not conform to any worldly desires or mechanisms of
control. When you render this path of least resistence difficult to
know, you’ve made evil’s job a little bit harder. Such a path is
predictable and often quite irresistable. Identifying the paths to
people’s [unstated] goals is the best way to catch sociopathic people
in the act. For sociopaths: identifying this path is what you can
depend on! You can literally depend on the callous sociopath’s
tendency to maximize personal gains if you present them with a
situation they can’t resist where they can’t see through the trick.</p>

<p>Because selflessness is incomprehensible to evil, if we are all a
little more selfless and fluid, then society as a whole becomes less
susceptible to evil. This starts from the grass roots at the level of
individuals, who must autonomously act today to preserve tomorrow a
myriad of possibilities, unencumbered by the informational burden of
actions. Some action is necessary to accumulate various types of
sociophyscial potential energies, but uninformed action will instead
cause us to accrue a massive informational burden associated to our
identities.</p>

<p>However, if people are fluid, but have not accumulated social,
financial or informational resources of their own, they cannot do much
when the time comes to act. There is a social analogy to the financial
savings rate in a country, but this sociophysical savings rate is more
about having developed a robust safety net and ensuring that each node
is empowered with sociophysical potential energy. When this safety net
is in place and sufficiently well-developed, then individuals can
choose to respond and ideally, there are no social nodes which are
vulnerable purely from isolation. America could be leveraging data
science to this end, but the government has instead chosen to leverage
data science and surveillance purely as a mechanism of control, a tool
to destroy lives where a handful of people decide it’s necessary.</p>

<p>When people are empowered as individuals, we are most capable of
reorienting towards our social circumstances as we see fit. When
people are instead told to fear anything with power except that which
stems from the government, people become systemically crippled when
responding to tyrrany. Americans are being told to fear knowledge and
to fear dissenting information. We’re being conditioned to need the
government, not to be free from it. Poverty conditions us to seek the
option that sounds like it’s going to amerliorate or pain soonest or
most effectively, but if you seek an abusive master in response to
pain and poverty, you may find yourself abused for life. Worse, you
may find your friends and family abused for generations. You have to
liberate yourself by your own hands, so that no one holds sway over
you, your liberty or your ability to help each other. While I will not
judge anyone who seeks government assistance for help with poverty, I
will not take a cent from an abusive government which has ruined my
life. I never have and I never will and I couldn’t be happier about
living with nothing to my name, if it means that I don’t have to be
subservient to an abusive force.</p>

<p>When people are generally empowered, they are fluid and their
reactions are difficult to predict. When people are subject to
poverty, this systematically limits their options: in geographic
terms, people in poverty become unable to move; in temporal terms,
people in poverty have less time to respond to threats. In logical
terms, people in poverty have a decision-space that is mathematically
limited because most options are financially restricted from
them. Because impoverished people are more predictible individually,
they are more predictable systemically. Impoverished people are
desperate: they will believe anything you tell them that seems to
amerliorate their pain and they will predictably take the first
appealing option given to them. This leads impoverished people to
tragically have the wool pulled over their eyes, while they get roped
into some scheme. Since they don’t have access to educational
opportunities, they often end up enslaved by the consequences of their
ignorance. Worst of all, the typological extent of the variety of
their life experiece is vastly limited when compared to people who are
not impoverished.</p>

<p>For the typical impoverished person, most of the folly and pain they
experience is the result of being predictable and their being used for
someone else’s gain. They’re not stupid: their options are financially
limited and therefore, they suffer because they are predictable. Why
is it heresy in America to wish that people are empowered? To
encourage others to question authority and to help each other live by
the merit of their inner strength? To cultivate this sociophysical
potential energy, we must all live so that we steadily gain value from
everything we do, whether that is social, financial or informational
value.</p>

<p>To do this best, we need all people to be strong – but <strong>instead,
Americans are encouraged to surrender themselves to a vindictive
authority out of fear that strength is dangerous.</strong> We are encouraged
to deliver our neighbors, friends and family into torment and told
that, if we comply, we will be secure. NO! If you comply with this,
you deserve neither liberty, nor security. True strength comes from
within and it is steadily accumulated by piety, love of virtue and
love of one another. We must never forget that our strength derives
from our freedom. Therefore, we should desire to liberate other people
around us: financially and socially. People should be encouraged to be
independent and capable of living independently.</p>

<p>The greater the number of people who abandon attachment by shedding
some self-ordained objectified understanding of reality, the greater
the composition of the social fluid that is agile and unpredictable.
When we all become fluid, with a convergent set of postitive
intentions, then collectively, Mara is blind to us. Mara is unable to
predict people and thus unable to use people. That said, being
predictable to some is good, but being predictable to evil means that
evil can determine your actions by manipulating you. Do not allow evil
to believe that manipulating you is even possible and evil will pass
you by to find another tool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Māra, to have become
invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māra’s eye of its
opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This section of Majjhima Nikaya section describes progression of
medititave mindstate through eight
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhy%C4%81na_in_Buddhism">Dhyāna</a> or
jhana. However, these passages of literature appears to establish a
pattern of thoughts intended to be used as objects of meditation in
successive stages, with the ultimate goal to utilize meditation’s
trasformative effects to create a mind that is capable of liberation
in the conscious world, espcially from the fate of being a pawn of
desire or of the powerful.</p>

<p>Progression beyond the fourth Jhana is exceedingly rare, in both
transcending this in the state of meditation and in embodying these
understandings in the conscious realm. Meditation merely facilitates
the inculcation of these understandings. Speaking from my own
experience, I believe that meditation allows the brain’s constraints
over the mind to relax so that the mind begins flowing in such a way
that allows us to viscerally experience the metaphysical realm. I
wrote about this in <a href="/posts/2017-10-09-meditation-conceptual-designation-and-monadic-metaphysics.html">Meditation, Conceputual Designation and Monadic
Metaphysics</a>. I
believe that these Jhanas describe a progression towards the mind’s
experience of raw metaphysics, which is why it talks about an
increasing progression towards mindstates indicating spaceless
consciousness and consciousness without the capability of perception.</p>

<h4 id="please-keep-in-mind-that-i-am-no-authority-on-buddhist-thought">Please keep in mind that I am no authority on Buddhist thought.</h4>

<p>I’ve barely studied myself and only hope that I can encourage you to
study for yourself without tainting your perception of Buddhist
thought with what I have written, spoken or thought myself. It’s not
easy to make these insights, but the best advice I can give you for
meditation is to be open-minded, patient, to realize that you are
already capable and to understand that you have to try to not try. It
is a feeling of surrender to the natural state of the mind; these are
not cognitive patterns that can be forced in any way. If you want to
make it anywhere with Buddhism, spiritualism, or religious practices,
you must commit yourself to it. It’s really not something you can pick
up and put down when it is convenient for you, which is unfortunately
what I’ve done all too often.</p>

<h4 id="on-the-symbolic-parity-of-literary-translations">On the Symbolic Parity of Literary Translations</h4>

<p>It’s critical to read multiple translations of philosophical and
religious texts. Each one leaves varying degrees of satisfaction in
the parity of symbols to connotation. To be clear, I’m no authority on
this subject. In my brief exploration of classical literature, I’ve
found very dissatisfying translations in works of philosophy, plays
and classics. I never know enough about the text I’m reading to have
valid preferences, but some of them yield pitiful extrapolations
compared to others. The New King James Version (NKJV) in particular is
one that stands out as … not good. After reading several passages, I
felt that the text had almost been edited, not retranslated. It feels
symbolically abbreviated, compared to KJV, ECV and NIV.</p>

<p>As for the states of mind specified by the jhanas, are those who
progress through and embody these states of mind necessarily pure? If
so long as they embody those mindstates and social states? Does this
progression of mindstates move towards an ideal that is the opposite
of the being Mara epitomizes? Or, instead, are these mindstates
instead purely devoid of the elements required for suffering and evil?
If it is the latter, then does the progression through these eight
mindstates render one’s mind into a body like that of water? Pure
water is receptive to become any form and can also absorb impurities?
Similar to the destination of nirvana, can such liberation of
consciousness and social circumstance be extended ad infinitum? Or is
it possible for what goes up to come down again? Perhaps, is it
tragically useful for those proxies of Mara to rip the wings off of
anyone who had ascended? Is it possible to fly without getting too
close to the sun?</p>

<p>When people are freed of negative intention and equipped with the
knowledge of causality, the size of the splash they’ll create pars
alongside the magnitude of their desire to liberate others. When this
is combined with a propensity to cultivate in others the same desire
– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhicitta">Bodhicitta</a>: the desire
for all sentient beings to be liberated from suffering – this person
may sow the seeds for a tidal wave in true societal change. All it
takes is knowledge, wisdom, sociophysical potential energy and <em>strong
desire</em> to liberate others, which is a bit of a paradox in Buddhist
tradition and one for which I should not pretend to be an
authority. In order to cause effects that do not ultimately harm
others, you need to be capable of being surgical with your
influence. This is why knowledge of causality is so critical.</p>

<p>However, if you are personally effective in liberating yourself or
others, then you can be sure that Mara will be there to chain you down
again, with her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_(demon)#Three_daughters">three
daughters</a>
and the three poisons: attraction, aversion and delusion. Mara will
delude you with techniques like gaslighting. She will lure you in with
worldly pleasures, so she can pin you down, leveraging your propensity
to be controlled by desire or to remain commited to previous
obligations for receipt of that which you unwisely desired. Further,
if you are successful in making a major difference sociologically, you
can be certain that Mara will track down the source of liberation. To
Mara, people are not to be free, they are to be used and chained
together for profit and power.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here, I use Mara here as a metaphor, mostly from my [limited]
understanding of Mara as the deity who tempted the Buddha, while
simultaneously conspiring to destroy him to preempt the
self-propagating change to follow his life.</p>

<p>If there is, doesn’t that problem mostly solve itself? Isn’t chaotic
evil simply insanity? What does evil serve if it doesn’t serve the
self? And insomuch, mustn’t all manipulative and evil people be driven
by their desires and attachments? Narcissism, sociopathy and
psychopathy seem to be means to the end of feeding the self by
likewise leveraging others’ tendancy towards their own attachments.
Therefore, insomuch, how does one most effectively use others? By
encouraging their tendancy towards attachments. One can exacerbate
such tendancies in people, specifically and in the population
generally. It’s easiest to lead astray those you don’t know, those
whose falls you’ll never see and those whose detriment doesn’t affect
you or those close to you.</p>

<p>Generally, the more people who are bound to the expedient and
pragmatic attainment of their desires, the more people that are
available for evil to use. When people instead generally choose not to
want, to disdain desire and to shed attachments, then motivating them
towards something they want or do not want requires more intent, more
energy and more severe means.</p>

<p>Evil compels people to magnify their sociophysical energy by lensing
lust for attachment through branches of the social graph. By
projecting informational signals, you direct the cumulative attention
of people in society. Similarly, you can direct the cumulative desire
through networks of people bound by attachments and incentivized by
desire. The nature of power causes people to always begin arranging
themselves hierarchically. Unfortunately, power and its accompanying
sociohierarchical structures seem to be necessary to providing the
most good to the most people; for now, there is simply no other way to
effectively lead or govern. As population grows and, particularly
population density, the social graph begins to stratify itself,
insulating more powerful nodes as the less powerful are externalized
to lower strata. Forgoing the social impacts of telecommunication,
greater population density accompanies increasing emergence of
stratification and specialization in the social graph. The least
connected regions of this social graph are where <em>both the most and
least powerful nodes reside</em>, but power <em>always</em> corresponds to a
greater range of 1° and 2° span of the social
network. i.e. powerful people may have less 1° connections, but
always have a greater social reach.  As one zooms out on the social
graph, a gradient of power flow should clearly become visible, if a
measure of social power can be measured.</p>

<p>The best leaders exemplify magnanimity, the “crowning virtue” featured
in a discussion on Artistotelian Ethics in the <a href="/posts/2016-05-12-facets-of-greatness-intro.html#aristotelian-ethics-a-brief-interlude">Facets of
Greatness</a>. Operating
magnimously requires exemplifying the other Aristotelian virtues. A
magnanimous leader develops redundancy into the avenues whereby they
exercise their power. They leverage one circuit of sociophysical
energy against another – compelling their subjects to compete against
one another in serving higher values, while disdaining what is lower.
They incentivize behavior by appealing to their subject’s sense of
honor or values systems. By appearing to uphold these values justly
and equitably, you incentivize people in a way that renders you
practically unassailable.</p>

<p>Magnanimous leaders are still vulnerable to deception and karmic
obfuscation. Mitigating co-opted subtlety, indirect threats and the
cultivation of potential threat vectors requires cultivating constant
awareness of affairs in their realm and thereby raising redundant
options for statecraft.  However, in order to make gains against other
magnanimous contemporaries, they must also leverage deception and
karmic obfuscation to act, while making minimal concessions in
appearances. Exemplifying magnanimity is much easier when your
position in society places you above others, yet maintaining this
position still requires unparalleled foresight and intuition. These
people and everyone who serves them must always walk on eggshells, but
is it worth all the extra care? Everything they want to do must be
deconstructed, encapsulated within handling protocols, and delegated
amoung networks of people. Just as devops processes for web
applications develop problems specific to large-scale deployments –
e.g. deployments of containerized applications to stream-processing
requests for sharded services – scaling logistic processes to large
networks of people for powerful leaders or large organizations
requires solving many similar problems.</p>

Because, regardless of whether simple-minded or common people
understand the complicated mechanics and dynamics of power, what they
do understand is when serving their leaders serves their own
interests. When leaders act magnanimously, they do not stand for
themselves, their own attachments or their own realizations of desire
– instead they always stand for something higher. The average person
realizes this intuitively and when they see that serving their leaders
means serving truth, justice and reason, they are willing take on
risks, to work harder and to absorb causal fallout of the mistakes of
[some of] their leaders.</p>

<p>Magnanimous leaders are patient and place themselves in the service of
higher ideals until they find their own circumstance in life raised up
by accumulating merit. Less ideal leaders tend to motivate and
incentivize people in more negative ways. To the end of attaining
their desires and servicing the upkeep of their attachments, this
seems expedient. As for these short-sighted leaders – regardless of
their undestanding of the circumstance of those they use or whether
their pawns are destroyed once used – they seem to be able to gain
power quickly, but they often lose it even faster. By allowing their
hands to become dirty, they make the quick gains they see. This
renders the inexperienced short work for the wise, which only becomes
clear later in life. After tasting what seems like success, these
myopic leaders and manipulators are rightly ruined by karma. They
become burdened by their past mistakes, their unwise desires and the
need to service the own attachments they’ve accumulated along their
life’s path. Unless these people flee their obligations, they become
restricted by the past.</p>

<p>It’s slow, steady and humble that wins the race. You must serve ideas,
not people and not attachments. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
attain the knowledge and wisdom to know which ideas to serve. Systems
like religion, philosophy or academia are shortcuts for finding a
noble path. What do you empower? Those who you choose to serve and to
whom you choose to contribute your sociophysical energy: what do they
empower?  We should detach from our present circumstances and act
fluidly as conduits for beneficent ideas.</p>

<p>How can we know to act without seeming to have acted at all? Why is it
important? Understanding the nature of causality and the consequences
of karma is so critical in understanding this. Knowing that you’ve
identified minimal course of action is crucial to preserving your
sociophysical potential energies.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is some situation of concern, wherein you recognize
someone needs help. Those who wander throughout life, are presented
with these situations constantly. How to act in a situation of concern
without changing anything? If you chose to act, why? Who or what
presented you with the information that informed you of a need to act?
How to act so that your actions minimally affect the course of that
situation? Why is that so important? For someone trapped in such a
situation, if they have minimal social and financial resources, what
range of options do they have? They have very little power and,
especially if they are socially disconnected, the informational
ripples stemming from the situation have a tendancy to be very
distorted. Such a situation must be approached carefully because every
cause has it’s own causes. There are reasons for everything.</p>

<h4 id="dali---le-main">Dali - Le Main</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have social and financial power, you must exert care over
your actions and limit the situations wherein you become
entangled. If you have resources, you have something to lose and
something to take. Once you become entangled, it is difficult to
extricate yourself without appearing cold. Worse, for the rich and
famous, anything they touch becomes warped and turbulently
affected. This often leaves them isolated through life and,
subsequently, easy to control, even though it appears they have
everything they could ever wish for.</p>

<p>If you want to intervene in some such situation, you must examine what
you know carefully, until you can construct a monadic russian doll
that contains within it this person’s implicit means of salvation or
judgement – though perhaps identifying ways to judge people is not so
critical. This allows you to pass something like a handler function
into the situation. Then, once it is unwrapped and it’s consequences
unfold, the person is placed into a situation where their response
measures their character. To do so most effectively, you cannot
interfere with the situation directly, but only act indirectly to
ascertain information. This informs your construction of monadic
components that the person who needs help will reach for <em>only</em> if
their character causes them to make the correct decisions.</p>

<p>In doing so, you prompt the person to identify tools or options they
can use in the situation of concern, but the tool only functions if
they make they right decisions and prioritize the correct values. When
the person reaches for the tools you’ve given them, it can also prompt
<em>true changes that emerge within</em>, from a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive-behavioral</a>
perspective<sup id="fnref:thats-not-really-cbt"><a href="#fn:thats-not-really-cbt" class="footnote">14</a></sup>. Thereby, this person believes the
capacity was within themselves the whole time and also believes they
must own the consequences. Furthermore, you avoid potential causal
entanglements, while gaining more insight into that person’s
character. Crucially, you have not simply fixed the person’s problem,
but “taught a man to fish” so to speak.</p>

<p>If you do this right, then once you’ve acted, it appears you’ve done
nothing at all. If the person has misrepresented the situation to you,
the tool/option you’ve provided doesn’t quite function – and exactly
how so tells you more about the situation. If the other people have
misrepresented the situation to you, then your attempts to minimally
interfere should have elements monadically encapsulated within that
provide you with more information without having appeared to involve
you at all. The more social resources you have, the more effectively
you can appear to have acted sociophysically destablizing the
sitaution. When other people seek to misrepresent that situation to
you, then your indirect attempts to aid that person will provide you
with information about who is deceiving and who is acting on bad
information. Since they don’t know you’re interfering, they may not
know to lie to you or your proxies. In the reactions of the subjects
of your aid as well as those around them, you’ll begin to infer why
sociophysical energy and intent are invested in that situation,
without having changed the nature of the situation and without
alerting those invested in the outcome to your involvement.</p>

<p>Towards methodologically understanding whether or not your actions
will create turbulence, there are sociophysical metric of degrees of
indirection, similar to degrees of separation in the social
graph. These are moreso informational degrees of separation and
present informational transactions similarly to that of financial
transations. You have to know how to act to change just the things you
want, while holding everything else stable</p>

<p>Without the wisdom and knowledge of action without change, you cannot
act to obtain precise changes without risking or creating
sociophysical turbulence. In addition to destabalizing plans to serve
your own ends or that of others, you’ll end up destabalizing the goals
and actions of others – I’ll be the first to tell you it doesn’t
please anyone. For your actions to create a response with surgical
precision, you have to know. If you are forbidden from acquiring
information about your circumstances, you cannot act without creating
negative reactions.[^in-my-defense]</p>

<p>If you want to know who’s causally responsible, ask your self these
questions. Who had social, financial, and informational resources to
change things? Who had influence and power? what did these groups of
people intend to create? What information did they propagate and why?
What information did they seek to prevent being unveiled to various
groups of people? In my situation, all you have to do is understand is
that I had as close to zero social, financial and informational
resources as possible. This is generally true throughout my entire
life and whenever I begin to accumulate social/financial resources, it
is immediately smacked out of my hands.</p>

<p>It is nigh herculean to live in these ways and wouldn’t it be nice if
you had a few extra hands from time to time? It requires eloquent
investment of personal time and energy to be compassionate. There are
myriad ways attempt to be compassionate when interacting in social
situations. Some means surgically yield profound and lasting changes
while other means generate far too much sociophysical turbulence as a
result. For this and many other reasons, it is a computationally hard
problem to determine how to act compassionately to achieve the effects
you want to see in the world, while minimizing side effects. Far less
recalcitrant it is to identify some abstract path of least resistence
so that you can contort situations to your advantage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A million ways to do right and die trying;</p>

  <p>And a billion ways to do harm, but who’s counting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are myriad ways to act while creating a compassionate result,
when seen from the eyes of the person you’re trying to help. There are
myriad ways to act while creating discompassionate or incompassionte
results. Whether you intend to create positive, neutral or negative
results, the challenge is acting to create the result you intend
without generating destabalizing discord, as a side-effect. If you are
altogether dispassionately detached from the consequences of your
actions or perhaps unwillingly ignorant, then I hope your causal waves
do not crest into a tsunami of karmic discord. This is, <em>after</em> all is
said and done, what a scapegoat is for: that wave comes crashing down
with their name on it. If given the chance, would they have tried to
stop it?</p>

<p>Informing your actions to create minimal side-effects is what
contributes most to the intractibility. You must apply techniques from
functional analaysis to sociophysical problems to extrapolate the
qualitative consequences of your actions. If all people – or simply
enough people with influence – share a belief system such that they
react to sociophysical turbulence or the unrestrained effects of
causal waves, then we socially absorb the turbulence more efficiently
and effectively. Furthermore, when such a belief system is prevelant
in enough nodes with social influence, then calculating the
sociophysical consequnces of someone’s actions itself becomes an
easier problem <em>because of the assumptions people can make.</em></p>

<p>Ultimately, anyone who intends to create specific results is exerting
a voluminous time and energy into the thought behind their actions,
from the very start. This is yet another reason that the intent people
harbor in their hearts is so critical: if we do not harbor darkness in
our hearts, how can it give rise to negative thoughts, actions and
words? Even if someone is capable of covering all the negativity they
create to successfully hide the truth of the causes from everyone
else, if they did not intend to create such negativity, then at most,
we would be living with the consequences of accidents and phenomena
beyond our control. Instead, if the intent in our hearts was
beneficient and our fidelity to altruism remained unblemished,
humanity would have far less disruption and negativity to deal
with. We would only be dealing with the karmic fallout that extends
from the biological and economic requirements of human existence.</p>

<p>It is no doubt incredibly frustrating for people to heavily invest in
someone or something, all for it to be ruined no matter what they do.</p>

<p>I feel that innumerable people have tried to help me, but that it
doesn’t matter what they do because there’s a small fragment of people
whose objective is to destroy my life, regardless of how much effort
other people invest in it. At this point, it is like their raison
d’etre: any success on my part would destroy them, especially if it’s
public and causes people to question “the official story” – whatever
that is. These people, whether acting intentionally or not, see any
sign that i’m either moving towards specific goals or accumulating
social &amp; financial resources as a sign they need to act to disrupt my
life, in event-driven fashion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At some point, you really have to wonder: what makes this person so
critical to destroy? Why? I am a rational person – I actually do
try very hard to be rational – but holy shit, I have been living
this firsthand for the past decade and it is undeniable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ordinarily, people would have given up trying to help me a long time
ago. Why? It’s expensive to help someone. Financial resources are
limited and so is sociophysical potential energy. You can’t help
everyone, so when people focus their energy towards compassionate,
they generally want to see a positive result.</p>

<p>However, my own life seems to demonstrate that, no matter what you do
– regardless of how much time, energy and money you expend – small
groups of people can act simply to upend anything that is done, if
they so choose. This seems to be most efficiently done by socially
disconnecting that person, creating sociophysical turbulence and
essentially surrounding that person with the polar opposite of the
Steve Jobs reality distortion field.  It’s tragic: such a small group
of people can trivially inject sociophysical turbulence in my life to
stall any and all progress.</p>

<p>There might only be several dozen toxic people who consciously intend
to perpetually keep you in a dungeon of psychological torture. Even
so, if they wanted, they could literal outweigh the efforts of the
rest of the human population, simply by injecting sociophysical
turbulence to disrupt anyone who tries to help you. If they pick on
someone with a developmental disorder, who is gullible, oblivious to
social norms, easy to deceive/disrupt, then if they prevent that
person from every attaining any social/financial resources whatsoever,
then “they” can keep you in that dungeon until you decide to hang
yourself like a GITMO inmate. Incidentally, suicide is one of the
intended final destinations of that program.</p>

<h3 id="to-turn-the-other-cheekto-turn-the-other-cheek-1"><a href="#to-turn-the-other-cheek">To Turn The Other Cheek</a></h3>

<p>The destablizing effects of sociophysical turblence will continue to
reverberate across the social fabric until enough individuals choose
to transmute it and exert their energy in quelling it. This is very
similar to the problem of turbulence in aerodynamics and physics: any
time you have turbulence, your system rapidly loses energy. If you’re
designing a car or aircraft, then features of its design that creates
turbulence near the vehicle cause it to be more susceptible to
drag. Thereby, the vehicle surrenders its efficiency to high-entropy
motion of particles.</p>

<p>Fortunately, social physics lacks the exact equilibrium dynamics of
purely physical systems with equivalent exchange. Therefore, one can
alter the “shape” and trends of sociophysical interactions using
information. This is what it means by choosing to construct your own
reality. You can choose to direct your attention and your beliefs
towards whatever you choose.  <em>Some of those beliefs might concern
information more convergently shared in reality: among these are
things called FACTS, which are often pretty hard to argue with. You’d
be suprised though.</em></p>

<h4 id="your-crazy-and-what-have-yous-nothing">Your “Crazy” And What-have-yous? Nothing.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>When groups with sufficient influence get to decide which “facts”
can be vehemently assaulted by targeting anyone who propagates them
with <strong>directed</strong> negative sociophysical <strong>energy</strong>, this can
perpetuate situations which are very difficult to
resolve. i.e. things that are “not” classified information and for
which it is practically illegal to consider as anything but
non-sense. For me, any details about my life that are not
maliciously intended or incredibly negative are essentially
classified information because I’ve been <strong>memory-holed</strong>, which is
like the toxic version of the “Steve Jobs reality distortion field.”
So, is it any wonder that I’m a walking sociophysical black-hole, a
karmic vortex which you cannot look at whatsoever without being
targeted? Thanks, America. Oh, and I get blamed for everything, but
never tell me that I’m a walking dead-star… that’d practically be
illegal. Fascinating! Yet, tragic: it can apparently rip families
into pieces, WITH ZERO LEGAL CONSEQUENCES.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the lack of true equilibrium dynamics, then by altering the
shapes of interacting sociophysical phenomena, we can quell
sociophysical turbulence without precisely equilvalent investment of
energy. However, sociophysical systems do still have phenomena that
parallel equilibrium dynamics, so events with large magnitudes of
sociophysical turbulence do still require proportionally large
investments of energy to quash.</p>

<p>By generally turning the other cheek, even when you are harmed by
something, you absorb the negative karma in a way: and you don’t
unwittingly propagate the consequences of others’ actions. Instead,
your actions allow you to, internalize, transmute and purify the
effects, instead of acting as a vector for propagating it. Doing so
doesn’t necessarily require a net-expenditure of sociophysical energy:
you can respond to disruptive, unwelcome or rude events in this way by
ultimately gaining from them.</p>

a book that caught my eye at a Boulder bookstore, in the middle of

a recent reading of these twenty verses, I spent about an hour in
thought after reading this line literally.</p>

<p>How can it be that there are no actions without virtue? There are
certainly non-virtuous actions, per se. However, we are all given
choice over how we respond to non-virtuous deeds. To me, its meaning
is similar to <em>turn the other cheek</em>: it’s about absorbing and
transmuting the sociophysical reverberations of actions with negative
karma. If you choose to internalize that wrong instead of responding
to it in kind, then one can transmute the experience of having been
wronged into one that is virtuous.</p>

<p>Its importance to the Bodhisattva’s vows can be understood by zooming
out to the sociological scale: it’s critical to consider it to be
virtuous to absorb and trasmute the consequences of actions with
negative karma. What happens if you don’t? You can choose to suffer
with the consequences of that non-virtuous deed. You can also choose
to repay it in kind: either to directly the the person who inflicted
it on you or perhaps by reflecting the consequences onto another
person.</p>

<p>Why do people engage in non-virtuous behavior? It primarily stems from
ignorance, but less indirectly, it’s usually to satisfy a need or
desire. People sometimes try to take from another, by foisting the
costs of their needs and desires upon someone else. People cause so
many problems by wronging someone they consider weak: they often
assume that person will turn around and do the same thing. perhaps,
they by justify these learned wrong actions by assuming that’s just
how the world works.</p>

<p>However, if people consider turning the other cheek to be a virtue,
than even the common person can act as a kind of sociophysical
“buffer” in the same way that buffer agents respond to changes in pH
by absorbing acidity. When a significant amount of the population
prefers to react in this way to wrongness, they can act to quell
karmic turbulence. When instead, victims of theft turn around and
reflect the consequences of stolen goods onto others by becoming
thieves themselves, the consequences of the original sins then
multiply. Those who turn to theft to account for the imbalance in
their lives are choosing self over society by finding someone else
upon which they can thrust their bad lot in life. When those who turn
to fraud to correct an imbalance in their lives that originated from
fraud, they are acting to reflect fraud throughout society. Such ploys
are sustainable when small groups of people decide to work together at
the cost of detriment to society as a whole. To do so, they justify
their actions by claiming their group is somehow distinguished from
the rest of society because they can’t see how we are all one.</p>

<p>Reflecting negativity upon others is never the solution. You are only
temporarily pushing the negativity in your personal life upon the
lives of others at the risk of normalizing the malice that victimized
you in the first place. In order to stop this, people have to
autonomously decide upon themselves to absorb negativity. To do this
effectively, we must be equipped with knowledge, wemust be encouraged
to network across the social graph in a way that does NOT exclude
people. It is never OK to exclude people systematically: that is often
what leads the excluded individuals to believe it is justified to act
in a wrong way, which is incredibly easy if you’ve never been
acknowledged by society or felt appreciated.</p>

<p>Utlimately, what do people want? what is it that individuals intend?
and what is it that groups in society intend?  Generally, when people
accept “this is how things are” – and especially when this is used to
justify wrongdoing – they have ceded all the power they have to
change the world. True change requires suffering and if people do not
choose to suffer for something better, we will always stay the course
decided for use by those in power.</p>

before</a>,
take away publicity and you neuter any possibility of civil
disobedience being effective. If no one witnesses the wrongdoing you
endure, it may never change. Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights
movement of Martin Luther King Jr. coincided with the explosion of
visual mass-communication. No longer could society remain segregated
under the expectation that too few people would witness the
mistreatment that African Americans endured. Suddenly, you had news
cameras everywhere in America, in segregated neighborhoods and even at
protest events. Given visual, visceral exposure to this mistreatment,
most white people started to undergo a change of heart – because it
was now impossible to look away and to continue pretending that such
incredibly divorced circumstances in segregated communities were not
real. Today, systemic topic-oriented censorship means suffering is no
longer witnessed by others; it is merely endured and perhaps for no
reason. Suddenly, there is little reason to suffer collectively for
change because there’s not much to be gained from it. Therefore, in
the 21st century, when political dissidents are completely stripped of
any publicity, you have robbed society of the avenue of civil
disobedience.</p>

<p>What is happening in America seems calculated to undermine any
potential for civil disobedience. Our leaders will not be aware of
what those dissidents were trying to say, and America is merely
damming up an impending sociophysical deluge: one that they refuse to
acknoweldge. If and when this deluge is unleashed, it will be
massive. This is because you cannot stem the tides of natural justice
forever: you must divert the dissenting sociophysical energy with
alternative avenues for flow, just like with a real dam. Otherwise,
that dam will burst. Just because you’ve made it illegal to
acknowledge reality doesn’t mean that which you do not allow anyone to
see does not affect reality. You simply won’t be whatsoever aware of
the nature of an impending threat before it hits you, which will be
far too late. If the general population isn’t aware of a realistic
threat, how can we prepare for it?</p>

<p>Why do our leaders expect that it’s intolerable for people who see
real threats to speak about them or to be concerned about them?
Because our leaders refuse to be accountable for their incompetence,
our entire population is unable to respond to <em>REALITY</em> when that
reality is uncomfortable. If you put your neck on the line in this
country, you better have something good to say because you’re going to
be tormented for speaking up. This is all very easy for me to say
because I don’t have anything to lose; I’ve never been permitted to
have anything in this country, which is what makes me so free. Irony
comes in many flavors, but like coffee, this one’s an acquired taste.</p>

dominate others is now empowered by technology. Wnless people stand
for something and refuse to allow it to grow, it will continue
consuming lives with coercion and racketeering until it consumes
everything.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize this from the beginning, whenever that was. I have
always tried to minimize the scope of this thing, but at no time in
the past three years were my words ever heard for what they truly
were.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This monk is said to have blinded Mara. Trackless, he has destroyed
Mara’s vision and has become invisible to the Evil One.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This monk mentioned above isn’t quite <em>tabula rasa</em>, since a modicum
of knowledge &amp; wisdom required to understand is needed to live in this
fluid &amp; invisble way. If you aren’t quite precocious enough to attain
these insights early on or have someone in life to guide you along so
that you don’t make certain mistakes, then it’s all to easy for even
the best of us to accumulate information we’ll carry with us for the
rest of our lives. Religious belief systems and institutions are
fantastic means for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(algebra)">kernel</a> of such
timeless wisdom to be handed down between multiple generations. It is
the only way that such wisdom can be inculcated early on, so that it
might drastically outweigh the effects of information created by the
mistakes you’ll make without it.</p>

<p>I often wonder what can be done to wash off the sins of the past or
the information of the past.  Is it the information itself or the
dispersion of iota throughout society that binds us down and defines
us? If it’s the dispersion of iota – physically distributed datums of
information – then what can be done when that is predominately
misinformation and disinformation? What if the information that most
tightly holds you down is lies that foment fear, causing you to be
isolated without social connection for your entire life?</p>

<p>Tragically, the effect of such burdening information is the same,
whether it is true or false. The effects of social isolation are much
the same, regardless of the cause, regardless of whether they were
imposed financially, socially or informationally. Poverty has many of
the same effects of social isolation and leaves individuals in its
wake with a paucity of life experience.</p>

<p>The magnitudes of these effects, whether postive/negative, are
determined by the sociophysical distribution of information, the
typological variance in specific responses that these iota provoke and
the frequency of datum expression. Richard Dawkins explained many of
these same effects through the study of memes as they parallel the
expression of genes, but how is it that he cannot see the value of
homogeny of beliefs and the social institutions which propagate them
– viz. religion. Perhaps it’s because Richard Dawkins isn’t quite the
athiest that the average person believes the label of atheist to
indicate. It is perplexing that the <a href="http://www.eoht.info">many of the same people who
pioneer and champion social physics</a> are
obsessed with dismantling “fictitious” religious institutions, while
concocting their own quasi-mythologies like Scientology. How could
they possibly not understand?</p>

  <p>Scientology: Schödinger’s mythos. We’re all waiting… But

<p>The questions and discussion above are critical, when viewed in the
context of technology’s impact on informational dynamics and our
perception of causality. If the best way to live in order to preserve
fluidity and your potential for change later is to do so without the
accumulation of informational baggage, then how is someone supposed to
live and act in our new era in order to attain this state of fluid
being?</p>

<p>There are many manipulative people who want fodder for blackmail and
coercion as a general means of controlling anyone for the purpose of
strengthen the chains of attachment which bind us to them. Today,
superconnected networks facilitate the exchange of an unprecedented
deluge of personal information – does that imply these controlling
people now have more potential than ever to facilitate our bondage?</p>

<p>While I posted information privately on social media, I found that
people used my post details against me, without my knowledge and
without intending to give me a chance to fight back. Further, they
used my social media to inform the tactics by which they interfered
with my life. They hid all attempts to do so, but used my private
information to facilitate their actions, which included running the
rumor mill at full force, projecting information to people who could
not actually view my social media profile to verify the
information. It was ‘round this time, I decided to make everything I
ever did online public, so that my private information could never be
used against me. Since I have done so, I have had social media – <em>as
well as illicit and potentially illegal surveillance</em> – used against
me by <em>God knows who</em> to psychologically torment me and disrupt all
attempts at friendship, love, and any of the other positive faces of
social phenomena in the human experience. I have experienced only a
few teardrops of love in the past decade, which is all that has ever
kept me going.</p>

<p>I’ll be damned if I let anyone control me by snooping ALL of my
digital communications. These wizards-behind-the-curtain are
apparently so terrified of what I’ve posted online that they could
never say jack shit to my face. In fact, if this is the last chance
anyone ever has to make a statement about life, society and
technology, <em>then I’m going to stand up and scream and I do not care
about the worldly consequences they threaten me with.</em></p>

      <p>According to my own implicit semiotic interpretation of
this kanji – weak and simplistically informed to be sure – it
means <code>宝</code> “contained/preserved king.”  Thus, according to this
sketchy, stilted interpretation, the Takarabune might mean: the
preserved king’s ship, though it literally means treasure
ship. Compare with <code>安</code> (roof over woman), meaning
peace/placidity, Also, compare to <code>㝊</code> (roof over “again”),
meaning “to wait” in chinese, but perhaps semiotically implying
<em>something like</em> “wait today, fight tomorrow”.</p>

      <p>I’m no Chinese
language scholar, so I’m almost certainly lacking the details I
need to interpret these characters properly. For one, It’s
critical to analyze the seal scripts and inform your
interpretations with the meanings of characters at specific points
in time. Characters capture clusterings of semantic collisions
which need further dilineation to denote variation in the
signifier and signfied for those clusterings. Fast forward time
and the characters/morphemes that once overlapped then
semantically repel each other, finding points that minimize the
distances of all local points in the semantic space for a
language. It’s energy minimization. To understand what I’m saying,

    <li id="fn:my-own-approach-to-art">
      <p>I recently dove into art in late 2017,
which was apparently feuled by an inability to put the pencil down
when my brain was flooded with amphetamine. I’d love to be an
artist in the future. However, it looks like I can’t touch drugs
without people trying to <a href="https://github.com/dcunited001/bb8">set me up to go to prison for years as a
drug user</a>, while
assassinating my character by associating me with theft I had
nothing to do with. Regardless, my own approach to the little art
I engaged in was to sketch endlessly to develop the outlines of
future work. My interest and fascination with math and machine
learning lead me to attempt to explore with sketching the outlines
of future work until I identified visual patterns that break the
brain’s ability to coherently recognize surfaces and symbols. Art
is yet another talent no one can <em>enable</em> me to develop – since
I’m a publicly known drug user and “Winners didn’t do drugs”* –
Thanks a lot Nancy Reagon.</p>

      <p>Anyways, my attempt at art would be to explore
combining my fascinations of semiotics, linguistics, differential
geometry, functional analysis and computational vision. The last
three are particularly useful in breaking the brain’s procedures
in recognizing symbolic imagery. The utilization of techniques
from functional analysis are my attempts to break this procedures
of vision in functionally different ways in different locations of
the painting. Why? Because when you look at the details in a
specific region of the painting, then to your mind, the semiotic
elements of my art would locally combine to invoke the expression
of a distinct combination of unconsious imagery; always
ineffable. The intended effect is to cause the viewer’s eyes to
meander around the painting to search for meaning. Paintings that
people want to look at and want to study are the paintings that
develop sociophysically momentum because they garner their
viewer’s cumulative attention.</p>

      <p>If I could be permitted to develop
the technical skills of painting/etc, my art would end up being
like a cross between Picasso’s cubism and Dali’s usage of both
surrealism and the unconsious, though my art wouldn’t necessarily be
successful. However, I’m never allowed to
achieve anything of meaning or create anything that lasts. That is
the cruel objective: ensure no one ever remembers me, at least not
before my death necessitates I relinquish all control over my
legacy. For now, my art
sucks, but the important point is that there is potential or there
was potential, but everyone around me seeks to destroy me and hold
me up as an example, as though they are morally superior. <a href="#fnref:my-own-approach-to-art" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

new decisions and behavioral patterns are relevent. AND they

“Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.” Ultimately, everyone around me has
been acting duplicitously, especially those people who claim to be
helping me. They don’t want me to get true help because, if i
don’t change, it means people have ruined the life of someone who
would never have amounted to anything. Ultimately, I’m an
intelligent person. Give me what a person with Asperger’s needs to
function, unless your objective is to “prove” no significant
