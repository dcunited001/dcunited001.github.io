- egyptian architecture as the most prominently preserved ancient
  architecture, exerting an archetypical influence on our minds for
  millinea, even after language was lost.

- were the egyptian pyramids a response to a loss of cultural
  information? they seem to have attempted to build something so
  large, it would be impossible to tear down.
  - is their understanding of the afterlife simply the modern era?
    (not literally) however, it is like they wanted to make certain
    their cultural artifacts would be protected through time.

- Here (prior to printing press), the narrow spectrum of available
  info fluctuated perpetually.
  - rationalism wasn't even a fleeting dream at this point.
  - transition into brief reiteration on information economics before
    the printing press..

Prior to the press, all written records were copied manually.
Accumulation of writing was roughly bounded by the literate
population, a kind of abstract membrane whose size loosely correlated
to a population's permeability to written records. Copies more
numerous and accessible resulted in more frequently amplified
information. If the work wasn't financed by the church or state, the
information's time-to-live drastically plummeted, which parallel's the
IP Protocol's TTL value. If there were no written records, reflections
of the information only persisted if they were retransmitted faster
than they decayed. If supply increased and demand stayed high, ...

.. it would be retransmitted and was only remembered if it was
prioritized enough to establish consensus among the people. (rw)
  - in the dark ages, information deemed undesirable was often
    punished by death.

After the printing press, both the copies of information and the
frequency by which records were published increased by orders of
magnitude. Information consensus, at that point, was effectively
physical. In order to suppress information, it required the location
and destruction of all physical instantiations of the information. To
purge records with certainty meant locating them without raising
alarm.

### [Who Loves Hip Hop?](#who-loves-hip-hop)

- emphasize that the democratization of media creation tools, coupled
  with access to broadcast mass communication led to cultural
  transformation
  - 

*I do*. Hip Hop is a modern example of how the dissemination of
information changed the lives of millions of people living in mostly
African American and Hispanic ghettos in urban America.  In
particular, it is about the democratization of music production
hardware. It is the first time that *everyone* had access to all the
equipment needed to produce music, no crazy white man involved.

Hip Hop represents the equivalent of the Internet in terms of
democratization of technology in the music industry. It is the 20th
century's equivalent of the printing press. It is similar in how
economic and technological factors transformed social and cultural
conditions. This empowered millions of people and cutting out those
few who stood in the way since the birth of radio and mass media!

In the late 70's and early 80's, music production equipment was still
expensive, but it was the first time since the invention of radio that
someone could produce and record music by themselves. Along came the
Roland 808 Drum Machine and anyone could produce simple loops. Without
much other hardware, one could program a loop and rap over it.

No studio engineer. No musicians except the musicians. No pricey
studio hours. The songs could be created by individuals. If they could
get it on a tape, they could play it somewhere. If it was good, they
could then pay to have it mastered by a recording engineer. This
allowed urban musicians to experiment with new forms and there was
nobody above them that told them they couldn't make it or push it to
syndication on the radio waves. It was this change in the economics
and technology of music that paved the way for the cultural revolution
known as Hip Hop.

Def jam poetry evolved into MC's lyrical style. Block Party DJs like
‪‎Kool Herc‬ and ‪Africa Bambaataa‬ battled with innovative DJ styles and
collaborated to architect a cultural movement that simply couldn't be
stopped. Lyrics provided a lens into conditions and poverty in ethnic
urban communities which were otherwise lost and forgotten. Until this
radio explosion radio was tightly controlled and continued to be for
decades.

The cassette recorder & player was the next major advancement. It
meant anything with a headphone out or a tape interface could record a
mixtape that could be copied and shared with friends. No longer could
white, corporate types maintain a music industry cabal. Everyone who
could afford a Walkman or earlier incarnations of cassette tech could
make their own music.

Again, democratization of music production birthed a genre of music
giving a voice to those otherwise silenced for generations. And why?
Because it gave poor people a megaphone. Do you think the average
person would let specific practices continue if they really understood
the effects? No. So if you can share information, you can put a stop
to things!




### [What Created the Black Lives Matter Movement?](#what-created-the-black-lives-matter-movement)

(rewrite this section with a focus on how, not the existance of
information, but the ways in which we interact with it can have
expansive sociophysical consequences)

#### Digital Publication of Local Government Data

Why did Black Lives Matter arise in 2014, 2015, and 2016? It was the
democratization of government statistics required for data
science. Quite simply, before this time, most of that data had been
inaccessible. In the early 2010's and especially in late 2013, there
was a huge push to democratize data for all governments in the United
States and around the world. In the US, state and local governments
*digitized, released and publicized* records including arrest and
incarceration records.

It was this movement to digitize and publicize data that sowed the
seeds for the anger that ensued. It it was something that was
inevitable. This data would have inevitably become available. Some
people woul dhave been ready for it. This anger was well justified,
though I hope we funnel this into positive movement and come
together. The reason people were so angry is because they could
finally show that there was a lot of unconscious racism across
America.

*Furthermore, there were these pockets where institutionalized racism
was harbored.* These places were cities and districts where it was
*UNDENIABLE* that you had *conscious, instituationalized racism*,
where the local law enforcement was acting as "Sherrifs of Nottingham"
and intentionally enforcing laws in pursuit of suppression. These
places were few and far between IMO. Ferguson is such an example,
where the disparity is so pronounced it is undeniably conscious.

In subsequent entries in this series, I'll discuss how social media
newsfeed algorithms have vulnerabilities and flaws that increase
division in America. In particular, clustering algorithms and others
have runaway feedback loops that have a runaway affect that *DIVIDES
AMERICA*.  These algorithms are difficult to design, tweak and
validate in the first place, but there are major problems here, as far
as I can see.


# "Traits" of information

- need a better name to identify this category
- each of these traits affects how we share/preserve information and
  how we think about it (our behaviors in relation to it)
  - the spectrum of information that is preserved expands
    - eventually it contains elements which can't be removed
- innovations that affect these traits have radical qualitative
  effects on social interactions and the diffusion of information

### Permanence

- when information is almost always impermanent people operate with
  the assumption that the specifics of their actions will almost
  certainly be forgotten.

### "Provability"

- people's tendency to validate.
  - if it's not easy to validate, people wouldn't default to
    trying to validate information
  - beyond some threshold of efficiency/effectiveness of
    validating info, people start doing it all the time

### Permeability

- language and other barriers to the consumption of
  representations of information.

- this relates to the proficiency of information processing agents to
  consume information representations and parallels representability
  - we're evolving from a world where information was represented
    neurologically in infinitely many ways to one where there are
    universal representations of information that can be consumed by
    almost any information processing entity
- we had individually distinct neurological representations of
  information
  - then our social behaviors encouraged us to increasingly harmonize
    abstractions. this is what resulted in language AND forced us to
    expand our mind.
    - IMO, this is where man began to name the animals.
  - mankind harmonized its abstractions and as it did, language began
    to emerge. there are other aspects to this theory.
  - throughout history, we have spoken many different languages, which
    present boundaries
  - written language emerged
  - digitized information representations emerged
- if you take this concept to its limit, then information becomes
  increasingly permeable.

### Representability

- at first, the only information with physically manisfestations are
  written language, architecture (and..?)
  - more types of information become representable
    - we develop increasingly complicated means of abstraction,
      developing needs for new words/concepts

  - we also establish methods of preserving information
    - the written form of music composition

- then we have analog representations
  - by the end of the 19th century, we have photography and
    phonography to record sounds as they were. obviously, this has
    profound implications. people evolve similarly to how they did
    with permanence/provability

- we end with digitized (and/or some kind of fluid quantum
  representations of information)
  - digitized representations can be expanded to encode any
    information with varying degrees of parity

### "Trackability"

- the concept of a spime: an object that can be tracked in
  space/time for its lifetime
- provenence: data increasingly includes information about its
  source, its handling and its transformations
  - with provenance, you keep track of how data was transformed
    at various stages.
  - but also, it is related to copyright and licensing

### ??

- (something representing our ability to manipulate data with
  machine learning, in particular)

### Physicality (aphysicality)

the notion that more information becomes increasingly spaceless. its
representations can be tokenised, made more portable, and are mass
produced until exact copies of information are more numerous. then
eventually, all representations of information can be digitized,
copied at the click of a button and distributed anywhere.

- we haven't minimized physicality yet. this is more of an ideal that
  will never be fully reached.

### Temporality (atemporality)

- we haven't quite reached atemporality this yet.
  - eventually the accumulation of information includes an
    increasing range of what was produced in history
  - not only that, but our access to and accumulation of
    information begins to approach that of what is effectively
    what will be produced in history
    - so, the specifics of information might be different, but
      qualitatively, the range of information doesn't evolve much.
    - some information is purely metaphysical (laws of science,
      combinatorial enumerations of things, etc) this information is
      mostly not connected to time or space.
    - so we can generate more of it, it will always remain them
      same, we can access it from anywhere, etc.

- information economics and sociophysical aspects of information

  - elaborate on information economics (as distinct from economics of
    content...)


### The Economics of Content Production/Consumption Lead to Market Saturation

- (this has already been described in the first part, but needs more explanation)
- the economics of content production/consumption in a converging or
  converged world
  - this is where the [somewhat poorly organized] articles paradox of
    creativity and death of creativity are relevant

- [Paradox of Creativity](http://te.xel.io/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html)

here's an essay on the death of novelty and originality as the limits
on information diffusion are annihilated by the singularity. the
information overload, particularly its skewed nature, results in
generations of people who are completely severed from the past. if we
understand this moving forward, we can use social engineering to
preserve the pieces of our identity and culture which will otherwise
be completely lost.

### (Delineate b/w people, autonomous information-processing agents and instances of information)

- basically, in what forms can information be stored (quickly) and
  who/what can process it?
- autonomous agents and containers of information
  - how information moves, replicates and mutates
  - in the past, information could be totally restricted by physically
    restricting the vessel(s) of that information.
    - how this changes with a completely connected world where
      information can be freely reproduced at zero cost

### (Describe how (instances of information) are composed of references to imagery, signified by semiotics)

- the semiotics of information, content, media, art, culture,
  language, society, etc.
  - particularly, the distribution of information about symbols
    (signifiers) among people
  - moving forward into more connected societies, how brand
    recognition, content awareness, etc is fundamentally more
    difficult to create/maintain.
    - it is more expensive, possibly prohibitively expensive to market

###

- agents and vessels of information internalize representations &
  references to information
  - these references can be understood in many different dimensions
    - geographically: where does the information exist, physically? it
      matters
    - in aggregate: how many references are there to the information?
      - how is it distributed?
    - why is the information relevant to people?
  - how can these references be used in an event-driven manner as
    "hooks" for further reactions?
    - so, more widely distributed references provide a basis for
      imagery that provokes predictable reactions.
  - (analogy to the game of go/othello), where the references are
    eventually turned against you or against your adversary.

  - information is diffused primarily through communication networks:
    IRL, social media, etc.
    - can also be diffused through other representations, some of
      which are phsycial: billboard ads, street art, stickers, ...
    - recently, non-human agents like bots can be automated and
      controlled to influence people.
      - this is cheap, difficult to trace to a person
  - but more of our information is delivered through some virtual
    network built on top of the internet, often managed by a newsfeed
    algorithm

- these information representations are linked to abstract semiotic
  signs, which people interpret individually.
  - the democratization of content production along with diminshing
    economic opportunities will lead to overload of content
  - (move insights from below on how this creates unmarketable
    cultural noise that prevents semiotic interpretations from being
    created/managed)

- (the content overload mentioned above) makes it increasingly
  complicated to understand/predict how information will be
  interpreted.
  - further, the economics and inability to market information render
    it difficult for authorities or institutions to respond *to a
    culture that is evolving exponentially faster*
  - it's just important to see this coming, so that we can respond to
    it now with an understanding of what technocultural turbulence
    will be like before we encounter it.


###

- for example, in the 50's when there were three TV channels,
  - (1) how efficiently could we deliver a message to the american
    people?
  - (2) how confidently could we be that they recognized the language of
    symbols used in that communication in some predictable way?
  - for the first issue, there are answers that have already been
    implemented. there are SMS notification services for emergencies.
    - however, i'm not worried about instantaneous notification in an
      emergency.
    - () how can any group leverage communication channels for general
      purposes *in a predictable way* when there are exponentially
      many channels, many of which are algorithmically controlled
      - machine learning algorithms can't be indexed
    - the exponential expansion and variety of channels (in the purest
      sense of the word) create a situation where it becomes difficult
      or prohibitively expensive to inform and relate to the general
      public
  - that takes care of the first question above, which is trivial to
    anticipate. the second issue is much more complicated. through
    communication and consumption of information, individuals in
    society create their own understanding of how symbols, called
    signifiers in semiotics, map to the concepts they signify.
    - if you want to predict how an individual or group will respond
      to messaging, you need to know how they interpret the language
      you use to convey your ideas.
      - some of this language is textual or verbal
      - much of it, particularly the strongest signaling, uses
        language that trigger associations with imagery.
        - it's harder for people to understand these associations
          because sometimes they are subconscious.
    - effective communications leverages this language of symbols that
      are inculcated through a common, shared experience. that's what
      allows marketers to be confident they will provoke a strong,
      emotional reaction.
      - but if you take away the homogeny of symbols, it's difficult
        to predict how usage of these ad hoc languages of imagery will
        affect recipients.
        - in marketing, you want to nudge the recipient along a
          decision tree by leveraging associations that make your
          product pitch more appealing or even relevant. you might
          also use vivid imagery to create a strong first impression
          of your brand.
        - in public relations, when trying to unify a country full of
          people fighting over issues provoked by foreign influence,
          is it easier or harder for institutions to appeal to
          citizens to react uniformly? no, it's exponentially more
          complicated because the influence any one channel can
          project is limited AND the language of imagery has been
          diluted.
      - without prediction and quantification, one can't ... public
        relations strategies makes it difficult to design...

### (inculcation of a langauge of imagery)

- constant inculcation of a fairly homogenous set of primary symbols,
  that are recognized almost universally across the culture
  - e.g. freedom, liberty, the declaration of independence, etc in
    America.
  - e.g. Star Wars, Harry Potter and other super-IP's that are
    recognized almost universally
  - these cultural symbols can signify different associations to many
    different people, but they are distinct from less widely diffused
    symbols in that:
    - they are universally recognized among a culture
    - they have a cohesive, mostly homogenous set of meanings as a
      basis.
    - crucially, there is an assumption that almost everyone in a
      society can communicate with these symbols, both with words and
      by provoking imagery
      - i.e. the difference between using a (basic) reference to tv show
        Star Trek and using a complicated spock versus lizard-man
        reference
        - the first can be interpreted by almost everyone in America
          and, even if they don't understand your specific meaning
          using Star Trek (just the TV show) as a reference, they can
          anticipate what most people would
      - again, the difference is that there are symbols that have
        diffused with consistency such that almost everyone can expect
        other people to identify common signified concepts
        - then there are those, where not only will few people
          recognize the symbol, if they do, signified interpretations
          can not be anticipated with much degree of certainty without
          additional information layered in to clarify
    - there are about 100 cultural universals shared by humanity.
      these are a completely different subject, but most of them
      function as symbols people recognize that can be used as
      imagery.
      - but there are symbols shared amoung groups, societies and
        cultures that are virtually universal within those groups.

- the point i'm trying to make is that when the economics of content
  creation/distribution/consumption are disrupted as they almost
  certainly will be, this phenomenon of the creation and maintainence
  of a language of shared imagery slows to a trickle. those widely
  diffused symbols with cohesive, signified interpretations that can
  be conveyed with confidence simply do not reach the level of
  distribution in society for them to be considered universal.
  - while this may seem trivial or abstract, it may pose unanticipated
    communication difficulties for many cultures and nations.
    - so, for example, if you needed a strong set of images to provoke
      a patriotic sense of duty among your citizens, but you don't
      have an education system, then you likely haven't deployed that
      language of imagery and associations among your citizens.
      - therefore, in this situation, predicting how messaging to your
        citizens will affect how they react is almost impossible.
    - America won't deal with problems as severe as not having an
      education system, but we are a long ways away from a system of
      three TV channels, where it is trivial to know what information
      people have consumed and how they interpret messaging.
      - that is not to say that we should artificially limit channels
        of communication

- this is a warning that foreign adversaries now have unparalleled
  reach into our nation to slowly build out their own languages of
  imagery or subvert ours to exert more influence over citizens, to
  constrain narratives and to
  - so, how does their capacity to mutate the more logical aspects of
    human communication (semiotics, imagery, association) change when
    America's capacity to cultivate these primary elements of
    communication is greatly diminished?
    - it means that, as cultural artifacts become indistinguishable
      and innumerable while recognition/relevance of those artifacts
      is some minimal amount of people, it affects human language and
      communcation in a profound way by shifting beneath our feet the
      mechanics, proficiency and predictability of utilizing language
      layered with imagery.
- while it is hard to quantify whether this phenomena will actually be
  exhibited to a relevant degree, it is also important to note that
  this happens very early for America and the West and happens much
  later for most of the rest of the world.
  - this means that leaders who signal over communication networks
    hoping to call their citizens to action will be less able to
    clearly convey a message that delivers on creating a predictable
    emotional response.

### example: progression of meme culture in the 2010's

  - how has the uniformity in meaning changed for individual memes?
  - how has the predictability of a signified concept changed amoung
    meme recipients.
  - how has the proliferation of meme's changed?
    - do new memes spread slow or fast? do old meme's die young in
      2017?
  - is it easier or harder to create a new meme that catches on and
    takes the world by storm, making you an unlikely and unwilling
    celebrity?
    - it doesn't fucking happen does it? that was really fast. all of
      five fucking years, but these are meme's ... who tf cares?
  - meme's are not very important. they are cheap to make and
    ephemeral, but most meme-like images shared on FB/Twitter today
    are almost unique. it is less likely to see new memes pick up wild
    momentum, though it does happen (i'd argue it is because we need
    these nearly-universally recognizable symbols and so we
    arbitrarily skyrocket the usage of almost random images because
    they tightly map to some facet of life we all need to communcate.

#### example: conspiracy theories

- another example: the recent explosion of conspiracies, most of which
  are young, incomprehensible and fake. (not necessarily "fake news")
  - in particular, i'm talking about the youtube conspiracy
    documentaries that you see.
    - people made an hour-long youtube documentary

#### political example: wtf is the deep state?

- this is an example of an imagery being mapped inconsistently (partly
  bc of spectral decoherence)
  - should this occur earlier?
  - perfect example of imagery that is being remapped so that it
    doesn't cohere to any dominant interpretation
  - while it seems that conservatives have one definition and liberals have
    another, the c...

#### another example: fake news.

  - fake news is what it is, but it layers into our culture pattern
    languages (and sets off these viral outbreaks of...)
  - it is not necessarily bad, but fake news is an effective tactic of
    information warfare that layers down exactly what the fuck i am
    talking about above that flies over the head of most people.
    - it creates these languages of imagery where those symbols are
      laid down and propagated through our culture.
    - later on, content can reference those symbols to trigger
      confusion or distraction.
  - most people won't understand the way i state my ideas above, but
    they do understand the confusion of fake news, which btw, i'm not
    sure how to define. are we talking about cosmo pizza and
    pedophiles?
    - regardless of the quirkly, distracting stories, i do not have
      confidence in our media today at all. liberal media is pushing
      toxic narratives that



# Vulnerabilities

- (@@@@@@)
  - what could be exploited?
    - amplification of information may spiral out of control (or be
      controlled via AI and thus inaccessible)
    - information economics: scarce information becomes rare
    - major network outages result in intensely inverted circumstances
      - e.g. information economics are suddenly inverted for millions
        of people who may have otherwise never experienced pre
        21st-century life

    - distributed attempts to influence newsfeed rankings (this could
      be incidental or part of an attack) result in isolation
      - goals could be to isolate groups or specific users by
        proactively running content and encouraging everyone to react
        to it, then manipulating IRL, social media and alogirthm
        response
        - this might create isolated subnetworks of users (but i don't
          know enought about FB newsfeed)
        - can FB ever know that, for one user, they are receiving a
          representative experience of the FB platform via the
          algorithms? how do they score this?
        - for more info on, clip from draft:
          from-the-parapets-of-alexandria.md (part 4)
        - encouraging people you influence to downrank posts/pages/etc
          from specific people, so that their rank gets dinged
          - this is not so different from rallying people on a page to
            troll someone
            - coordinated harassment appears to happen on social
              media, though what i've seen is fairly light

  - other things that can go wrong, but not exploited per se
    - artificial amplification of information crowds out real signals.
      - since being proactive with content, signaling, helps structure
        it so that it provides better insights to marketers (etc.)
      - artificial dampening of signals has a similar effect
        - if/when some topic is censored, this affects other tools
          that are built on top of tech (i.e. NSA surveillance, which
          *could* miss signals if censorship artificiall dampens them)
        - or it's presentation on social media is tailored via
          newsfeed algorithms that turn down the volume on unfavorable
          presentations of that info
    - adversarialy structured interactions can feed into themselves
      (like automated trading bots)

    - adversarialy structured information produces hard-to-predict
      consequences in algorithms
      - if you want to dampen a topic, you can structure news reports
        which are similar and compete for search ranking for current
        results
      - so, there is some semantic overlap that causes algorithms to
        not function properly

  - long-term dynamics:
    - "censorship's effect on cultural development" from parapets-part-2
      - in this context, i'd rather stay away from "censorship" at
        least in name
      - how does the supply and variety of information in a region
        affect its development?
    - similarly, prolonged isolation's effect on cultural/economic
      development in a nation.
      - so if a nation is much less connected to the rest of the
        world,

  - how to make these things better?
    - (1) more emphasis on strong notions of identity
      - above and beyond just "verified users get slight increase in
        ranking"
    - (2) network analysis on pages/accounts with similarity in
      access/management patterns
      - there has to be a human somewhere and humans can only do one
        thing at one time.
      - if pages/groups are being accessed by the same accounts froma
        myriad of IP addresses or geolocations, that's suspect. (these
        things are already done)
      - tighter restraints on some API interactions
        - most of these things suck for the common internet "power
          user" today
     - (3) newsfeed algorithms should make decisions that are
       orthogonal or anti-parallel to the optimal decisions
       - that is, they should make the wrong decisions sometimes, but
         they shouldn't be too horribly wrong
       - newsfeed should also try to harmonize it's results.
         - see draft: parapets-4
     - (4) newsfeed should maybe be more interactive to get more
       confident readings on what you want to see at that moment. like
       choose-your-own-adventure newsfeed
       - yes, you can have friend lists, or smart feeds, etc. that's
         not what i mean.
       - this is just a high-level pipe-dream idea, but if you change
         the infinite scrolling to something that "scroll" into
         multiple topic directions
         - so it's still as simple as scrolling down infinitely, but
           the UI action subtly presents choice

# Anticipating Information Warfare

- understanding everything thus far and reacting to the situation
  early, in anticipation of information warfare

### why is all warfare essentially information warfare?

### what is usually meant by information warfare?

    - competition over information and its distribution to influence
      the behavior of groups
      - these groups can be larger scale: social, political, military
      - and smaller scale: units of troops or insurgents, individuals
        suspected of espionage, departments in a corporation
      - typically, the more surgical the targeting, the less
        information is created as a result.
    - the definition of "information warfare" blurs with ideas from
      PR, communications, marketing and branding, which are
      essentially objective competition over information and its
      distribution
      - but if used in a military sense, often implies achieving some
        tactically or strategically relevant change in behavior by
        creating, distorting, diffusing, etc. information
    - information warfare is distinct from other forms of war in many
      different ways, including that information can be created and is
      much more difficult to destroy.
      - in economic warfare, you're competing over resources,
        opportunities and relationships which are exchanged
      - in armed conflict, you and your adversary have more clearly
        defined resources which can be created, moved, destroyed, etc.
        - these resources, at least at a higher level, are more
          clearly defined and quantified.
      - also, it's important to distinguish that these resources can
        be clearly added/removed from the conflict, whereas
        information is everywhere and is created as a result of
        changes in the environment, the action of people or autonomous
        agents, etc.
        - it's something that is created everywhere by everything, but
          isn't so easily destroyed.
        - information may be more fundamental to the universe than
          matter. it is thought to be preserved by black holes, etc.
        - but information has a life of its own and is difficult to to
          restrict its diffusion without either coercing the container
          of information or destroying it entirely

  - some examples of tactics in information warfare
    - most techniques from marketing or branding
    - restricting diffusion of information, generally or from specific
      groups of people
    - manipulating the presentation of information

### when is information warfare advantageous?

    - when the adversary is strong:
      - they are more capable of pushing a large volume of information
        (information flux)
      - they are more likely to be perceived as credible
      - they can react quickly and powerfully in the short term
      - they can be more confident about the permanence of their
        long-term narratives
      - because their information is dominant, people default to
        usually comparing other information to the default worldview
    - when the adversary is weak:
      - they can influence the strong, without overt warfare, and
        promote narratives counter to short & long-term objectives of
        their enemies
      - this is particularly effective in the long-term when they can
        establish information/narratives to be used later on that, at
        the time, don't seem threatening or the adversary's goal is
        not obvious
        - when the weak adversary gains strength, the information they
          pushed subversively can become more useful.
    - when the boundaries of a country's communication networks are
      porous and highly connected this is both an advantage and
      disadvantage

# boundaries of communication networks in information warfare

- when the social network boundaries are more tightly locked down:
      - there are negative aspects:
        - it becomes harder to establish relationships with the
          outside
        - your population's understanding of the world becomes skewed
          and it is very easy to make long-term strategic blunders
          - the everyday people and the leadership are detached from
            reality and unware of trends and options.
        - economically and politically, you are at an incredible
          disadvantage.
          - it is typically harder to engage in free trade without
            restrictions or government regulation
          - it's easier for trade partners to discover
            products/relationships in societies that are not closed

      - there are benefits in the long-term:
        - because your adversaries or other neutral players have not
          been able to diffuse information into your society with much
          proficiency, the logical copies of information within the
          minds of your population are fewer in number and much weaker
          in proportion to alternative information
          - so, therefore, it's easier to suppress information you
            don't like because *it never took root at all*
          - also, you just never have to deal with it. information
            contrary to the mainstream almost doesn't exist.
          - many countries seem to prefer this because they don't want
            information they can't control to disrupt or dilute their
            culture, which is something that many Westerners don't
            understand or even find offensive.
            - these countries may be trying to protect their cultural
              identity in the long-term. if they open their doors with
              no restrictions, then foreigners with more money and
              power will control what information becomes dominant.

      - IMO, these few benefits are grossly outweighed by the lost
          economic opportunities. these are things that mostly benefit
          people in power in those countries, but also can be an
          attempt to preserve cultural identity in spite of
          modernization


- language boundaries
  - the nodes in the the social graph can be grouped by languages,
    which are each connected by a bilingual set of the population that
    can act as a membrane by which information can easily pass into
    the other language groups
  - this only effects irl/p2p conversations, but today most
    information is refracted across multiple languages


- narrative of american interventionalist foreign policy as being
  evil, self-serving and (etc..)
  - by the way, i don't believe this narrative and find it to be
    offensive. policy and politics are never simple, especially when
    it comes to conflict. the same action can be interpreted in many
    ways, this narrative is ludicrous and toxic. America stands up for
    human rights, civil rights and justice in the world. America uses
    our power responsibly for the greater good and we do so to defend
    freedom, justice and economic development around the world.
  - A dominant force that doesn't wisely and justly exercise its power
    will inevitably destabalize itself. in the later 20th century, we
    were lucky to have America as a superpower willing to stand up
    because Soviet Communism was destined to require an empire to
    sustain itself economically.

  - the adoption of this narrative by radicals could lead to
    exploitation via information warfare. in the short-term, it has
    disrupted our response in the beginning of the War on Terror
    - it demoralized the public and prevented us from acting in unison
      to support our military.
    - it resulted in a political swing to the left b/w 2004-2008

  - in the long-term, (if america were to cede its superpower status,)
    this narrative may become dominant. a dominant power could use
    narrative like a page in a coloring book to paint the united
    states foreign policy as evil
    - (as a dominant power), they would be able to build on top of this
      and distort it however they want to keep us in check.
    - if the narrative wasn't a defining component of so many
      citizens' worldviews, then our enemies wouldn't have the
      opportunity to build on top of it in the future.
      - i personally don't believe the narrative at all and think the
        opposite, with maybe a few exceptions, is true. america is a
        force for good in the world.

- ... or wasn't a primary factor empassioning liberals to encourage
  demoralization

- american (vulnerability) - which one would you want to be?
  - a broken down beater, unlocked with nothing in it
  - a mercedez with the windows rolled down four inches. it has a
    state of the art security system, but lined with luxury's like a
    handicapped claw game
  - a bulletproof limo with tinted windows, SCIF certified, secure
    VOIP and a convoy


###

- (originally after the section on information flux in ancient times)
- in modern times, we've gotten used to instantaneous communication
  via the internet
  - but when telecom networks are disrupted, people will be caught off
    guard by the change
  - in modern warfare, this has been a tactic for armed conflict in
    developed nations.
  - however, the contrast between a state that has adapted to the
    possibilities enabled by wide internet penetration and the state
    that suddenly has none is stark.
    - this means that there is suddenly no social media, no news and
      no mass communication.
    - here, whoever controls any communication infrastructure, at
      first, has an advantage.
      - while there is complete chaos, people will be eager for any
        information and there will be little capacity to dominate the
        narrative via sheer quantity of information
    - whoever can reestablish network infrastructure first wins.
      - however, if your technology is destroyed via EMP, every
        circuit is fried. the smaller and more fragile, the more
        certain it will be affected. everything including compact
        disks and magnetic tape will be destroyed.
    - whoever has emergency response or military assets that are
      hardened can immediately respond.
      - much of america's hardware has been hardened against EMP, but
        such an attack will result in chaos.
  - but the point is, without that information infrastructure, we
    revert to sociophysical communication methods.
    - this is a nightmare scenario for the american military, so you
      can bet they have thought this out.
    - this sets up a situation where people are vulnerable to
      misinformation while they are desperate for information to
      explain their circumstances, their options, etc.

- not all societies have strong (internet participation rates)
  - so people in developed societies misunderstand conflicts in these
    areas.
    - "the war is for your mind"
    - in order to subdue an enemy, you have to convince them that you
      can overpower them or, if you are not their enemy, per se, you
      still have to leverage communication networks to convey this
      - example: fighting the taliban in afganistan
  - but if the war is for their mind and it's up to us to establish
    ourselves not as invaders, but as liberators, then communication
    is incredibly challenging when the networking infrastructure is
    not there.
