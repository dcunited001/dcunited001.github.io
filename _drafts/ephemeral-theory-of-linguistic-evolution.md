Basically, there are these transcendant metaphysical constructs that
act as linguistic "leylines", to which such ephemeral pre-linguistic
communication groups would be encouraged to adhere.

These leylines would drive early morpheme selection and their
epimemetic viability. These leylines would dictate the
psycholinguistic attributes of phonemes by altering their situational
& functional relevance to the early human condition.

These metaphysical leylines are basically the mappings b/w a social
groups set of phonemes/morphemes and the collective consciousness and
collective unconsiousness.  That is, there were some types/metatypes
of messages that we were destined to need to be relayed as
communication b/w early humanity.

These types/metatypes as basis for communication include: shelter,
hot, cold, food, hunger(a kind of meta-type: anticipation of food),
water, thirst(again, a kind of metatype), fire, danger, unknown,
novelty, awareness, mate, love, fear, life, death, sickness,
singularity, plurality, unity, togetherness, similarity, fire, injury,
type of injury, need, want, hierarchy, possession of a need/want of
another, generalized acknowledgement. These needs/desires are so
universal, they are shared with many animals to a varying of
overlap. Animals can easily communicate such concepts.

Furthermore, there is no skill which furthers the development of one's
mind as much as the development of vocal expression. So this ephemeral
theory of prehistoric linguistic-evolution isn't just relevant to
explaining the roots/viability/selection of early phonemes/morphemes,
it is also very relevant to the development of consciousness. In this
theory lay the roots of humanity's development of intentional
abstraction via assignment/distribution of signs/signified/signifiers
(a la semiotics). There is no pre-historic *psycho-phenomena* or
*socio-phenomena* that accelerates the speciation of consciousness to
the degree that vocal phoneme delineation and morpheme selection does.

- (reorganize the following argument)
- that is, in and of itself, the biological evolution of the capacity
  for vocal dilineation of phoneme's leads to a revolution in
  consciousness.
  - this is because of how that specific, evolutionary biological
    feature meshes with the nature of neural networks.
  - these neural networks must satisfy a range of functionality
    encompassing proficiency in at 7 or more attributes:
    - interdependency,
    - flexibility,
    - redundancy,
    - specialization,
    - clusterability,
    - categorizability,
    - stability (resillience of input/output behavior)
  - these attributes are provided to varying degree by the
    presence/absence of genetically encoded proteins/behavior and
    epigenetically expressed behavior patterns
- therefore, three(?) factors contribute to this revolution in consciousness:
  - the genetically-encoded capacity and development of a sufficent
    number and quality of synapses.
    - the genetic presence and development of potential for neural
      abstraction
  - the genetically-encoded capacity for vocal dilineation and
    interpretation of phonemes
    - that is, it's physically possible for a species to make a range
      of sounds (or non-acoustic signifiers!
    - and it's physically possible for a species to interpret a range
      of phonemes and the qualities of their expression
    - for each phoneme or sound, those qualities for both
      expression/interpretation include:
      - degree of root pitch vs change in pitch
      - degree of initial FFT spectra of sound vs change in spectra
      - degree of initial volume \
      - degree of rhythm/repetition of pitch, spectra,
      - degree of control over expression of that specific
        sound/phoneme.
  - the genetic and neural capacity to:
    - distinguish self from actors in one's environment
      - this is measured neurally by dissonance in
  - the neural capacity to internalize, cluster/categorize and
    recognize aspects of that species' experiences in its environment
    - which includes the HARDWARE! ability
    - degree of a type of sound's relevance to self for a species
        - this requires some notion of self (at least on a
          subconscious level)
        - this requires that an individual of a species is capable of
          enumerating, recognizing and internalizing knowledge related
          to the kinds of experiences which are common for its species
          - and, to some degree, others in its environemtn
          - THIS DOES NOT IMPLY that the animal cognizes these things,
            just that, on a hardware level, its neural networks
      - the degree of relevance to internal/external context and
        meta-context
        - this is a bit more difficult to explain
  - the consistency by which


varying a phoneme/morpheme's
degree of geographic/social distribution or specific functional
utility in the collective consciousness of early humanity

would even dictate the functional

### Misc Linguistic Ideas:

- what does the difference b/w zipf's distribution for english words &
  japanese loan words from english tell us?
  - japanese loan words are always written in katakana, so they are
    easily distinguished between loanwords by people inside and
    outside of the culture
    - also, this would tend to lessen external influence to some
      aspects of the japenese language
  - this also works for other languages, but it's harder to delineate
    evolution of internal and external aspects of the language

- (?) Linguistic properties and characteristics that contribute to
  psychology, qualities of communication, social phenomena and culture

- linguistic analysis of english literature compared w/ accent.
  Evolution of lexicon evolution, compared with zipf profiles

- search for coupled evolution of morphemes in languages
  - there's a tree of coupled morphemes (this is how we can recognize
    a possible proto-indo-european language)
  - search for coupled evolution of morphemes and stabalization of
    homonyms and partial/full word phonetic collisions
    - this will "crack the code" .... LMFAO
      - it's inevitable that this code will be discovered and it may
        be known that it is inevitable
    - also search for evidence of an accent's influence on the lexicon
- etymological connections between synonyms and homonyms

- morphomemetic symmetry: correlating morphemes and semantics in
  linguistic evolution discover symmetries
  - that is, for many languages, what are the central, most basic,
    semantic concepts *defined first* and what common
    patterns/symmetries/categories emerge when analyzing language in
    isolation?
    - and what patterns begin to emerge in pairs/groups of languages?

- (hmmm i should have some more ideas for data science on
  language. it's just a damn shame that my life has been ruined (was
  attempted to be ruined?) to make me an example)

- what do unused latin chars do on a JP keyboard?
  - like on the hiragana/katakana keyboard
    - this is pretty easy to answer actually, they mostly do nothing
      - but the purpose of this question is trying to figure out what
        those keys could do
  - what are the alt-gr keys on russian keyboards?

### Chinese/Japanese

- to determine the meanings behind radicals and
  [placements](https://kanjialive.com/214-traditional-kanji-radicals/),
  find common placements b/w kanji (see a & b)
  - that is, try to find common placements (there's a name for kanji
    placements) where the same kanji is modified with:
    - same placement, but using a different radical
      - e.g. 一（ひとつ: one） is modified using placement A with 水
        (みず: water) or 人（ひと: person) but both are modified using
        a single kind of placement (kanmuri, ashi, etc)
    - or different placement, where the same kanji is modified by the
      same radical
  - with this analysis, there should emerge some interesting patterns,
    based purely on the graphical relationships in placement
    - the placement types themselves should "mean" something, of which
      i haven't been able to find much information on the internet

```
A: かんむり (kanmuri)

|=======|
|  top  |
|-------|
|       |
|=======|

B: あし (ashi)

|=======|
|   |   |
| L |   |
|   |   |
|=======|
```

- there should be another interesting layer that shows up in both
  chinese, japanese and korean, where there is a pattern of phonetic
  "collisions" that overlays the writing systems of each spoken
  language
  - however, because these languages share the same writing system,
    the mapping that is overlaid on top of said writing system is
    unique for each language (and time period)
  - most of the information here will be purely incidental, but there
    should be some deeper significance discoverable from the homonyms
    and other "phonetic collisions" in each language
  - for an example, see below:

```
去る ＋ 皿 → 盍
sa(ru) + sara → ??? !@#$ it, i forget
```

- i forget, but at the time i saw this, there seemed to be a deeper
  connection here. it had something to do with "covering" ...
  - but the verb is essentially transformed via radical into a rarely
    used verb meaning the opposite of the original
  - i can't remember how i came across this anyways.
  - but it should be possible to develop an automated means of
    discovering "collisions" like this (most of which are purely
    incidental)

[去: to leave or go away](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8E%BB#Japanese)
[皿: plate/dish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9A%BF)
[盍: cover, come together, congregate, meet](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9B%8D)
[盍(jisho): cover, meet](http://jisho.org/search/%E7%9B%8D%20%23kanji)

- also, there's the graphic equivalent of a synonym that's only really
  found in traditional chinese. there are thousands of rarely used
  characters whose meanings differ only slightly from commonly used
  characters

# Study of Linguistics, Anatomy and Evolution

The ability to use language seems to drive evolution towards
intelligence by contributing towards the runaway development of
certain mental, physical and behavioral changes. The evolutionary
contributions from Voice & Language can be zero'd out by other
factors, like genetic capacity for sufficient neurological
developments or the size/shape of the skull and parts of the brain,

- todo: there's probably a name for this subfield of linguistics
  (anatomy, genetics & linguistics)

### Concept of critical mass, as applied to anatomy/linguistics

there should be some set of features and quantifyable attributes that,
in the presence of sufficient genetic & neurological & social
conditions, should further the development of the mind through
consistent capability for overlapping sounds. These features,
qualities and quantifiable attributes must have some minimum critical
mass of each:

- most importantly: the consistency of conserved phonemes available to
  & stable between generations.
  - phonetic possibilities in the context of anatomy is where the
    concept of critical mass: what are the vowel/consonant phoneme
    combinations available/practical for
  - more important: these anatomic features must have a high degree of
    species penetration and quality consistency and evolutionary
    stability (breeds/etc)
    - these factors, if not consistent to almost all members of a
      species will act as multiplicative factors that can zero out the
      possibility of adoption of language.
- consistency/frequency of vocal usage amoung species members
- social & environmental apsects (see below)

- consider the speciation of the anatomic qualities giving rise to
  particular phonemes.
  - which phonemes are guaranteed to be "locked in"
- can the anato-linguistic characteristics of specific species be
  identified?
  - compare with a measure of recorded sounds to construct a map
    dilineating the typology of sounds, 1-grams, 2-grams and n-grams
  - compute the possibilities of unrealized phonemes per a species
    anatomy.
  - compute prospective anaotomical changes with respect to
    combinations of features altered via genetic mutation

- at what point are the genetic aspects of phonemes preserved?
  - wouldn't this occur once a species needs to use the phoneme for
    conveying a particular idea?
  - applying the inverse of occam's razor, wouldn't the phonemes with
    the least number of dependencies be the most preservable?
    - then wouldn't these be the first to achieve the socio-genetic
      dynamic described above?

- if an existing species is hybridized or genetically
  engineered to produce an anatomy with a larger, more consistent
  enumeration of phonemes, will this spark a evolutionary revolution
  in the minds of members of this species?
  - if so, parrots seem like a counterpoint to this idea

- rats of nimh...

# social aspects

these aspects of a species will lead to the optimization of:
- the frequency of verbal communication
- language penetration
- phonetic consistency
- consistence life experience

these specific aspects are desirable:
- consistent stable environment
  - relationships with predator/prey
  - does voice/audio/sound reinforce survival?
- fairly social intra-species usage,
- sufficient population density,
- "desirable" species behaviors
- longer generation cycle and more simultaneous living generations
- lower number of children per family & generation
- longer time spent raising children

### Possible Methods of Experimentation


### relationship between volume & information processing capacity of matter

- is there some minimum brain size required for intelligent life that
  dictates the minimum scale of organic, intelligent life?
  - it would be related to the general information processing capacity


# Ante Modernism

- the idea of "ante-modernism" as the period just before, during and
  after the initial noological explosion.
  - this parallels the idea of modernism as the beginning of the
    possibility of modernism
  - 'noological explosion' => this refers to genetic, anatomic,
    neurologic and cultural development during and following the
    initial sociolinguistic 'explosion'
    - (1) the genetic and neurological requirements are met for pacing
      neurological evolution with the added capacity required by
      language and abstraction. so, as the mind needs more petaflops,
      evolution can genetically keep up
      - paradox: this is sudden exponential neurological development
        where the species can and will hit genetic bottlenecks.
    - (2) the social and behavioral requirements are met: the species
      has social interactions with consistency and regularity.
      - paradox: (???)
    - (3) and the environmental dependencies are met: there is a
      consistent but high-variety environment guarenteed for dozens or
      hundreds of generations.
      - consistent: major disasters do not threaten stability, nor
        does the species way of life change dramatically
      - variety: the species is confronted with a high variety of
        regular types of situations that it must adapt to.
      - paradox: consistent-yet-varied. the variety is, mostly,
        symbolically important to qualitative facets of the species
        life experience.
- this "ante-modernism" is like the beginning to what may culminate in
  modernism. without this initial period, nothing else would follow.
  - it is a very special period of time in a species development.
    there are requirements that are mind-boggling for nature to
    satisfy, as well as a delicate, but shifting balance required to
    foster further development.
  - "ante-modernism" should be defined as the period of time during
    which a species develops language and abstraction.
    - (what is the difference b/w language and abstraction?)
    - this must almost certainly occur when there is genetic stability
      in the anatomic form used for communication and one guarentees a
      consistent set of anatomically-enabled phonemes.
      - evolutionarily, this is what leads to language and is the only
        way that I can imagine the mind and brain of a species to
        become sufficiently "abstractable" for further development
      - however, life arises in unexpected places and so this stage of
        evolution could emerge in unexpected ways.
      - but this is why i would i would define it as above

- during this period, noologic evolution begins and neurological
  development accelerates as ideas that exist solely within our mental
  confines begin manifest effects on the physical world (viz.a.viz)
  the action of autonomous conscious agents.
  - information representations were still important *before* this
    period of time, ... (how to distinguish?)
  - beginning during this period of time, internalized representations
    of information now include abstractions and map between
    abstractions.
  - distinctively, it is the first time when a member of a species
    reconciles their internal representations of information with that
    of other members.
    - there is this kind of homogenization and convergence of the
      metaphysical that results from the possibility of high-bandwidth
      communication.
    - (i may need to qualify this distinction in a better way) there
      are other species which abstract aspects of their interactions
      with each other and exchange abstracted
      information. (e.g. honeybees dance)
      - so how do i specify that a particular level of
        abstraction/communication/etc qualifies the ante-modernist
        species to be considered as different?

- bc of the need/ability to communicate phonetically,
  - the mind develops abstractions that require consensus to be
    meaningful
  - in more detail, this possibility forces the mind to:
    - combinate through known ideas, to create purely abstract ideas
      (like 'what', 'nowhere', 'nothing'),
    - and to combinatorially parse verbal communication both
      symbolically (phoneme combinations/inflection, grammar) and
      expressively (tone, volume)
  - but all abstracted communication requires consensus to be useful or meaningful
    - it is that need for consensus and reconcillation amongst
      individuals in the species that makes this kind of abstraction
      of the mind fundamentally different.
    - whereas other species exhibit social behavior and limited
      abstraction of some information, they don't need their
      abstracted model to
      - in other words, they can abstract things, but don't need to
        reason about how others abstract the same things or different
        things.
      - to leverage language as a tool, one needs a minimum level of
        consensus about grammar, syntax, semiotics and vocabulary
        - none of these concepts exist solely inside any single
          individual's mind. (HEGELIAN DIALECTIC)
          - i.e. i can make up a language that only i know, but how
            would someone distinguish that from gibberish (or purely
            random verbal data)
          - and if there is a world with a single person that speaks
            one language and no one else, is that a language? (thought
            experiment)
        - so, therefore, one requires a degree of consensus in
          abstractions amongst members of a species before
          communication can be effective, efficient or predictable
          (i.e. before communication actually conveys an evolutionary
          advantage)

- this idea of a socialized abstraction (w/ consensus) is distinct in
  quality from the other kinds of cognitive abstraction that arise in
  animals.

### Three Hard Problems That Language Forces Brain To Neurologically Solve

- These are all purely abstract problems, where before a species
  evolves higher-order communication, any cognitive abstraction in
  nature is extremely rare.
  - Further, they are hard problems, particularly the combinatorial
    reflection required to generate consensus.

- (1) combinatorial expansion of phonemes into morphemes
- (2) interpretation of grammar/syntax
  - initially, there is zero or minimal grammar or syntax
- (3) combinatorial reflection comparing individual abstractions with
  the same abstraction amoung various groupings of individuals
  - these reflections of an idea/abstraction must be reconciled to
    form a consensus in the mind of the individual.

# Implicit Signaling Via Deviation from Norm

- TODO: correct in-band and out-of-band in this section:
  - in-band: vocal/grammatical signaling
  - out-of-band: signaling via reference to cultural norms or allusion.

- this applies to both language and to signaling via behavior.

- So, to discuss how "psycholinguistic" structure affects the
  intricacies of communication, I'll refer primarily english and
  japanense.
  - I'll refer to native english speakers learning japanese and native
    japanese speakers learning english, compared to the same for English
    and European languages.

- Specifically, I'm interested in the ways groups can leverage
  psycholinguistic structure to signal within themselves to convey
  information to other people inside and outside the group.
  - individuals can leverage the facets of structure from their
    language or from a specific pairing of langauges
  - grammatical and syntactic rules can be leveraged with semantic
    expectations, psychosocial associations and normative assumptions
    to braid various interpretation to other participants in the group
    - while those signals remain to contextually coherent.

- there are lots of ways to do this and you see this emerge in social
  group interactions all the time.
  - It happens anywhere people want to be polite and tactful while
    conveying different pieces of information to different individuals
    or subgroups.
  - In other words, it happens in any social situation where there is
    information asymmetry -- and there is always information assymetry.

- That there is informational assymetry in every real social
  interaction is almost axiomatic to understanding social
  interactions.
  - One can imagine virtualized social situations where idealized
    participants can have all access to all information such that the
    context for each participant is necessarily
    - But even then, there is still informational assymetry in how the
      participants process different pieces of information at
      different times.
    - Unless the idealized participants all share the same set of
      state information and process or access it uniformly, then there
      is always some information assymetry.

- Why is this so important? Because, in (all?) social situations,
  people are always trying to sustain, promote, curtail, provoke or
  eliminate information assymmetry.
  - They almost always do so generally to analyze how their current
    local social setting impacts their short-term and long-term
    well-being.
  - They do so incidentally to achieve some intention or objective.
    - By compelling their social interactions to cohere towards the
      attainment of some specific goal or unknown desire, they act to
      win a social "game" and in pursuit of advantage, they filter
      their signaling to prevent information diffusion.
    - This manipulation of info-dissonance arises indirectly from the
      desire of participants to "win" some interaction where the
      presence of information affects the outcome.
  - They can limit diffusion to expediently coordinate group behavior
    around some specific objective.
    - This is distinguished from the previous in that the social
      "game" overtly requires limiting information, at least for some
      strategies or tactics to be viable.
  - They can methodically limit info-diffusion as a kind of policy, at
    an individual level or as part of a group.
    - The assumption here is that optimal advantage is always coupled
      to minimal or maximal information diffusion.
    - examples include:
      - politicians defaulting to never disclose more info
      - military doctrine defaulting to never supply info unless needed
      - the usually sociopathic tendency to never disclose information
        in order to retain advantage or personal control in a
        relationship.
        - in the future, at their discretion, they can selectively
          propagate information, that forces a group of people to
          reevaluate the context of the situation
        - essentially, it provokes a convolution of context. and if
          you *always* prefer to withhold information as a rule, then
          you maximize your potential to change how something is
          understood later (viz. force a convolution of context)

- Generally, people tend to parameterize their selection of behavior
  or objectives with the distribution of information assymetry and its
  aggregate degree in mind.
  - so, even an unwilling, apathetic or detached social participant
    will consider their understanding of whether their understanding
    of a situation is complete before enumerating or selecting
    behavior to consciously execute.
  - corollary: someone who believes their understanding of a situation
    either is or will be complete will be less likely to select
    behavior to mitigate information assymetry
  - This information about the availability, distribution, convergence
    and utility of information is higher up the "flow chart" for a
    person's decision making process.
    - while you can't simplify a person's decision-making process to a
      flow chart, since it is non-deterministic...
      - if you could visualize the dependency graph a person's
        cognitive processes, sub/consciously reasoning about
        information availability informs and requires lower-level
        cognitive processes.
    - (while it's difficult to state what I'm trying to say
      succinctly), the way the mind reasons about epi-information and
      meta-information almost causes more changes in cognitive
      functionality than the specific information itself.

- What is are the distinguishing attributes of meta-information
  and epi-information here?
  - information is any assertable proposition
    - referencing nodes of information sourced from the graph of all
      information
    - composed into a tree of propositions that is
      assertable/queryable in various ways
    - can be true/false/unknown/etc/etc...
      - what base boolean values (true/false/null/undefined?)
      - what boolean traits? (true/known/knowable/available/etc.)
  - meta-information
    - information about the information contained within or "adjacent
      to" the information.
    - this includes inferences made between the information itself and
      the information it references in its tree of propositions
  - epi-information
    - information about the information that isn't reconstructable,
      given the information itself.
      - aggregates involving the information
      - information about the social distribution of the information

- Within this definition of meta and epi:
  - the statement "NSA collects metadata on communications" would be
    correct in its usage of meta if its talking about data about data
    in the call logs (inbound and outbound numbers, call duration,
    etc.)
  - however, if instead of asking "what phone numbers did X person
    dial", we ask "which people dialed Y phone number?" ...
    - then, this piece of information is epi-data.
    - it is data, usually aggregate, that is reconstructable given the
      set of data it requires as input.
    - because the epidata can not be reconstructed from itself, it is
      not metadata.
  - sidetrek: would distinguishing b/w data, "metadata" and "epidata"
    force a legal reevaluation of the presumed distinction b/w data
    and metadata?
  - using this definition:
    - there are metadata that are identical to pieces of epidata 
      - (i think ... examples?)
    - there is metadata about epidata
    - there is epidata about metadata

- Individuals and groups can systematically devise overt, covert and
  subversive signaling protocols.
  - this is interesting because it implies information assymetry in
    not just 'what' we communicate, but in 'how' we communicate as
    well.
    - More simply, some people know ways of communicating or signaling
      that other people aren't aware of at all.

- one can always signal by deviation from established psychosocial
  norms.
  - These can be linguistic norms centered around grammer and
    semantics.
  - Or they can be established sociocultural norms, in terms of rules
    for behavior.

- the requirements to leverage *any* norm for out-out-band signaling:
  - (1) the presence of the norm
    - is it real, definable
  - (2) awareness of the norm
    - are you and those you are signaling aware of it
  - (3) an understanding of how one can deviate from the norm
    - and how to translate that action as a signifier to decode it
    into something that is signified

- that's really all that's required to signal out-of-band by deviating
  from any norm.
  - It's not that useful until you can bundle signals together that
    will be interpreted differently by social participants or
    subgroup.
  - here, you are bundling messages with various interpretations as a
    single statement or action to be signaled to varying effects
    amoungst the group, so to utilize it:
    - (minimally) => you have to know at what threshold of
      norm-deviation will cause a participant or subgroup to cognize
      the norm's deviation
      - this is sufficient for "boolean" signalling
    - (expressively) => you have to know how deviating from a norm
      causes the action or statement to be interpreted in a number of
      ways

- both languages with more structure have more norms to deviate from
  - and, similarly, cultures with more traditions/etc have more norms
    to deviate from.
  - also, it follows that groups of people who strongly adhere to
    customs, traditions or linguistic structure can signal amongst
    themselves in ways than those outside the group.
    - more importantly, the members of this group can form
      *expectations* about how to signal out-of-band without needing
      to communicate beforehand to explain what will be mapped to
      what, etc.
    - that is, by being a member of a group with a strong identity
      where the members of the group have shared a strong common
      experience, you can signal and expect to signal amoungst the
      group by using norms, allusions, traditions, etc.

- Every language and culture has layers of structure.
  - There are lots of different kinds of composite structure, so they
    are difficult to compare.
  - However, in aggregate, languages can be compared and said to have
    more or less structure.
    - One must specify some metric for a pair of languages that judges
      each type of structure and the ways in which each type can be
      composed with other facets of the language.

- Cultures that have languages with "more" structure in some ways
  change the way people interact, in social interactions and
  interpersonal relationships.
  - Another way to compare two languages is by measuring the effort
    required or complexity in assymilating into the culture.
    - That is, generally, languages with "more" structure requires
      people to learn more details and reinforce more habits when
      learning the language.

### Signaling with Japanese Counter words

- japanese has different kinds of counters for different kinds of
  things. (list examples... books, 'tsu' for generic things, flat
  things for bread/pictures/paper)
  - it's generally a norm that you should use the proper counter (if
    you know it) but it's easy to use the wrong one or only the common
    one (tsu) if you don't know it
  - so, as an example of out-of-band signaling:
    - say there are three japanese natives are in a sushi bar with
      three english people who have various levels of japaense fluency.
    - everyone is seated at the same table.
    - then, because it's a norm to use the right counter words and one
      can expect that it will make little difference to the
      non-natives, then one can break the norm to signal.

- but if someone used an incorrect counter word, what would it
  mean?
  - this is what is hard to discern for most rules or norms.
  - as noted above, there is the minimal boolean assertion of
    whether the linguistic or cultural norm was adhered to
  - there is also some flexibility here where rules can be broken
    in specific ways to signal specific things.

# How do languages accumulate structure?

- By structure, I mean things like the words used Japanese as counters
  for various kinds of objects. This kind of linguistic structure
  strongly affects how people will communicate when they interact.

- I don't mean to carry linguistic structure over into covering
  expanding a language's vocabulary unless it does so in such a way
  that is expansive and is fundamentally different than simply having
  more morphemes.
  - e.g. a society adopts a new technology or set of ideas that
    requries expanding language.
    - in general, tech requires expanding language to distinguish a
      multitude of ideas, most of which are not useful to most of
      the population
    - most languages never had words for most of the ideas
      introduced by technology, etc

### Ways Language can accumulate structure

- (1) co-evolutionary dynamics
  - these are difficult to measure or understand.
  - langauges may adopt grammatical or syntactic features of other
    local languages
- (2) self-evolutionary dynamics
  - e.g. speakers of a language may change the frequency by which they
    use a morpheme if it is highly similar to another frequently used
    morpheme. This happens all the time, like when you are encouraged
    to write sentences in English without reusing the same word-stems.
- (3) sociocultural influences
  - geopolitical or social influences on the environment of the
    speakers changes, which eventually results in changes in the
    language.
    - e.g. French people conquer Britain, now English people need to
      adapt to using French
- (4) sociocognitive dynamics
  - that is, in using the language, it triggers changes in patterns of
    thought in the users who speak it.
  - these dynamics have a stronger evolutionary effect in a
    multi-lingual society
  - people who are bi-lingual in a mono-lingual or multi-lingual
    society have qualitatively different cognition.
    - these effects are distinctive from the self-evolutionary
      dynamics
- (5) as a result of strong, top-down institutional forces
  - e.g. languages change by decree, changes grammatical rules,
    changes rules of etiquette, or enforces the usage of an entirely
    different language
- (6) languages also may accumulate structure from an attempt to
  influence linguistic evolution to produce specific kinds of
  structure which can be used advantageously


- this last one (#6) is what I want to focus on. i believe people
  realize that language is malleable and they understand it's utility.
  - they regularly utilize norm deviation to signal disparately to
    subgroups in social situations.
  - because new cultural traditions and new linguistic structures
    offer tools to leverage competition in social environments, those
    spontaneous combinations of language, grammer, tradition, etc that
    were deemed to be successful or advantageous are repeated.

- there's a paradox that arises:
  - the norms have to be propagated socially before they are useful
  - and to be useful for disparate signaling, not every one can know,
    so the indirect signaling method can't be disseminated in the clear
    - i.e. these aren't things that are written down and, by
      necessity, they are not.
  - so, the paradox is that, to use norms to signal, you have to
    propagate the norm
