#### Distance Metrics in Information Networks

> The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.

- Inequalities (contained-within & within-is-contained) in type-space
  - esp. as applied to game theory for real-time, stochastic &
    inschematic games
  - connections to nash equilibrium (when does the equilibrium exist
    and for which games is it unreachable/incomputable?)


- TODO: use Graph-Theory version of Gauss-Bonnet (from Oliver Knill's
  paper) to provide an example of a potential basis for
  information-geometry and information-physics (essentially,
  metaphysics)
  - this isn't perfect but the structures in the paper did provide me
    an excellent basis for conceptualizing "information geometry" and
    "information physics" where before I was simply thinking
    "incomprehensibly vast, self-similar graph-like things"
  - mostly G/B's definition of 2D graphs -- expanded to some
    dimensionality or abstract notion thereof that is ideal for
    metaphysics
    - is this related to E8 somehow?
      - E8 is what it is because it is the *only* lattice solution as
        "root" or as "pure" as it is -- for any dimension except 24,
        where there is one that essentially parallel's E8's ability to
        provide a great deal of flexibility in integral/algebraic
        number systems
      - so ... yes ... perhaps?
  - the lattice/graph structures (and domains) defined in the G/B
    paper by Oliver Knill are closer to ideal (from an
    interconnectedness or flexibility perspective) when the networks
    of sphere-graphs on the graph interlink -- essentially
    overlapping)
  - if you want to model all information *perfectly*, there should
    be some *simplicial* self-similar structure related to the
    structure of lattices like E8, where its degrees of recursive
    self-similarity form *the(?)* basis for:
    - ... something foundational without a doubt
    - Universal Algebra(?)
    - Leibniz's Charicteristica Universalis

- almost all the concepts reviewed in the first page or two of oliver
  knill's paper about combinatorial hopf algebra's also seem very
  relevant
  - enumeration of primary simplicial complexes "indexed" to some
    intermeshing lattice structure that interrelates all simplicial
    complexes (probably through a ??? Hopf something, lulz)
    - this probably drills into the "chromatic" concepts that are
      mentioned (if they provide metrics overtop spectral
      understandings of graphs... i really have no idea)
  - the point is, there must be structures that interrelate all
    possible structures, as well as algebraic represenations of them
    and all the possibles ways to mutate b/w them or intermesh them
    - this all must -- or maybe *should* -- hook into some kind of
      lattice or something, where everything becomes
      accessible/interelatable as part of the fabric of the same
      shared spaces

- how to relate this stuff to holonic representations of
  information-forms?

- (*THIS* is precisely why i'm so interested in papers like these)
  - if there is some certain structure for modeling the metaphysical
    -- which results in gradual/sudden consequences dependent on
    factors such as immediate/eventual computability -- then how
    does that impact how the singularity unfolds?
    - particularly, how does it impact how people adapt culture and
      society to the conclusions here? (especially if it might mean
      that subjectivity is immediately/gradually rendered irrelevant)
  - one such change involves expanding/contracting cultural artifacts
    to either inflate/deflate the amount/structure of information
    related to human life (to )

[^neutral-nets-in-sequence-space]: [Biophysics of protein evolution and evolutionary protein biophysics](http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/100/20140419.figures-only) (2014)

![Many overlapping neutral nets in sequence space]()

![Two overlapping neutral nets and their final conformations]()

- in the second pic above, the adjacent sequence variants are
  functionally coupled to similarly shaped final products
- holonic structures also have similarly overlapping regions
  - variants of datums (and their higher-type genericized memes) that
    produce holonic information "particles" could be imagined as
    "genes" or sequences.
    - this idea is not new. Dawkins and many others pioneered this
      philosophy of evolutionary dynamics of information (The Selfish
      Gene)
    - however, other metaphors can help us imagine networks and trees
      in "sequence space" based on metrics between ideas and memes
      - most of these problems are intractible, but this provides
        tools for dilineating and speciating information to identify
        that with evolutionary advantages or idiosyncratic functional
        behavior
  - i still can't actually "visualize" this. for protein folding, the
    above pictures have been dimensionally flattened.
    - how can mathematical structures capture all the information in
      the above metaphors and others?
      - what are simplified mathematic models that balance diminishing
        returnes:
        - simplified versions provide enough utility to produce models
          with computable data -- but how are the limitations of the
          models functionally coupled to the results the models
          produce?

- [Allen's Rule]()
  - if information itself is territory, how does this influence the
    evolutionary mechanics of information?
  - if social hierarchies are territory, how does this influence
    evolutionary mechanics in sociophysical phenomena or in people
    occupying social hierarchies

- how dead sea scrolls revived information that had been dead for
  almost two millinea, transforming the information landscape
  - explain how this relates to geomtery/mechanics of information
  - this is an example of tail-risk in information warfare ()

- egyptian architecture as the most prominently preserved ancient
  architecture, exerting an archetypical influence on our minds for
  millinea, even after language was lost.
  - lead in with this example of how the permanence of geom/mechanics
    of information ...
    - maybe refer to 'speculative history of humanity' outline, where
      i describe how monolithic architecture was a response to
      information loss from cataclysm and human conflict

- were the egyptian pyramids a response to a loss of cultural
  information? they seem to have attempted to build something so
  large, it would be impossible to tear down.
  - is their understanding of the afterlife simply the modern era?
    (not literally) however, it is like they wanted to make certain
    their cultural artifacts would be protected through time.

- emphasize that the democratization of media creation tools, coupled
  with access to broadcast mass communication led to cultural
  transformation

- the utility of information to people as a resource
  - why is information important to people?
    - because it contains some amount of truth, sometimes larger or
      smaller when compared to the size/scope of the datum
    - but it is that truth that is what people care about. that bit of
      truth makes the information valuable
      - if you are constantly living in disinformation, everything
        seems to become false and you become detached from any truth
      - whoever has power can create what will be perceived as truth,
        but everyone else must become subservient and hope that they
        understand the truth in the information being pushed to them
        - so, for the sake power, the powerful can seek to create this
          disinformation to distance themself from the common person's
          understanding. this can be justified bc some
          information/truth can be dangerous.
        - ...
  - information with a minimal amount of truth, maximal disinformation

- information as territory in information warfare
  - history is written by the victors, which is an example of being
    able to declare information as territory by pushing it out to
    networks of people, who shape their reality around it.
  - you want that history, that truth or that knowledge that they
    shape their reality around to be:
    - (...)
  - but in the 21st century, as the rate of information exchange
    accelerates & society converges around information, then
    establishing the proper narratives for your nation/culture/history
    become increasingly important.
    - in the latter 20th century, war became increasingly difficult to
      fight. the largest powers, the US and Russia held each other
      back through deterrence.
      - as the networks of mass media hardware were built out for
        people to consume more information in increasingly vivid
        detail, (...)
    - with some potential exceptions, this trend will continue, where
      deterrence encourages conflict to shift from military means to
      economic and informational means.
      - so, the narratives established become everything
        - again, barring some potential exceptions...
      - however, if you can't have total control over the diffusion of
        narratives, beliefs and information (i.e. if you can't totally
        destroy the information you don't like) then you should want
        to build on top of a positive story.

# Information Physics

- information physics: does it merit its own "thing" ?
  - social physics overlaps heavily with information physics
    - but i find myself using the phrase "information mechanics and
      dynamics" countless times
  - information physics isn't identical to social physics. it's not
    mathematical physics. however, "information physics" is only
    really meaningful when there is physical/logical variation in the
    distribution of information. if all information exists everywhere
    (i.e. an illusion of separation dissolves) then everything exists
    within an all-encompassing totality of information. there would be
    no distinction b/w one agent's set of knowledge and another's.
    - in this case, the information system, if it evolves, would do so
      in fundamentally different ways than when there is separation
      and variations in the physical/logical distribution of
      information.
    - we are moving towards such a system, but will never, ever reach
      it. looking at bounds on computer science (that result from
      Ramsey Theory and complexity limits of networking) is such a
      system that lacks variation in distribution of agency and
      autonomy ever even possible, even theoretically? Analogously,
      DOES INFINITY EXIST?
      - and if such a system does not (theoretically) exist, then how
        can we move towards such a non-existant idea?
  - information "movement" or deformation/displacement/kinematics --
    thus, physics -- is almost meaningless w/o a social context, even
    if one or all of the parties are autonomous/etc.

### Kantian Categories And Information Diffusion

- explain kantian categories using analogy of a magician's show

#### Watching Someone Watch TV

-

#### Betting/Bookies Example

- five people place bets on two separate sporting events
  - for the first event, all five people meet a single bookie, where
    they discuss how to handle changes to their bets based on the
    result of the first event.
  - they agree to change their bets on the second event based on the
    results of the first event.
    - the goal is to spread the losses and winnings among the
      individuals.
    - for the 2nd event, each person has their own bookie, but they
      have already discussed all the possible scenarios in the (game
      tree) that describes the possible moves that can be made.
  - the objective however, is not to win money, but to spread the
    losses and winnings optimally *without communicating* until the
    five gamblers settle their debts after the 2nd game.

- this is a scenario where information is ....
  - lambda calculus, prestructuring composition of categories
  - the lambda-calc-like structure must cover all the possible
    variations that the (kantian category representing the could
    collapse into

### Partitioned Communication Networks

- simplifying conceptualization of social physics by observing voice
  communication in video games.
  - in overwatch & other FPS you can't hear the other team signaling,
    but if they leverage team communication well, they can anticipate
    your movements in a way that doesn't expose information to you
  - sign language and pattern language provide a basis for
    communication that is similar to this. the people around you won't
    pick up on it, unless they are trained to do so. if they do pick
    up on languages like this and they aren't supposed to, this alerts
    the illuminati police.

- fog-of-war in overwatch communication
  - especially the rate of expiration of types of information
    vs. bandwidth as an immediately expendible, allocatable commodity


### Mechanics and Dynamics Semiolinguistic Games in Social Physics

- dissonance that emerges when adversarial networks try to signal
  using the same semiotic signifiers w/ different pattern languages
  (see draft on ephemeral nature of language to understand adversarial
  design of language and signaling)
  - [Antifragile Communications paper]())


### Metrics on Graphs of Information and Knowledge

- how this can correspond to a measure of intelligence: your ability
  to identify "longer" and more distant pathways for inferences
  - the types of "inference" pathways are more varied and less typical

- intelligence as the ability to identify/follow/etc longer paths
  through information networks/graphs
  - most people would find these longer paths and complicated graph
    structures too difficult to follow or (become confident of)
  - i have this written somewhere else in drafts, but it makes sense
    in this section

- from these metrics on graphs/networks of information/knowledge,
  measures of speed, certainty, etc can be developed
  - here, time can be defined literally or the number of cycles some
    entity might require to make the inferences or connections

# The Informational Physics of Cultural Movements


- if sociophysical systems are probabilistic and, thus,
  non-deterministic, can the perpetuation of information (written or
  otherwise) be guarenteed?
  - what level of information is required?
  - how could such a thing be guaranteed in a probabilistic system?


Hip Hop is a modern example of how the dissemination of information
changed the lives of millions of people living in mostly African
American and Hispanic ghettos in urban America. In particular, it is
about the democratization of music production hardware. It is the
first time that *everyone* had access to all the equipment needed to
produce music, no crazy white man involved.

Hip Hop represents the equivalent of the Internet in terms of
democratization of technology in the music industry. It is the 20th
century's equivalent of the printing press. It is similar in how
economic and technological factors transformed social and cultural
conditions. This empowered millions of people and cutting out those
few who stood in the way since the birth of radio and mass media!

In the late 70's and early 80's, music production equipment was still
expensive, but it was the first time since the invention of radio that
someone could produce and record music by themselves. Along came the
Roland 808 Drum Machine and anyone could produce simple loops. Without
much other hardware, one could program a loop and rap over it.

No studio engineer. No musicians except the musicians. No pricey
studio hours. The songs could be created by individuals. If they could
get it on a tape, they could play it somewhere. If it was good, they
could then pay to have it mastered by a recording engineer. This
allowed urban musicians to experiment with new forms and there was
nobody above them that told them they couldn't make it or push it to
syndication on the radio waves. It was this change in the economics
and technology of music that paved the way for the cultural revolution
known as Hip Hop.

Def jam poetry evolved into MC's lyrical style. Block Party DJs like
‪‎Kool Herc‬ and ‪Africa Bambaataa‬ battled with innovative DJ styles and
collaborated to architect a cultural movement that simply couldn't be
stopped. Lyrics provided a lens into conditions and poverty in ethnic
urban communities which were otherwise lost and forgotten. Until this
radio explosion radio was tightly controlled and continued to be for
decades.

The cassette recorder & player was the next major advancement. It
meant anything with a headphone out or a tape interface could record a
mixtape that could be copied and shared with friends. No longer could
white, corporate types maintain a music industry cabal. Everyone who
could afford a Walkman or earlier incarnations of cassette tech could
make their own music.

Again, democratization of music production birthed a genre of music
giving a voice to those otherwise silenced for generations. And why?
Because it gave poor people a megaphone. Do you think the average
person would let specific practices continue if they really understood
the effects? No. So if you can share information, you can put a stop
to things!




### [What Created the Black Lives Matter Movement?](#what-created-the-black-lives-matter-movement)

(rewrite this section with a focus on how, not the existance of
information, but the ways in which we interact with it can have
expansive sociophysical consequences)

#### Digital Publication of Local Government Data

Why did Black Lives Matter arise in 2014, 2015, and 2016? It was the
democratization of government statistics required for data
science. Quite simply, before this time, most of that data had been
inaccessible. In the early 2010's and especially in late 2013, there
was a huge push to democratize data for all governments in the United
States and around the world. In the US, state and local governments
*digitized, released and publicized* records including arrest and
incarceration records.

It was this movement to digitize and publicize data that sowed the
seeds for the anger that ensued. It it was something that was
inevitable. This data would have inevitably become available. Some
people woul dhave been ready for it. This anger was well justified,
though I hope we funnel this into positive movement and come
together. The reason people were so angry is because they could
finally show that there was a lot of unconscious racism across
America.

*Furthermore, there were these pockets where institutionalized racism
was harbored.* These places were cities and districts where it was
*UNDENIABLE* that you had *conscious, instituationalized racism*,
where the local law enforcement was acting as "Sherrifs of Nottingham"
and intentionally enforcing laws in pursuit of suppression. These
places were few and far between IMO. Ferguson is such an example,
where the disparity is so pronounced it is undeniably conscious.

In subsequent entries in this series, I'll discuss how social media
newsfeed algorithms have vulnerabilities and flaws that increase
division in America. In particular, clustering algorithms and others
have runaway feedback loops that have a runaway affect that *DIVIDES
AMERICA*. These algorithms are difficult to design, tweak and validate
in the first place, but there are major problems here, as far as I can
see.



# "Traits" of information

- need a better name to identify this category
- each of these traits affects how we share/preserve information and
  how we think about it (our behaviors in relation to it)
  - the spectrum of information that is preserved expands
    - eventually it contains elements which can't be removed
- innovations that affect these traits have radical qualitative
  effects on social interactions and the diffusion of information

### Permanence

- when information is almost always impermanent people operate with
  the assumption that the specifics of their actions will almost
  certainly be forgotten.

### "Provability"

- people's tendency to validate.
  - if it's not easy to validate, people wouldn't default to
    trying to validate information
  - beyond some threshold of efficiency/effectiveness of
    validating info, people start doing it all the time

### Permeability

- language and other barriers to the consumption of
  representations of information.

- this relates to the proficiency of information processing agents to
  consume information representations and parallels representability
  - we're evolving from a world where information was represented
    neurologically in infinitely many ways to one where there are
    universal representations of information that can be consumed by
    almost any information processing entity
- we had individually distinct neurological representations of
  information
  - then our social behaviors encouraged us to increasingly harmonize
    abstractions. this is what resulted in language AND forced us to
    expand our mind.
    - IMO, this is where man began to name the animals.
  - mankind harmonized its abstractions and as it did, language began
    to emerge. there are other aspects to this theory.
  - throughout history, we have spoken many different languages, which
    present boundaries
  - written language emerged
  - digitized information representations emerged
- if you take this concept to its limit, then information becomes
  increasingly permeable.

### Representability

- at first, the only information with physically manisfestations are
  written language, architecture (and..?)
  - more types of information become representable
    - we develop increasingly complicated means of abstraction,
      developing needs for new words/concepts

  - we also establish methods of preserving information
    - the written form of music composition

- then we have analog representations
  - by the end of the 19th century, we have photography and
    phonography to record sounds as they were. obviously, this has
    profound implications. people evolve similarly to how they did
    with permanence/provability

- we end with digitized (and/or some kind of fluid quantum
  representations of information)
  - digitized representations can be expanded to encode any
    information with varying degrees of parity

### "Trackability"

- the concept of a spime: an object that can be tracked in
  space/time for its lifetime
- provenence: data increasingly includes information about its
  source, its handling and its transformations
  - with provenance, you keep track of how data was transformed
    at various stages.
  - but also, it is related to copyright and licensing

### ??

- (something representing our ability to manipulate data with
  machine learning, in particular)

### Physicality (aphysicality)

the notion that more information becomes increasingly spaceless. its
representations can be tokenised, made more portable, and are mass
produced until exact copies of information are more numerous. then
eventually, all representations of information can be digitized,
copied at the click of a button and distributed anywhere.

- we haven't minimized physicality yet. this is more of an ideal that
  will never be fully reached.

### Temporality (atemporality)

- we haven't quite reached atemporality yet.
  - eventually the accumulation of information includes an
    increasing range of what was produced in history
  - not only that, but our access to and accumulation of
    information begins to approach that of what is effectively
    what will be produced in history
    - so, the specifics of information might be different, but
      qualitatively, the range of information doesn't evolve much.
    - some information is purely metaphysical (laws of science,
      combinatorial enumerations of things, etc) this information is
      mostly not connected to time or space.
    - so we can generate more of it, it will always remain them
      same, we can access it from anywhere, etc.

- information economics and sociophysical aspects of information
  - elaborate on information economics (as distinct from economics of
    content...)

# Information as Chaotic Programs similar to Genetic Programs

- information mutates and self-replicates. it's easy to create,
  sometimes impossible to destroy.
  - businesses as chaos

### Programs in Chaos have Update Mechanisms and Source Control

### Informational Morphology

- information mutates, but more importantly, there are morphological
  operators that can be imagined that operate on information,
  structured using graph theory and category theory.
  - these can be applied to memes, holons, datums and iotas, but it's
    a bit tricky to model these. philosophers have been arguing about
    it for the entirety of history.
    - of course, we all see what we want to see, which is what we show
      and teach others. some philosophers developed conceptions of
      metaphysics which lent themselves to establishing paradigms of
      thought, trapping the common person within false
    - served rulers or materialist interests.
    - how could they know?
  - for binary and grayscale data, erosion, dilation, opening and
    closing operations

- using a trained semantic/semiotic network, along with a database of
  facts like that IBM's Watson uses, morpological operators can be
  used to generated contextually coherent articles on wikipedia.
  - At first, the 'metric' of distance b/w real & fake content would
    be small. Then, gradually, adding info to other articles for
    coherence would expand the set of fake facts that are coherently
    seeded across wikipedia.
    - this is morphological dialation, applied to a set of information
  - then, eventually, the algorithm/process would be capable of
    adding/removing information to maintain informational coherence
    - these are essentially the morphological operators open & close,
      applied to information
  - how to apply these techniques when it is or is not possible to
    snapshot datasets?
  - BTFW -- by the fucking way -- this idea is computationally
    intractible you dumbfuck motherfuckers. LMAO, so don't say "he's
    dangerously intelligent" because i'm actually smarter than that
    now.
    - either give me credit where credit is due -- or don't. either
      put me in contact with likeminded intelligent people, where i
      can live in peace -- or don't. but do not gaslight me into being
      a weaker, more paranoid version of myself, where i regurgitate
      non-sense about NSA/crypto/blahblah/RandomNumberGenerator
    - i would recommend surveilling me with someone that understands
      what i talk or think about -- AND YOU CAN'T


# The Economics of Content Production/Consumption Lead to Market Saturation

- (this has already been described in the first part, but needs more explanation)
- the economics of content production/consumption in a converging or
  converged world
  - this is where the [somewhat poorly organized] articles paradox of
    creativity and death of creativity are relevant

- [Paradox of Creativity](http://te.xel.io/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html)

here's an essay on the death of novelty and originality as the limits
on information diffusion are annihilated by the singularity. the
information overload, particularly the nature of how information
distribution becomes skewed, results in generations of people who are
increasingly severed from the past. if we understand this moving
forward, we can use social engineering to preserve the pieces of our
identity and culture which will otherwise be completely lost.

### (Delineate b/w people, autonomous information-processing agents and instances of information)

- basically, in what forms can information be stored (quickly) and
  who/what can process it?
- autonomous agents and containers of information
  - how information moves, replicates and mutates
  - in the past, information could be totally restricted by physically
    restricting the vessel(s) of that information.
    - how this changes with a completely connected world where
      information can be freely reproduced at zero cost

### (Describe how (instances of information) are composed of references to imagery, signified by semiotics)

- the semiotics of information, content, media, art, culture,
  language, society, etc.
  - particularly, the distribution of information about symbols
    (signifiers) among people
  - moving forward into more connected societies, how brand
    recognition, content awareness, etc is fundamentally more
    difficult to create/maintain.
    - it is more expensive, possibly prohibitively expensive to market

###

- agents and vessels of information internalize representations &
  references to information
  - these references can be understood in many different dimensions
    - geographically: where does the information exist, physically? it
      matters
    - in aggregate: how many references are there to the information?
      - how is it distributed?
    - why is the information relevant to people?
  - how can these references be used in an event-driven manner as
    "hooks" for further reactions?
    - so, more widely distributed references provide a basis for
      imagery that provokes predictable reactions.
  - (analogy to the game of go/othello), where the references are
    eventually turned against you or against your adversary.

  - information is diffused primarily through communication networks:
    IRL, social media, etc.
    - can also be diffused through other representations, some of
      which are phsycial: billboard ads, street art, stickers, ...
    - recently, non-human agents like bots can be automated and
      controlled to influence people.
      - this is cheap, difficult to trace to a person
  - but more of our information is delivered through some virtual
    network built on top of the internet, often managed by a newsfeed
    algorithm

- these information representations are linked to abstract semiotic
  signs, which people interpret individually.
  - the democratization of content production along with diminshing
    economic opportunities will lead to overload of content
  - (move insights from below on how this creates unmarketable
    cultural noise that prevents semiotic interpretations from being
    created/managed)

- (the content overload mentioned above) makes it increasingly
  complicated to understand/predict how information will be
  interpreted.
  - further, the economics and inability to market information render
    it difficult for authorities or institutions to respond *to a
    culture that is evolving exponentially faster*
  - it's just important to see this coming, so that we can respond to
    it now with an understanding of what technocultural turbulence
    will be like before we encounter it.

###

- for example, in the 50's when there were three TV channels,
  - (1) how efficiently could we deliver a message to the american
    people?
  - (2) how confidently could we be that they recognized the language of
    symbols used in that communication in some predictable way?
  - for the first issue, there are answers that have already been
    implemented. there are SMS notification services for emergencies.
    - however, i'm not worried about instantaneous notification in an
      emergency.
    - () how can any group leverage communication channels for general
      purposes *in a predictable way* when there are exponentially
      many channels, many of which are algorithmically controlled
      - machine learning algorithms can't be indexed
    - the exponential expansion and variety of channels (in the purest
      sense of the word) create a situation where it becomes difficult
      or prohibitively expensive to inform and relate to the general
      public
  - that takes care of the first question above, which is trivial to
    anticipate. the second issue is much more complicated. through
    communication and consumption of information, individuals in
    society create their own understanding of how symbols, called
    signifiers in semiotics, map to the concepts they signify.
    - if you want to predict how an individual or group will respond
      to messaging, you need to know how they interpret the language
      you use to convey your ideas.
      - some of this language is textual or verbal
      - much of it, particularly the strongest signaling, uses
        language that trigger associations with imagery.
        - it's harder for people to understand these associations
          because sometimes they are subconscious.
    - effective communications leverages this language of symbols that
      are inculcated through a common, shared experience. that's what
      allows marketers to be confident they will provoke a strong,
      emotional reaction.
      - but if you take away the homogeny of symbols, it's difficult
        to predict how usage of these ad hoc languages of imagery will
        affect recipients.
        - in marketing, you want to nudge the recipient along a
          decision tree by leveraging associations that make your
          product pitch more appealing or even relevant. you might
          also use vivid imagery to create a strong first impression
          of your brand.
        - in public relations, when trying to unify a country full of
          people fighting over issues provoked by foreign influence,
          is it easier or harder for institutions to appeal to
          citizens to react uniformly? no, it's exponentially more
          complicated because the influence any one channel can
          project is limited AND the language of imagery has been
          diluted.
      - without prediction and quantification, one can't ... public
        relations strategies makes it difficult to design...

### (inculcation of a langauge of imagery)

- constant inculcation of a fairly homogenous set of primary symbols,
  that are recognized almost universally across the culture
  - e.g. freedom, liberty, the declaration of independence, etc in
    America.
  - e.g. Star Wars, Harry Potter and other super-IP's that are
    recognized almost universally
  - these cultural symbols can signify different associations to many
    different people, but they are distinct from less widely diffused
    symbols in that:
    - they are universally recognized among a culture
    - they have a cohesive, mostly homogenous set of meanings as a
      basis.
    - crucially, there is an assumption that almost everyone in a
      society can communicate with these symbols, both with words and
      by provoking imagery
      - i.e. the difference between using a (basic) reference to tv show
        Star Trek and using a complicated spock versus lizard-man
        reference
        - the first can be interpreted by almost everyone in America
          and, even if they don't understand your specific meaning
          using Star Trek (just the TV show) as a reference, they can
          anticipate what most people would
      - again, the difference is that there are symbols that have
        diffused with consistency such that almost everyone can expect
        other people to identify common signified concepts
        - then there are those, where not only will few people
          recognize the symbol, if they do, signified interpretations
          can not be anticipated with much degree of certainty without
          additional information layered in to clarify
    - there are about 100 cultural universals shared by humanity.
      these are a completely different subject, but most of them
      function as symbols people recognize that can be used as
      imagery.
      - but there are symbols shared amoung groups, societies and
        cultures that are virtually universal within those groups.

- the point i'm trying to make is that when the economics of content
  creation/distribution/consumption are disrupted as they almost
  certainly will be, this phenomenon of the creation and maintainence
  of a language of shared imagery slows to a trickle. those widely
  diffused symbols with cohesive, signified interpretations that can
  be conveyed with confidence simply do not reach the level of
  distribution in society for them to be considered universal.
  - while this may seem trivial or abstract, it may pose unanticipated
    communication difficulties for many cultures and nations.
    - so, for example, if you needed a strong set of images to provoke
      a patriotic sense of duty among your citizens, but you don't
      have an education system, then you likely haven't deployed that
      language of imagery and associations among your citizens.
      - therefore, in this situation, predicting how messaging to your
        citizens will affect how they react is almost impossible.
    - America won't deal with problems as severe as not having an
      education system, but we are a long ways away from a system of
      three TV channels, where it is trivial to know what information
      people have consumed and how they interpret messaging.
      - that is not to say that we should artificially limit channels
        of communication

- this is a warning that foreign adversaries now have unparalleled
  reach into our nation to slowly build out their own languages of
  imagery or subvert ours to exert more influence over citizens, to
  constrain narratives and to
  - so, how does their capacity to mutate the more logical aspects of
    human communication (semiotics, imagery, association) change when
    America's capacity to cultivate these primary elements of
    communication is greatly diminished?
    - it means that, as cultural artifacts become indistinguishable
      and innumerable while recognition/relevance of those artifacts
      is some minimal amount of people, it affects human language and
      communcation in a profound way by shifting beneath our feet the
      mechanics, proficiency and predictability of utilizing language
      layered with imagery.
- while it is hard to quantify whether this phenomena will actually be
  exhibited to a relevant degree, it is also important to note that
  this happens very early for America and the West and happens much
  later for most of the rest of the world.
  - this means that leaders who signal over communication networks
    hoping to call their citizens to action will be less able to
    clearly convey a message that delivers on creating a predictable
    emotional response.

### example: progression of meme culture in the 2010's

  - how has the uniformity in meaning changed for individual memes?
  - how has the predictability of a signified concept changed amoung
    meme recipients.
  - how has the proliferation of meme's changed?
    - do new memes spread slow or fast? do old meme's die young in
      2017?
  - is it easier or harder to create a new meme that catches on and
    takes the world by storm, making you an unlikely and unwilling
    celebrity?
    - it doesn't fucking happen does it? that was really fast. all of
      five fucking years, but these are meme's ... who tf cares?
  - meme's are not very important. they are cheap to make and
    ephemeral, but most meme-like images shared on FB/Twitter today
    are almost unique. it is less likely to see new memes pick up wild
    momentum, though it does happen (i'd argue it is because we need
    these nearly-universally recognizable symbols and so we
    arbitrarily skyrocket the usage of almost random images because
    they tightly map to some facet of life we all need to communcate.

#### example: conspiracy theories

- another example: the recent explosion of conspiracies, most of which
  are young, incomprehensible and fake. (not necessarily "fake news")
  - in particular, i'm talking about the youtube conspiracy
    documentaries that you see.
    - people made an hour-long youtube documentary

#### political example: wtf is the deep state?

- this is an example of an imagery being mapped inconsistently (partly
  bc of spectral decoherence)
  - should this occur earlier?
  - perfect example of imagery that is being remapped so that it
    doesn't cohere to any dominant interpretation
  - while it seems that conservatives have one definition and liberals have
    another, the c...

#### another example: fake news.

  - fake news is what it is, but it layers into our culture pattern
    languages (and sets off these viral outbreaks of...)
  - it is not necessarily bad, but fake news is an effective tactic of
    information warfare that layers down exactly what the fuck i am
    talking about above that flies over the head of most people.
    - it creates these languages of imagery where those symbols are
      laid down and propagated through our culture.
    - later on, content can reference those symbols to trigger
      confusion or distraction.
  - most people won't understand the way i state my ideas above, but
    they do understand the confusion of fake news, which btw, i'm not
    sure how to define. are we talking about cosmo pizza and
    pedophiles?
    - regardless of the quirkly, distracting stories, i do not have
      confidence in our media today at all. liberal media is pushing
      toxic narratives that

# Vulnerabilities

- (@@@@@@)
  - what could be exploited?
    - amplification of information may spiral out of control (or be
      controlled via AI and thus inaccessible)
    - information economics: scarce information becomes rare
    - major network outages result in intensely inverted circumstances
      - e.g. information economics are suddenly inverted for millions
        of people who may have otherwise never experienced pre
        21st-century life

    - distributed attempts to influence newsfeed rankings (this could
      be incidental or part of an attack) result in isolation
      - goals could be to isolate groups or specific users by
        proactively running content and encouraging everyone to react
        to it, then manipulating IRL, social media and alogirthm
        response
        - this might create isolated subnetworks of users (but i don't
          know enought about FB newsfeed)
        - can FB ever know that, for one user, they are receiving a
          representative experience of the FB platform via the
          algorithms? how do they score this?
        - for more info on, clip from draft:
          from-the-parapets-of-alexandria.md (part 4)
        - encouraging people you influence to downrank posts/pages/etc
          from specific people, so that their rank gets dinged
          - this is not so different from rallying people on a page to
            troll someone
            - coordinated harassment appears to happen on social
              media, though what i've seen is fairly light

  - other things that can go wrong, but not exploited per se
    - artificial amplification of information crowds out real signals.
      - since being proactive with content, signaling, helps structure
        it so that it provides better insights to marketers (etc.)
      - artificial dampening of signals has a similar effect
        - if/when some topic is censored, this affects other tools
          that are built on top of tech (i.e. NSA surveillance, which
          *could* miss signals if censorship artificiall dampens them)
        - or it's presentation on social media is tailored via
          newsfeed algorithms that turn down the volume on unfavorable
          presentations of that info
    - adversarialy structured interactions can feed into themselves
      (like automated trading bots)

    - adversarialy structured information produces hard-to-predict
      consequences in algorithms
      - if you want to dampen a topic, you can structure news reports
        which are similar and compete for search ranking for current
        results
      - so, there is some semantic overlap that causes algorithms to
        not function properly

  - long-term dynamics:
    - "censorship's effect on cultural development" from parapets-part-2
      - in this context, i'd rather stay away from "censorship" at
        least in name
      - how does the supply and variety of information in a region
        affect its development?
    - similarly, prolonged isolation's effect on cultural/economic
      development in a nation.
      - so if a nation is much less connected to the rest of the
        world,

  - how to make these things better?
    - (1) more emphasis on strong notions of identity
      - above and beyond just "verified users get slight increase in
        ranking"
    - (2) network analysis on pages/accounts with similarity in
      access/management patterns
      - there has to be a human somewhere and humans can only do one
        thing at one time.
      - if pages/groups are being accessed by the same accounts froma
        myriad of IP addresses or geolocations, that's suspect. (these
        things are already done)
      - tighter restraints on some API interactions
        - most of these things suck for the common internet "power
          user" today
     - (3) newsfeed algorithms should make decisions that are
       orthogonal or anti-parallel to the optimal decisions
       - that is, they should make the wrong decisions sometimes, but
         they shouldn't be too horribly wrong
       - newsfeed should also try to harmonize it's results.
         - see draft: parapets-4
     - (4) newsfeed should maybe be more interactive to get more
       confident readings on what you want to see at that moment. like
       choose-your-own-adventure newsfeed
       - yes, you can have friend lists, or smart feeds, etc. that's
         not what i mean.
       - this is just a high-level pipe-dream idea, but if you change
         the infinite scrolling to something that "scroll" into
         multiple topic directions
         - so it's still as simple as scrolling down infinitely, but
           the UI action subtly presents choice

# Anticipating Information Warfare

- understanding everything thus far and reacting to the situation
  early, in anticipation of information warfare

### why is all warfare essentially information warfare?

### what is usually meant by information warfare?

    - competition over information and its distribution to influence
      the behavior of groups
      - these groups can be larger scale: social, political, military
      - and smaller scale: units of troops or insurgents, individuals
        suspected of espionage, departments in a corporation
      - typically, the more surgical the targeting, the less
        information is created as a result.
    - the definition of "information warfare" blurs with ideas from
      PR, communications, marketing and branding, which are
      essentially objective competition over information and its
      distribution
      - but if used in a military sense, often implies achieving some
        tactically or strategically relevant change in behavior by
        creating, distorting, diffusing, etc. information
    - information warfare is distinct from other forms of war in many
      different ways, including that information can be created and is
      much more difficult to destroy.
      - in economic warfare, you're competing over resources,
        opportunities and relationships which are exchanged
      - in armed conflict, you and your adversary have more clearly
        defined resources which can be created, moved, destroyed, etc.
        - these resources, at least at a higher level, are more
          clearly defined and quantified.
      - also, it's important to distinguish that these resources can
        be clearly added/removed from the conflict, whereas
        information is everywhere and is created as a result of
        changes in the environment, the action of people or autonomous
        agents, etc.
        - it's something that is created everywhere by everything, but
          isn't so easily destroyed.
        - information may be more fundamental to the universe than
          matter. it is thought to be preserved by black holes, etc.
        - but information has a life of its own and is difficult to to
          restrict its diffusion without either coercing the container
          of information or destroying it entirely

  - some examples of tactics in information warfare
    - most techniques from marketing or branding
    - restricting diffusion of information, generally or from specific
      groups of people
    - manipulating the presentation of information

### when is information warfare advantageous?

  - .... always? lulz
    - when the adversary is strong:
      - they are more capable of pushing a large volume of information
        (information flux)
      - they are more likely to be perceived as credible
      - they can react quickly and powerfully in the short term
      - they can be more confident about the permanence of their
        long-term narratives
      - because their information is dominant, people default to
        usually comparing other information to the default worldview
    - when the adversary is weak:
      - they can influence the strong, without overt warfare, and
        promote narratives counter to short & long-term objectives of
        their enemies
      - this is particularly effective in the long-term when they can
        establish information/narratives to be used later on that, at
        the time, don't seem threatening or the adversary's goal is
        not obvious
        - when the weak adversary gains strength, the information they
          pushed subversively can become more useful.
    - when the boundaries of a country's communication networks are
      porous and highly connected this is both an advantage and
      disadvantage

# boundaries of communication networks in information warfare

- when the social network boundaries are more tightly locked down:
      - there are negative aspects:
        - it becomes harder to establish relationships with the
          outside
        - your population's understanding of the world becomes skewed
          and it is very easy to make long-term strategic blunders
          - the everyday people and the leadership are detached from
            reality and unware of trends and options.
        - economically and politically, you are at an incredible
          disadvantage.
          - it is typically harder to engage in free trade without
            restrictions or government regulation
          - it's easier for trade partners to discover
            products/relationships in societies that are not closed

      - there are benefits in the long-term:
        - because your adversaries or other neutral players have not
          been able to diffuse information into your society with much
          proficiency, the logical copies of information within the
          minds of your population are fewer in number and much weaker
          in proportion to alternative information
          - so, therefore, it's easier to suppress information you
            don't like because *it never took root at all*
          - also, you just never have to deal with it. information
            contrary to the mainstream almost doesn't exist.
          - many countries seem to prefer this because they don't want
            information they can't control to disrupt or dilute their
            culture, which is something that many Westerners don't
            understand or even find offensive.
            - these countries may be trying to protect their cultural
              identity in the long-term. if they open their doors with
              no restrictions, then foreigners with more money and
              power will control what information becomes dominant.

      - IMO, these few benefits are grossly outweighed by the lost
          economic opportunities. these are things that mostly benefit
          people in power in those countries, but also can be an
          attempt to preserve cultural identity in spite of
          modernization

- language boundaries
  - the nodes in the the social graph can be grouped by languages,
    which are each connected by a bilingual set of the population that
    can act as a membrane by which information can easily pass into
    the other language groups
  - this only effects irl/p2p conversations, but today most
    information is refracted across multiple languages
  - there is less information diffusion from japanese/chinese to
    english than from english to japanese/chinese
    - this is because there are less channels for information to
      diffuse through (i.e. there are less english-speaking people
      literate in japanese/chinese than vice versa and so the
      information flow is slightly assymetric)
  - information discoverability is fragmented at the language level
    on the internet.
    - i.e. your google query for an english word is not going to pull
      up pages containing the french and chinese language equivalents
      for that concept (that is, unless those pages used SEO
      techniques)

#### The North Korean Calendar as an example of creating an artificial boundary

- North Korea's Juche calendar oddly carries an air of religious
  significance in a nation that embraces marxism and its atheist
  tendencies. Still, they detest imperialism and have essentially
  established a monarchy, so it's not the only contradictory aspect of
  an ideology concocted in complete isolation.
  - what else does the Juche Calendar do? It creates an artificial
    division b/w the interior and exterior, which molds the citizen's
    minds to conceptualized historical events and attribute them to
    Juche years.
  - while calendar systems specific to religious traditions or
    cultures are common, the North Korean calendar system further
    divorce's its citizens conceptualization of history from that of
    the rest of the world.
    - so, inner track propaganda establishes awareness of history in
      terms of Juche years and makes it difficult for information
      about history of the "outer realm" which has managed to
      penetrate into the isolated country to establishe relevance. it
      is mind control and is actually an example of Juche philosophy's
      bizarre conception of german idealism and subject/object --
      essentially "we're wrong and we do not give a fuck".  penetrate
      into the isolated country.
    - ![picture of the outer realm from Mortal Kombat]())
  - the creation of this calendar system signifies the epoxification
    of north korea's intent to NEVER let its citizens become aware of
    the outside world. in every way and in every facet of life, Kim
    Il-Sung and the original usurpers of North Korea abused the
    conception of flawed ideology and concocted a long-term strategy
    to be executed over the course of several generations which they
    always knew would be necessarily traumatic and isolatory for their
    citizens.
    - i don't believe this is a common motivation for establishing a
      calendar system, but most calendar systems have endured over a
      thousand years.

####

- narrative of american interventionalist foreign policy as being
  evil, self-serving and (etc..)
  - by the way, i don't believe this narrative and find it to be
    offensive. policy and politics are never simple, especially when
    it comes to conflict. the same action can be interpreted in many
    ways, this narrative is ludicrous and toxic. America stands up for
    human rights, civil rights and justice in the world. America uses
    our power responsibly for the greater good and we do so to defend
    freedom, justice and economic development around the world.
  - A dominant force that doesn't wisely and justly exercise its power
    will inevitably destabalize itself. in the later 20th century, we
    were lucky to have America as a superpower willing to stand up
    because Soviet Communism was destined to require an empire to
    sustain itself economically.

  - the adoption of this narrative by radicals could lead to
    exploitation via information warfare. in the short-term, it has
    disrupted our response in the beginning of the War on Terror
    - it demoralized the public and prevented us from acting in unison
      to support our military.
    - it resulted in a political swing to the left b/w 2004-2008

  - in the long-term, (if america were to cede its superpower status,)
    this narrative may become dominant. a dominant power could use
    narrative like a page in a coloring book to paint the united
    states foreign policy as evil
    - (as a dominant power), they would be able to build on top of this
      and distort it however they want to keep us in check.
    - if the narrative wasn't a defining component of so many
      citizens' worldviews, then our enemies wouldn't have the
      opportunity to build on top of it in the future.
      - i personally don't believe the narrative at all and think the
        opposite, with maybe a few exceptions, is true. america is a
        force for good in the world.

- ... or wasn't a primary factor empassioning liberals to encourage
  demoralization

- american (vulnerability) - which one would you want to be?
  - a broken down beater, unlocked with nothing in it
  - a mercedez with the windows rolled down four inches. it has a
    state of the art security system, but lined with luxury's like a
    handicapped claw game
  - a bulletproof limo with tinted windows, SCIF certified, secure
    VOIP and a convoy


###

- (originally after the section on information flux in ancient times)
- in modern times, we've gotten used to instantaneous communication
  via the internet
  - but when telecom networks are disrupted, people will be caught off
    guard by the change
  - in modern warfare, this has been a tactic for armed conflict in
    developed nations.
  - however, the contrast between a state that has adapted to the
    possibilities enabled by wide internet penetration and the state
    that suddenly has none is stark.
    - this means that there is suddenly no social media, no news and
      no mass communication.
    - here, whoever controls any communication infrastructure, at
      first, has an advantage.
      - while there is complete chaos, people will be eager for any
        information and there will be little capacity to dominate the
        narrative via sheer quantity of information
    - whoever can reestablish network infrastructure first wins.
      - however, if your technology is destroyed via EMP, every
        circuit is fried. the smaller and more fragile, the more
        certain it will be affected. everything including compact
        disks and magnetic tape will be destroyed.
    - whoever has emergency response or military assets that are
      hardened can immediately respond.
      - much of america's hardware has been hardened against EMP, but
        such an attack will result in chaos.
  - but the point is, without that information infrastructure, we
    revert to sociophysical communication methods.
    - this is a nightmare scenario for the american military, so you
      can bet they have thought this out.
    - this sets up a situation where people are vulnerable to
      misinformation while they are desperate for information to
      explain their circumstances, their options, etc.

- not all societies have strong (internet participation rates)
  - so people in developed societies misunderstand conflicts in these
    areas.
    - "the war is for your mind"
    - in order to subdue an enemy, you have to convince them that you
      can overpower them or, if you are not their enemy, per se, you
      still have to leverage communication networks to convey this
      - example: fighting the taliban in afganistan
  - but if the war is for their mind and it's up to us to establish
    ourselves not as invaders, but as liberators, then communication
    is incredibly challenging when the networking infrastructure is
    not there.


- monad proxy as root. the all is the one, the one is the all.






Antifragility and Social Engineering for "National Security"
==========

- philosophy of #AntiFragility is being abused to feed a greedy
  industry to control dissidents, whose voices are never heard.
  - your work is amazing, but what I have seen in my own life with
    Interventions & Transport implies that the worst of us are
    dominating
  - worst of all, while our greatest threat is ourselves, for which we
    need #AntiFragile systems, our greatest fear should be nihilism.
  - antifragile design patterns applied 2 #Sociophysical systems
    reinforce stability when people care about life.#TechnoNihilism
    disenchants us
  - technonihilism yields system-wide #Demoralization, undermining
    many of the incentivization design patterns in today's
    #AntiFragile systems
  - worst of all? when ppl confuse #Utilitarian, #PassiveAggressive,
    #Sociopathic behaviors 4 #AntiFragile systems & are blind to their
    humanity
  - we will lose all connection to our humanity, our individuality,
    all respect for our fellow man, for ourselves and this nihilism is
    terminal.
  - i don't want 2 demonize the ideas of antifragility, but they are
    being applied 2 identify the best of us w/ the worst of
    us,treating Übermenschen like cancer
  - what results is a world where it is not only impossible for humans
    to excel or innovate, we have destroyed anyone or anything that
    stood out
  - this world's hierarchy is flat, where finance is controlled by
    elites and nothing but sociophysical mechanisms are available 4
    "advancement"
  - Antifragility's sociophysical incentivization structures collapse,
    but they require passive aggressive tactics & dissent was never
    allowed


UBI, Team Sociopathy and a Depressing, but Exigent Economic REALITY CHECK
============

if it looks like a duck...

- It's starting to look a lot like #COMMUNISM, which deprives you of
  Financial Capital and monopolizes Social Capital
  - UBI, a bait and switch, for a gov't that will have stripped U of
    freedom & dignity. it's the last nail in the coffin of respect for
    Human Life
  - imagine extending today's #Sociophysical methods of control 2 a
    world where your only income's a check the govt MAY be nice enough
    2 write U
  - you will wake up in a world where your only value is your
    conformity. anything deviating from that will be violently
    contained & amputated.
  - when the society has essentially lost the right to property
    (financial capital is unobtainable), your only means of influence
    is social....
  - what is happening now. the WORST of society is gaining influence &
    competing in team sociopathy, w/o regard for dignity, ethics or
  virtue
  - when the state monopolizes social capital & treats social
    hierarchies as territory, the ppl who inherit control are those
    dominating today
  - so there will be human networks, through which authority is
    projected by sociopaths, but they will have no true authority and no
    ethics
  - further, the winners of #DantesInferno #Thunderdome who competed
    in team sociopathy will have destroyed all the values that could
    save us
  - these people are completely defined by ego and materialism, however
    they may try to convince you they are "clear" or selfless.
  - therefore,these sociopathic bottom feeders will end up on top, but
    are the most susceptible 2 #TechnoNihilism's obliteration of our
    humanity


Comments on HMOL
=============

I have a unique understanding of philosophy, but most of the stuff I
think might be novel turns out to be naïveté and partially original if
I'm lucky. my own path of understanding has been slow and grueling,
since I pieced together my own understanding, always with the
intention to transvaluate it to the academic model, resulting in depth
via novelty & originality

- [the encyclopedia of human thermodynamics - HMOL](http://www.eoht.info/)
  - pretty much the most comprehensive source on social physics and
    everything related it it. it's also one of the only sites i know
    of where the content models social phenomena in terms of social
    physics, instead of framing their content in the top-down
    macroscopic language of sociology
  - cite the social physics paper on studying differences in
    physically/virtually connected social networks
    - site other papers?
  - mention that i found this site while searching for the term
    "social mechanics"
    - i haven't consumed much of their content, but i will eventually.
      i want to finish this 20,000 word treatise on social physics
      with a fairly original conception of the ideas before i
      internalize their content, framing everything else i think/write
      in terms of their language.
    - glossing over some of the pages and just looking at the table of
      contents gave me a few interesting ideas.
      - however, ideas on configurational entropy and things like that
        were original and resulted from trying to design 2D particle
        simulation algorithms as basic examples of social physics,
        causing me to have eureka moment comparing social situations
        to thermal dynamics
        - i realize there was configurational/conformational entropy
          in the graph structures of conversations/interactions
          forming at an idealized cocktail party, for example.
        - and from here, i began to draw more and more connections to
          thermodynamics.
      - but now, returning to their content, i realize that they have
        explained mostly all of these in thorough detail.
      - however, if i were to read it all now, as research, i would
        frame all my ideas in term of what i ingest. what i wrote
        would be meaningless and would almost certainly appear as
        though i copied them or maybe every plagarized them.
      - instead, i want originality and an a posteriori understanding.
        i want to struggle and become stronger through that
        struggle. then i want to reconcile that a posteriori
        understanding with a more rationalist conception. it is
        inefficient, but hey -- this is where i am and it's a fairly
        unique situation for someone who is very intelligent.
