=========

- Religions are basically different understandings of the same
  thing. It's like a selected few mystics through the ages all read
  the same Choose Your Own Adventure book and, along the way, made
  several distinct theological decisions. In consequence, this leads
  to distinct understandings on the same philosophical issues that are
  in fact older than man's memory. In actuality, each belief system
  differs most at the surface in it's imagery and identity. When you
  examine their actual substance, what they share is far more
  expansive than the details at the surface that distinguish them.

- this content is mostly only relevant to overly academic people. what
  content do I have that helps someone in need to help give them a
  sense of purpose?
  - this is a measure of the effectiveness and utility of a religion
  - how helpful is it to someone?
  - does it benefit people in power or the common person?
  - how available is the information?
  - how quickly can the teachings help someone in need?
  - do they need a literal interpretation of the text or years of
    study to apply it in their own lives?
  - why are the stories relevant?
  - can it save a life? why? how?
  - how do the social institutions surrounding a religion and belief
    system adapt to the needs of people: followers, non-believers and
    apostates?
- where to put this?

We spend our life being defined by things we don't understand. And
Several decades into their lives, few people understand the forces at
work defining every decision they make, outlining their choices and
forming the semiotic basis of every thought they have.

Why not understand the forces at work in life, as early as possible?
So why not create your own destiny, free from being a pawn in someone
else's game?

#### The Goal of [Directed Cognitive Enhancement](/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html)

> ~transvaluation of all (cognition or cognitive faculties or skills)~
> and of all information.

- i had the above insight at the rink, but i can't remember exactly
  where i was going with it. whatever it was, it was incredibly
  profound
  - i think i mean that to master the mind, you have to create a
    transvaluation of all your modular cognitive faculties.
  - you do this by learning as much as you can about the world.
    - doing so literally models your mind around a kind of
      "transvaluation"
  - once you learn a critical mass of arts, culture, language, skills,
    etc, your mind destructures everything. from here, every
    additional skill/etc that you learn is essentially the same.
    - that this accelerates your rate of learning is well known, but i
      think it maps to the same metaphysical structure that i
      mentioned in my article on meditation
    - so, the more you learn, the more your mind is forced to reshape
      itself into a form that represents "the one is the all" or (the
      monad proxy)
  - doing so also makes your brain more & less efficient. it has more
    options for dynamically recombining parts of skills it has
    absorbed, but then also must maintain more information in total
    - it may be possible that doing so forces your mind to trigger
      some innate ability for quantum computing, vastly increasing its
      efficiency in time and energy
      - but that's conjecture, no quantum mechanisms in the brain have
        been discovered

- it's literally a religion about being a Nexialist (a la
  [Voyage of the Space Beagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Space_Beagle))
  - nexialist =~ polymath or factotum

Extrapolating from a basic assessment of the math, there are
implications and ramifications that attain preponderance, standing
above everything else. By failing to fully understand sociophysical
phenomena, by stubbornly clinging to ideology constructed around a
fast-fading paradigm. By refusing to allow adaptation, we fall victim
to Nietzche's danger of dangers. This is not to say that morality and
well-defined, top-down values systems will themselves be antiquated.
Quite the opposite: we need to reinforce those systems that already
exist, but augment them with agile, flexible and antifragile values
systems that can fill in the gaps.

This is counterintuitive: traditionally, values systems inculcated via
belief systems required a critical mass of adoption. In a region,
in-phase investment of energy from its follers was required to counter
specral decoherence and to perpetuate the belief system. Once a level
of (saturation) was acquired, other people began to take the values
system into account, whether they believed or not. Therefore, to
acquire that density or saturation -- and for theological reasons --
belief systems needed to be rooted in doctrine that (remained
unchanging) for generations.

- the doctrine drew its authority upon this (unchangingness)

- another paradox: a system that only exists to adapt to whatever it
  encounters:
  - changes too quickly and becomes destabilized
  - has no root in truth and will hold nothing sacred
  - cannot be the basis of a values system rooted in truth: one that
    is meant to be shared.

- it needs to be agile to adapt to (drastic) phenomenological and
  teleological (changes) to society via technology

- such an agile belief system needs to fill in the gaps.
  - it doesn't need to involve everyone. (i.e. "clear the planet")
  - the mechanics of updating such a belief system imply that the the
    greater number of followers:
  - the greater the time/energy required to update
- as updates are "pushed" more often, with more followers, more
  variants.
  - and the propensity increases for each variant to:
    - build/operate fallible institutions out of line with the people
      who are guiding the adaptation. these mistakes in instituion or
      doctrine can take generations to understand, but they can easily
      lead to situaions that bring down an entire religion.

Human civilization is embarking on a paradigm shift of cultural flux,
precipitated by modernization, globalization and the Singularity. Does
this shift imply an opportunity for the next major belief system to
establish the semiotic foundation of human thought for the next
astrological age? Yes, it does. However, this is not an opportunity.
It's a necessity and something that must be handled with care (and)
unparalleled foresight. We must revise semiotic frameworks used by
humanity to engineer the emergent of beneficent teleological
phenomena.

# The Intersection of Semiotics and Phenomenology

Teleology coalesces as the intersection of semiotics and
phenomonology, as they relate to the common sociocultural experience.
People map phenomena to semiotic signs and develop an ontologically
oriented perspective on how they interrelate. Because a specific
teleological perspective of phenomena describes the purpose that they
serve in the world, then these ideas must at a minimum be modeled as
the relationship between at least a pair of semiotic signs, though
these could be identical signs. Graph theory presents a basis for
modelling teleology, but doesn't capture the categorical nature of an
ontology.

### Teleology is Usually Incidental, But Indispensable

Most teleological perspectives of phenomena precipitate within
cultures incidentally. It simply became more useful for us (to do so)
as human life become increasingly sophisticated and complex. As our
roles became more diverse and specialized, there were increasingly
many concepts, processes and phenomena to navigate. The need arose for
people ignorant of material cause of phenomena to discern the
functional relationships between them. Material cause isn't necessary
for us to leverage these phenomena. Further, many of these phenomena
lack root in the material. Observing and abstracting the teleological
structure of phenomena in human life was a first step to packing up
beliefs and knowledge crucial for survival for propagation to
subsequent generations.

The pace of sociocultural change rapidly increases as we approach the
Singularity. If we aren't focused on identifying dynamics and trends
in our collective ontological perspective of teleology, then our
culture will begin to disintegrate, as well as our ability to
propagate knowledge of how to operate these phenomena to fulfill the
needs humans share in life. Again, as we become increasingly
specialized, the sociocultural facets of life become increasingly
convoluted. At no time in history does our life become more complex
faster than it does today, as we approach the s-curve of the
Singularity.

With enough resources dedicated to understanding this upcoming change,
we can harness teleological engineering to establish the underpinnings
of the next sociocultural operating system.

#

The question of what man will do once the artificial intelligence
revolution sweeps over our culture, leaving us idle in paradise is not
so complicated: we will maintain our cultural artifacts. In fact, we
must do so, otherwise we will succumb to cultural chaos.

To design the components and interactions of the 21st century
teleology is part of Oneirontology's mission. It is a powerful idea
that humanity might engineer semiotics and semiotic mappings to evoke
particular teleological teleological relations in the common
individual's experience. This idea is particularly relevant to an
increasingly virtual world built upon interactions with wholly
artifical faculties. If we interact in virtual spaces, then we have
ulimate power over the design of user interface components that people
interact with. Therefore, whereas the incidental teleological
interactions that emerged from our natural world must have been
designed by God, those that will emerge from 21st century technology
have the potential to be wholly designed by man.

(reword this?)
- what options are there for architecting the teleology of phenomena
  and experience in the 21st century?

This becomes more difficult to manage as cultural change accelerates,
which is why studying cultural universals and the ways in which our
life adapts to technology is crucial. In studying semiotics and
teleogical relationships, cultural universals form the most
fundamental map of symbols, a most universal basis upon which all
ideas emerge as intermeshed mappings.

- The range of thoughts that people can have are mapped to a countably
  infinite enumeration of trees of semiotic signs, though as they are
  re these representable in a more infinte manner.

One can aggregate across the thoughts, words, statements of others and
find that some cultural universals are more prevalent in the human
experience than others: food, water, shelter. From a high-level
perspective We all think of food about three times a day, at
least. What is the most prevalent sign? Whereas the origin of
semiotics is Symmetry, a metasign, the most prevalent individual sign
of natural human existance is the Day, which includes the day/night
cycle. It is impossible to make meaningful short-term or long-term
behavioral changes without thinking about daily habits.

- day/night cycle
  - day as the identity, night as the inverse.

- the paradigm of probabilistic computing when applied to mythos as
  compressed semiotic information.
  - the mythos gives us a large collection of ideas and beliefs that
    can be applied in various ways, each creating impressions in
    believers and tending to evoke imitation from believers
    - it's no different than how a genomic program is probabilistic
      computation: each imitated belief can be randomly executed,
      altering the environment to change the distributions determining
      the rates of execution of each (idea or idea-type) encoded into
      the religion or belief system
      - idea/belief/practice/custom
  - type theory so that the semiotic elements comprising a compressed
    mythos are applicable to many more situations
    - that is, with a more liberal interpretation of religious text,
      one gets a wider lens of applicable situations for a given
      element of the text

- (boltzman machine, helmholtz machine?) framework for an individuals
  cognitive patterns used to navigate life.
  - We experience life as a stream of information, from which our
    shifting focus collects information from sense, memory and
    reflection into a context. Every individuals contexts have a
    different structures and these contexts have varying time
    scales. The widest context for an individual might be their
    long-term memory. When we determine our behaviors, there is some
    random element to selection, which is why the notion of dynamical
    state machine programming and (boltzman machines) apply. We
    internalize reflections of our life experience into our mind and
    construct libraries of behaviors parameterized with convoluted
    contextual information.

- There are more efficient means of propagating useful culture to
  subsequent generations.
  - "the fool learns from experience" quote.
  - religious texts in this way are like zip files of accumulated
    stories that serve as a vector for the internalization of beliefs
    and the instantiation of behavior patterns that emerge from them.
  - religions have accumulated the
  - david foster wallace's Infinite Jest is put together in this
    way. stories are anachronistic and the more information you
    internalize, the more that reflection on information internalized
    before brings out a richness of understanding

- the evolutionary dynamics of mythos
  - look over
    [Evolutionary Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_dynamics)
    for inspiration

How do we adapt our culture to the (fundamentally distinct cultural
paradigm created by transcendence from modernization beyond the
singularity)

- This post covers specific systems of signs and symbols often used as
  semoitic binding points for myths.

- "the prophecy"
  - grab content from 'parapets of alexandria'
  - Materialization of the metaphysical emerges in the physical at an
    exponential rate because of the convergence of information via the
    internet, the degree of interconnectedness in the 21st century and
    the speed at which an idea travels.
  - That is, the degree of influence that a simple idea has is
    unmeasureably greater now than it was a century ago. This and the
    diversity of ideas only become more prominent from here on out.

- (this understanding of sociocultural expansion) is why we must
  become more familiar with the nature of ideas, the phenomenon of an
  [egregore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore) and recognize how
  the quickening manifestation of ideas influences reality.
  - this phenomenon has existed from time immemorial, but today
    influences the world in a fundamentally different way, which
    necessitates handling information and ideas in an (equally
    different way.)

- zipf's distribution for semiotics: what are the things people think
  about most. For humans, above all other things, it's the day. More
  generally, there is nothing more tightly coupled to what occupies
  our minds than the day and night cycle and everything related to and
  involving a day.

### Tempurature

- should this be moved to an article on social physics?
- the ideas of "temperature" and "energy" for the high-dimensional systems of
  social physics
  - spatial or physical temperature/energy/motion
  - the more metaphysical, high-dimensional temperature/energy of
    information

- social physics temperature, induced by sunrise
  - informational movement from east to west
    - increasing "temperature"

### Language & Schematic Boundaries

- should this be moved to my draft on semiotics/linguistics?

- language and information-schema induced boundaries on movement of
  types of information
  - nodes separated by language can only easily propagate most ideas
    or information in their language
  - nodes will tend to want to process information relevant to their
    fundamental schema metatype's worldview
    - that is, some schema metatypes are more or less prioritized than
      others in how nodes process information
      - these establish the schema that determines how nodes represent
        information internally
      - these worldview's establish rules for how
        nodes/particles/people interact
      - what information will they think is relevant?
      - what information/actions will they view as moral/immoral?
        - how does their worldview tell them to react to specic types
          of information/actions?
        - how do they distinguish/delineate a "type" of
          information/action?
      - what information will they think is heretical?

### Language and Geography

- should this be moved to my draft on semiotics/linguistics?

- the physical consequences of the actual geographical distribution of
  languages.
  - category theory and linguistic evolution, in the context with
    geography
    - can one anticipate linguistic evolution across several regions a
      hundred years in advance? (without technology?)
      - how does one quantify/anticipate linguistic evolution without
        writing systems?
    - if one can expect langauges to diverge, can information be
      injected into social-physical systems to "coax" or manipulate
      linguistic evolution over the course of centuries?
      - or are these systems too complicated to understand?
      - if it is possible, at what point in history does it become
        practical? after writing? after experimentation with various
        writing systems (grapheme heavy languages like chinese,
        language with expansive phonetics like sanskrit, language with
        a higher degree of grapheme-to-phoneme flexibility)
        - how does this change before/after the printing press?

- are some geographic types more advantageous for different
  informational objectives?
  - mountainous areas can preserve information & belief systems
    - e.g. tibet and alps
    - historical examples involving alps?
  - can some areas be more advantageous in affecting nearby areas?
  - areas with lots of islands effective for medium term
    experimentation?
    - e.g. greece and governance systems
  - qualities of regions on geographical edges (i.e. japan and
    england)
    - control the far east or the far west and you retain capacity to
      influence whatever conflict emerges in the middle
    - how does this change with the technology available to a
      particular area?

# [Semiotic Binding Points in the Human Condition](#semiotic-binding-points-in-the-human-condition)

Any set of signs common to a culture, nation or region can be
overlayed and mapped with multiple meanings.

- This is true of signs to a varying degree of frequency... wtf?
- Of particular interest:
  - the propensity for similar maps to arise between geographically
    distinct cultures to produce similar maps
  - also, are there roles that need to be satisfied or are often
    satisfied between different cultures.
  - these two phenomena combined are another reason that world
    religions share so many common traits.
    - ... my brain.. .wtf

- how are new cultural universals created for humanity?
  - how does the entire system congeal around a new cultural
    universal?
  - for it to be a cultural universal, isn't it required that it can't
    depend on communication to propagate it?
    - if it required communication to propagate, then it can't achieve
      a "universal" distribution and could be a cultural artifact that
      is gained, then lost.
  - can cultural universals be seeded through genetic evolution?

<a name="astrology-commerce-agriculture-and-architecture" />

### [Astrology, Commerce, Agriculture and Architecture](#astrology-commerce-agriculture-and-architecture)

Perhaps the most constant set of signs in the semiotic sense,
astrology was the only (stratum) of phenomena found to be completely
constant to pre-historic man. The weather was seasonal and
varied. Children were born young and died before old age. Previous
generations left their mark, but it faded fast. Stories and myths
could be lost. Even the earth changed from time to time, but the stars
were the only thing that never, ever changed, though it would have
been difficult to verify to any degree of certainty. The pursuit of
understanding the inner workings of celestial bodies -- their
usefulness in regard to navigation and determining geography and
eventually in profiting from commerce -- doubtlessly inspired
measurement, quantification, the transmission of knowledge, and its
maintainance.  Around the time we began to explore more complicated
verbal language, how would one explain to someone else the constant
nature of stars? How would someone prove that? How can one prove
something in the physical world is constant without measuring it?
Those questions likely lead us to pursue monolithic works and
eventually architecture. Anything which broke from the constant nature
of the stars would have been perceived as incredibly important.
e.g. planets and supernovae.

Furthermore, as a set of signs, astrology is unique across the world
.. to a degree. The northern and southern hemispheres experience
things differently and different stars are visible at different points
in the year.

The developments of primordial astrology, commerce, agriculture and
architecture were incredibly important to humanity's development from
a phenomenological perspective. Each of these represent a paradigm
shift in humanity's understanding of how we related to the world.
Astrology represents our ability to make measurements. Commerce
represents our ability to understand need and desire, to coordinate
human activity and to intentionally precipitate social hierarchy, and
to reward innovation. Agriculture represents a paradigm shift in how
we could live and separated humanity from limiting its food source to
that provided by nature and thus, eliminated many constraints on our
suitable geographic environments.  Architecture represents a
transformation in how humanity relates to our world: we began to see
the effects or greatness of those who came before us; we developed an
understanding of legacy and perhaps some kind of dominance over death;
we understood that we could separate ourselves from the dangers of the
natural world. After these four elements came the economic need for
written language and law.

<a name="math-and-science" />

### [Math and Science](#math-and-science)

Another set of fairly or very constant signs are mathematical and
scientific truths and laws, though these didn't arise quite as early
as those signs from astrology. These require a priori knowledge to
have much significance or the capacity for transmission without
communication. If you learn enough and look often enough, you'll find
that everything is more than it seems at the surface. What lies
beneath can be very useful, but is often confusing and more trouble
than its worth.

![A Visualized Genetic Ontology](/img/posts/2017-02-14-oneirontology-engineering-cultural-touchstones-for-mythos/gene-ontology.jpg)

### Merlin, Arthur and the Sword in the Stone as a Test for Intelligence

<a name="architypical-events-in-human-history" />

### [Architypical Events in Human History](#architypical-events-in-human-history)

- the creation of the world
  - and the proposed solution to the problem of evil
  - every religion needs to explain a beginning, somehow
    - even tribal societies passed down oral traditions of a
      beginning.
  - because the story of a beginning is itself a universal facet of
    human culture, then it itself is a symbol.
- calamitous events (Noah's Flood, etc)
  - Noah's Flood is a deep rooted architypical event which serves to
    provide each new generation with an understanding that humanity &
    civilization are impermanent. In the Judeo-Christian tradition,
    the story of Noah's Flood reminds us that we exist at the grace of
    God.

### Architypical Events/Phenomena in the Human Experience

- birth and death
  - everyone has a birth
  - everyone has a death
  - everyone can relate to these things
  - and ... everyone has a v-card
- hunger & thirst
- virginity (& purity)
- right and wrong

### Human Relationships (Family/Friendship)

- family relationships are shared by almost everyone.
  - lack of father/mother/parents produces some of the
    highest-magnitude shifts in a person's psychology
    - lack of presence or loss of a parent produces similarly dramatic
      shifts in a person's psychology
  - those relationships are at least known to everyone
    - father, mother, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, grandparents
    - they might mean different things to different people in various
      cultures, but the presence of these signs as mapple in terms of
      semiotics is universal
  - and family relationships are a set of symbols with profound
    strength.
    - even if someone is reading about the father/mother of Zeus or
      Persephone or Heracles, there is a subtle profundity influenced
      by factors such as family relationships which molds the lens
      through which we experience those stories

- perhaps distubingly, this is a set of symbols which could be erased!
  - think Brave New World, where children have state imposed family.
    - artificial reproduction supplants familial relationships of
      biological origin
  - Orwellian assaults on family are real. A tyrannical government
    will leap straight for the corrosion of the family as the
    strongest set of relationships in nearly every individual's life
    - this isn't new: it was life-as-usual in Greek Sparta
      - some Spartan's were separated from their family at birth and
        raised as ruthless soldiers
  - we are seeing this to some degree now and we need to be prepared
    because an overreaching government evolving towards tyranny *will*
    seek to undermine family.
    - it's not methodic or systematic now, but it very well could be.
    - God help us if we let tyrants get away with it!!

### Animals & Animal Behavior

- local fauna & their behaviors
  - global fauna

### Plant Life And Medicene

- local flora
  - global flora

#### Medical Uses, Geographic Distribution, Cultural Significance and Plant Interaction



#### Agriculture

### Psychology & Psychiatry

- in the case of modern society, psychology and psychiatry can be
  mapped in to a language.
  - this is really what the occult and system of magick were about.
  - creating systems that could map to features and phenomena in the
    human mind, in an attempt to control them.

### Weather Events

- rain, drought, etc
- these are less likely to be completely universal, but there
  presence/absence is mappable via semiotics.
  - and again, for millenia, people have reached for mythology as a
    means of explaining these phenomena.
    - even if they believed a myth about the Great Flood in the Epic
      of Gilgamesh to be false, they still derived useful information
      from mythology about that event or about flooding and how it
      could affect people
      - therefore a total assault on religion or an extinction of
        mythology/religion will lead to a humanity that is inherently
        less equipped to deal with life, people, cultures and events
        (common & rare)

### Medicine/Health/Disease/Anatomy

- disease is a cultural universal and beyond a threshold of
  intelligence, animals that must familiarize themselves with medicine

### Human Behavior

- emotions, emotional progressions
- eating, sex, things that every person must do
- passage of time: "Day"

### Misc Phenomena

... Everybody Poops

# Ragnarok

Still, Ragnarok is more than this (TODO: edit to update
connective). It is pre-literary futurism. It shows that the ancients
knew far more than they are given credit.  Ragnarok symbolizes the end
of the world as we know it. Like most other apocalypse myths from the
age of Pisces, the end of the world symbolizes the changes introduced
from exponential population growth.

During Ragnarok, the Norse Gods return one final time. In this myth,
Thor struggles against Jormungand, a snake streching around the
world. This snake is an Ouroborosian symbol, which is critical in
composing an interpretation of what Jormungand represents. Ouroboros
is a snake that grasps its own tail. It's a symbol found in many
esoteric traditions and one that represents a group dynamic where the
strong devour the weak for sustenance and to cleanse the group of
weakness. It's pretty evil.

###

However, theres another meaning to Jormungand, which lies closer to
another interpretation of Ouroboros: the global economy. But first, if
the snake has curled around the world, then it would be impossible for
the Nords to be unaware of the spherical shape of the world or at
least the possibility. And, as the stewards of Thule and Hyperboria,
*constantly travelling in and out of the Arctic Circle*, the Nords
were perhaps the people *most* aware of the spherical shape of the
world. The Nords were *well-versed in navigation* and *travelled from
close to the Arctic Circle to close the the equator. **It would be
impossible for the Nords to navigate their corner of earth while being
unaware of the spherical shape of the Earth**.

###

The previous sentence should be read as: if you know anything about
navigating with 15th century technology, Columbus was a cover story
for incidental genocide. The ignorance of Columbus is the greatest lie
of Western history. The degree to which this lie has been spread
through Western history tells you a lot about the quality and
trustworthiness of historical records themselves: they don't account
for secret and top secret information. Why would the West lie about
America and keep it secret from the time of
[St. Brendan the Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan)?
Because the West didn't want the rest of the world to know that North
America was ripe for the picking. Again, why? Because western maritime
navigability was inferior until the era before the Renaissance.

###

So... Columbus is a lie, partly to cover genocide. *WOOPS WE DIDN'T
MEAN TO!!* ... It was an "accident" and nothing more. Do you feel any
better? What about the rest of history? How many teachers in America
will look you in the eye and tell you the story of Columbus? So,
before this is all finished, the rest of the Illuminati's secrets will
be revealed. And no, this ain't no !@#$'ing Youtube documentary.

Talking about the Illuminati is a great way to immediately discredit
yourself, especially if you are correct. The "Illuminati" always knew
that the time would could when all their sins throughout history would
be out in open air in front of everyone. It's not like they didn't see
it coming. And it's not like they can't justify their dirty laundry:
they all know what they've done and they hate themselves for it. It's
a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.

Just to be clear: the Illuminati's guilt is an unfortunate dependency
of the stability of society. The only way for their sins to remain
undiscovered in a time of unprecedented free information exchange is
if they burn the whole system down, hording technology for themselves
for total dominance over mankind ad infinitum. Self-restraint is
appropriate when discussing the Illuminati because when you finally
realize how they work and how prevelant they are through society, you
will be terrified.

You can't learn about linguistics and semiotics without learning what
they have done with human culture, but you will never really know who
they are because they are everywhere. To most people, their level of
control over culture is unfathomable and appears supernatural. It is
not. The Illuminati are obsessed with knowing who is getting close to
being capable of learning or being dangerous. They watch certain
fields of knowledge. If you get close, they will insert themselves
into your life and co-opt your soul. They will choke you off first,
then try to buy you off, then try to destroy anything and everything
around you if you do not cooperate.

### Ragnarok Was Pre-Literary Futurism

- TODO: some of this is necessary as an example of well-architected
  cultural compression/archival through myth
  - but these ideas are terribly organized

The goal of Ragnarok was to preserve culture so that it could be
triggered later in an event-driven manner. The story is

IMO, when modernization threatens to homogenize all culture and
Jormungand symbolizes global trade. As Jormungand stretches across the
world, this represents fully globalized trade routes and the liquidity
that ebbing around the world.

A time when trade becomes global and when modernism threatens to
homogenize all culture.

  - the authors of Ragnarok wrote it down (in the Poetic Edda?) during
    a time of cultural turmoil
  - in other words, they knew their culture would disappear and that
    the Christian persecutions of western Europe would spread
    northward.
    - to some degree the most influential Nords may have been in
      agreement with utilizing Christianity to solidify Europe against
      Islam and any other major cultural movements from the Middle
      East.
    - these people were aware of Islam (again, they fought in the
      greatest road trip of the middle ages: the 2nd Crusades, circa
      end of 11th century)
      - they even brought back islamic jewelry from the middle east,
        which apparently baffled archaeologists for some time. there
        was a ring with arabic inscriptions found at a nordic burial
        site or something.

### Europe has always been obsessed with geopolitical cultural unity

- amoung others with political influence at the time -- think
  pre-Charlemagne Gaul (~7th century) through Medici Italy
  (15th century)
  - they would have been aware that, as long as Europe remained
    culturally united on the basis of Christianity, it would be much
    more capable of handling external threats, regardless of the
    consequences of internal conflict.
  - but the second that Islam crept in the back door (via
    people's minds, etc) and gained significant geopolitical
    foothold from within Europe, this would be a major
    problem.
    - this is because of the geopolitical and economic situation
      during the dark/middle ages: Europe's imports/exports were
      tightly coupled to trade in the middle east.
    - as long as Europe and the Middle East remained geographically
      and politically independent, that trade fostered prosperity in
      both Europe and the Middle East
      - but if either Europe or the Middle East were to obtain
        complete dominance over the region, that balanced &
        well-intentioned prosperity would give way to a system whereby
        either:
      - Europe becomes isolated & impovershed or the Middle East loses
        the ability to profit from Silk Road trade in its region
        - the entireity of 5,000 years of history can be accurately
          summarized by simply looking at the Silk Road, the economics
          of each region trading on it, and the politics of whoever
          controlled specific regions of it

### Neo-Ragnarok


- yggdrasil as a metaphor for traveling between planes
  - each world is its own plane



# Personal Understanding of Judeochristian Religions

(different title)

- literal/symbolic interpretations of bible

### Moses leading a slave revolt in Egypt


### Wandering in the desert

- galvanization of passionate, devoted followers
- crossovers to social physics & demographics

### Why The Hebrew Belief System Was So Different Than Others at the Time


### Why Monotheism Was Predestined, Given Only A Human Need for Religion To Explain The Unknowable

- monotheism was preordained by the complexity of information and the
  nature of how people internalize and process information
  - if you want something to be marketable, you make it simple
  - that makes any monotheistic religion fit tightly around the zenith
    of minimal complexity
    - everyone knows what the deity is
      - there is a clear single (albeit invisible) source of authority
      - no competition b/w temples
    - less for people to remember (at first)
    - faster to learn
    - simple creation myth (there was only one thing and everything
      came from that one thing)
      - a more predictable, more easily handled set of arguments to
        criticize it.
        - rebuttals to these arguments are easy to teach
        - these arguments/rebuttals are (nearly) completely enumerable
    - minimal amount of information for people to learn if they want
      to know who to love, fear, and obey


- belief systems are about evolutionary dynamics
  - but it's about propagating the
  - all of the above factors make monotheistic religions nearly
    inevitable, given a primordial soup of prehistoric religions
    - these spontaneously birthed traditions inculcated the tools of
      survival in children and adults from the moment that we knew to
      ask:
      - what is your name?
      - why is the sky blue?
      - where do the stars go and why does everything else change?
      - what is my purpose?
      - why doesn't Ug wake up?
    - a collection of information whose propagation was fueled by
      authority made apparent through implicit

    about phenomena



### Creation is inperfectable and as such is perfect

- on the surface, it is imperfect and inherently flawed
- but, in this way, our creator has given us a world that requires us
  to struggle hard in striving to improve this imperfectable creation
- we should be happy to believe in an all powerful creator and a
  perfect creation, but it is not so
  - however, in this way, we must evolve to become the strongest, most
    capable versions of ourselves
  - with the clearest vision of virtue, justice and creation

### Spear of Destiny

- spear of destiny as a metaphor for an alchemic process involving
  concentrated blame on one person as a scapegoated martyr who is
  punished
  - society is then able to opearte decoupled form guilt & un/knowingly
    free to continue utilizing unethical tactics to advance their cause
  - the person who compels their martyrdom wields the spear of destiny
- in doing so, they create a vortex-like torrent of karmic discord

### Splicing Families

- instead of viewing families as composed of ascending/descending
  trees of related individuals,
  - they can be viewed as intertwining trees forming an unevenly
    interwoven fabric where the individuals are like threads crossing
    over one another
  - or perhaps the families are threads & individuals are
    interconnected strands
- these threads can be woven together and spliced, which is rightfully
  frowned upon because it overall reduces the strength of the fabric
  - it is clear to see that cultural practices which are healthy
    encourage the strength of this fabric and the strength of the
    immediate family in relation to the individual
    - these cultural practices have an evolutionary dynamic that is
      sustainable and produces stronger people over time
