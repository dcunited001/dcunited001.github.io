- mention metaphysical precipitation

### All Warfare Is and Always Has Been Information Warfare



### How Is It Different Today?

- informational territory matters both more and less
  - it depends on what informational "territory" you are considering
    or seeking to control.
  - if you look at someone's individual social media feed/behavior, it
    changes rapidly, but only the most recent content is likely to
    affect a *real* person's behavior or ingestion of
    information.
    - automated agents can consume more information, analyze it &
      inform people with distilled analysis
    - fear and other sentiments of social groups or individuals can
      effect social media content generation on a wide scale
    - the presumption is that the information will be online forever,
      but this is not necessarily true.
      - the information must be accessable to be relevant
        - in "gray zone" operations against Ukraine, Russia has
          disabled power with cyber(?) operations, then conducting
          surgical military operations under a information blackout
        - in the digital age, people are fearful, vulnerable,
          manipulable, etc in an information blackout.
        - access to this information may be restored at a later time,
          or it could be conceivably lost forever.
        - it matters, but what matters most is how people act when
          they lose access to digital information.
          - during this time, their belief structures are more
            malleable. they are also stressed and more likely to
            cooperate with groups/forces they would otherwise reject
            outright.
            - yet, deceiving someone in this state only to have that
              group of people find out later will end up backfiring

- the dynamics and mechanics of information creation, storage,
  diffusion, persistence and elimination are being dramatically
  transformed month after month.
  - the only thing that is certain is that change is
    exponential. anyone dictating their policy with a static vision of
    the future will be blindsided. (their fortunes will be found in a
    future past)
  - what story will history tell about me and all the people like me?
    what do you actually plan on doing?

### Why Should We Be Worried?

- connect to the Communist Manifesto and describe how
  Bosheviks/Leninists operated to accelerate their communist
  revolution
  - lenin saw a problem inherent in Marxism, which was how the
    bougeousie could respond by simply improving the status of the
    people, while remaining in power
  - so, if one force or another gains too much influence in key
    departments or institutions, their

- all sociopolitical games are played like othello
  - the best moves have multiplicative or exponential effects
  - the best tactics and strategies can be deconstructed, so that they
    do not arouse the enemies awareness
    - therefore, it is best to capture sociohierarchical nodes that
      either don't appear to be subversively influenced or don't know
      that they are
      - how do you do this?
        - (1) manipulating the distribution of information
          - this is both paradoxically more and less centralized than
            at any point in history
            - we have many-to-many mass communication of news & media on
              social media. there seem to be fewer gatekeepers than
              ever.
            - at the same time, there *are* gatekeeping mechanisms,
              like control over algorithms (censoring words, people,
              ideas)
        - (2) inculcate new belief structures over time
          - you may not be able to predict how an individual responds,
            but it is much easier to predict how a *type* of person
            will respond
          - therefore, use your influence over media & dissemination
            over a long period of time to pursue branding strategies,
            marketing campaigns, etc
            - use this for "rhetorical engineering" to architect how
              people will argue about certain issues.
            - harness imaging/branding/etc. to create polarizing views
              on specific issues.
            - manipulate social media distribution algorithms to
              ensure that people are:
              - (a) increasingly polarized and bitterly divided by
                encouraging rhetoric/discussion on each side to use
                terms which are easily identified in online
                discussions
              - (b) identified into types by usage of
                sentiment-to-brand-identifiers in public social media
                posts
              - (c) divided into mostly separate online communities by
                hijacking feedback loops in social media algorithms
                - if they are in separate fb groups and bitterly
                  divided, they won't talk or hug it out, will they?
                - also, make sure that people can easily mute each
                  other, but not so easily see that person online
                  again.
        - (3) identify people who are either on your side or are
          susceptible to infleunce
          - again, use social media analysis or collect lists of
            people who attend community/activist events
            - find the people who are most passionate
          - mute people on the opposing sides by branding their cause
            or political party with something untouchable (like
            racism)
            - encourage your supporters to never refer to them by
              name, robbing them of identity. perhaps abuse national
              security (like DHS, etc) to actually legally gag them
        - (4) get your supporters higher up into social hierarchies,
          hide your supportors until the time is right...
          - influence them via information/disinformation. if you've
            analyzed their belief structures, then you know what will
            influence them
          - there will be some people who are like quasi-supporters,
            whom you can flip at any time by
            - (a) convincing them "if you can't beat us, join us" or
              "it's too late" or something similar
            - (b) rewarding them if they cooperate
            - (c) coercing them or threatening to replace them
        - (5) be prepared to clean up, by ensuring the pieces of your
          narrative are in place along the way.
          - operate slowly and carefully
          - then, the nodes that you flip will gravitate to the story
            they want to tell, that makes them feel beetter or that
            you want them to tell

- that is how the bolsheviks created networks under the nose of the
  Russian Tsars to gain enough power to act when they had the chance,
  ensuring that they executed a Leninist revolution: one that would
  not so simply be turned back or bought off

### Why Is Revolution Prohibitively Expensive in America?

- opportunity cost (america vs. a rising china)
  - we have what we need and little more than that
    - we are weak from about a century of prosperity
    - we are not wise and have a fickle memory
- it forces us to focus internally and expend "energy" and political
  capital.

# Qualities of Territory

- also, describe factors related to the consumption of information
  - attention is one loosely quantifyable factor and one that has
    inherent bottlenecks, as well as geospatial dynamics
  - attention, its geospatial and social aggregates, the direction &
    intentionality of attention

### Transiency

- nature of the territory implies it can be controlled for a certain
  (estimatable) amount of time before it is cycled
  - controlling a facebook page isn't that great, others can pop up
    and crowd out your space
    - thinking of the "territory" in social media conflict as a user's
      newsfeed is a much better equivalent
  - language changes. morphemes can be crowded out, words can be
    invented, zipf's distribution changes over time
  - semiotics also changes. signs can be remapped.
    - IP's change how we think of

### Risk And Opportunity Cost

### Costs And Gains

### (Functional Gains)

- the difficult-to-define functional gains from "owning" something
  - gains on economic capacity

### Narrative and (Capacity for Narration)

- what is the story?
  - e.g. how was this sociohierarchical role acquired? how was this
    image marketed/branded? how was this patent invented etc? how was
    this word created and why?

- what is the capacity to project information to/with/about the
  (territory)?
  - how does it augment your ability to influence informational
    dynamics?

# Five Types of Territory

- for the purposes of this article, the types of territory that will
  be examined is limited to four.
  - other additions can be imagined as well as reformulations into
    other categories

### (1) Informational Territory

### (2) Sociohierarchical Territory

### (3) Economic Territory

### (4) Physical Territory

### (5) (Mental/Subjective Experience) Territory

# (1) Informational Territory

- add wikipedia pages,

#### belief structures

- typology/transvaluation of beliefs forms the basis of everything
  your citizens belief
  - this determines your citizens habitual behaviors, how they will
    react, etc.
  - this is where demoralization starts.

- other non-physical spaces, reimagined as "territory"

#### semiotic/linguistic

#### intellectual property

- copyright/trademark
- patent

#### UX/UI aspects informational territory form a partial basis for "terrain types"

- just as terrain types can have important qualitative/quantitative
  differences, informational territory can also have these terrain
  types
  - there are major differences between the presentation/interactivity
    of webpages vs. facebook pages:
    - UI/UX concerns are different.
    - the networked-ness of the content is differnet
    - content ownership on facebook pages is determined by a
      consistent privacy/user agreement, whereas each website has its
      own content ownership and privacy agreements
    - generally interacting with a facebook page is a consistent more
      well-understood experience, the qualititaive and quantitative
      aspects of which are more likely acknowledged with consensus
      among your average user. that is, it's easier for people to form
      expectations about the UI/UX experience on a facebook page/group
      and the ripples that spread on the facebook network as a result
      of their interactions.
      - people also know that interactions on individual websites
        result in effects that are more constrained to that network or
        dotcom domain, whereas interactions with facebook groups/pages
        result in effects that ripple across the facebook content
        network (your interactions show up in your friends' newsfeeds
        etc.)
  - therefore, understanding the typological aspects of cyber
    "terrain-types" is critical to understanding the qualitative and
    quantitative results of your influence on any of those terrain
    types
    - each piece of cyber-terrain has a composition of higher-order
      terrain types. when projecting sociophysical influence onto
      these pieces of individual terrain, then it is critical one
      knows how the composition of higher-order types results in
      constraints on the space.
      - some of those higher-order types deal with the
        semantic/semiotic concerns of the space (i.e. the difference
        in a facebook page for lawnmowers, not sports cars vs the
        differences in a web-forums for lawnmowers/cars/etc)
      - these constrains on the space are essentially no different
        than the constraints on physical terrain, like higher-ground
        and lower-ground areas, albeit these cyber-terrains are
        high-dimensional, not euclidean and incredibly complicated
      - there are clearly "correct" and "incorrect" ideas to inform
        general tactics/strategies on these informational terrain
        types
    - the point is that if there is the higher-ground/lower-ground
      polarization for position, then identifying the higher-ground
      for informational tactics in cyberspace is critical.
      - once one moves past the subjective nature of the seemingly
        qualitative concerns, then you can generalize and inform your
        inforamtional operations by objectively understanding the
        "shapes" of these terrains.
        - for example, if you can funnel the enemy forces through a
          "ravine" in cyberspace like the Spartans did in Thermopylae,
          wouldn't you want to have that advantage, instead of
          completely blowing all your tactical advantages by arranging
          yourself without strategic implications in mind?
        - just as the shape of a ravine determines the shape of a
          creek's motion through it, the "shapes" of these
          cyber-terrains determine how sociophysical energy types will
          result in the motion of force across the territory
          - the point is to understand the space and terrain types, so
            that you can understand how to magnify your force where it
            matters, instead of blowing your sociophysical potential
            energy by allowing it to be dissipated
          - channel your sociophysical energy types, instead of
            allowing them to dissipate



#### Telecom/networking infrastructure

- this has more geographic trends
- signal bands as “territory type” in information warfare
  - more logically defined “spaces” in signal protocols (CDMA/TDMA)
  - FCC/military is already well aware of this

#### Spectral De/coherence

- how is this similar to the widespread sociohierarchical structural
  changes?
  - at the same time that

# (2) Sociohierarchical Territory

- how is it different today? where is it going?
  - {already discussed in draft on metaphysical-precipitation}
  - it is disappearing!!
    - as automation takes jobs/ & roles for bureaucrats, it means that
      the avialable nodes in social hierarchies are gradually/quickly
      eliminated
    - Sociohierarchically, we are evolving to the physical territory
      equivalent of Waterworld
      - so, in other words, keep expecting more Hunger Games
        shenanigans in local compeition at your business or region

#### Factors that Vary Between Types of Institutions

- difficulty in advancement, mobility
- significance and "well-definedness" of rank/position
- duty of rank/position



#### Types of Institutions

- types of institutions (need to think about these, some of them can
  be renamed ... refer to communist manifesto? that is a declaration
  of the ten types of sociohierarchical territory that must be
  controlled)
  - economic (businesses and trade institutions)
  - judicial
  - governmental
    - the specific seats and types of roles that politicians can fill
    - bureaucratic positions and roles
  - military
    - this is very difficult to get in to
      - it often requires truly heroic behavior that cannot be faked
        in order to advance in rank or to specific positions.
        - as in, commendable circumstances that are rewarded with
          medals.
        - a good example of such a circumstance is when Winston
          Churchill got lost in South Africa (i'll need to find a
          description of the events)
      - the difficulty to enter/advance in the military means that the
        hierarchy *should* withstand transient political changes
        - there are "office" politics and organizational politics, but
          rank/position are more scared than to be politicized by
          politicians or men without uniform
    - generals and higher-ranking officers are discouraged from
      political careers for ethical reasons. they are basically told:
      if you have this high-ranking position, we are giving it to you
      under the assumption that you are not seeking a political
      position, nor do you ever plan to
      - this doesn't mean that under all circumstances it is unethical
        for a high-ranking officer to pursue politics, but this is
        an emphasized policy in the military.
  - sociopolitical
    - moreso the other end of the political strata. from the
      grassroots and up
  - family/interpersonal
  - religious
  - non-profit
  - popular (community organizations, activist, meetups/etc)

# (3) Economic Territory

- capital flows
- intellectual property
- developing markets


# (4) Physical Territory

- expensive to maintain control over
  - can result in the development of negative narratives
  - can sometimes be more expensive to not control, especially in the
    long term

- gives you tremendous sway over informational, sociohierarchcical,
  and economic territory
  - but, abuse this, and the people who live there will remember
    - they may not power at the time, but they were there when you
      came and they will be there when you leave
    - exercise your power justly, with cause, responsibly and with all
      parties interests in mind and if you can convey that you did so
      to the people, they will also remember this

# (5) Mental/Experiential Territory

- this could be considered a subtype of Informational Territory, but
  it's fundamentally different, since our subjective experience of
  mind constructs our reality
  - this our last shred of privacy. the last piece of space on earth
    to be conquered is our mind/consciousness.
    - (this needs to be explained more clearly)
  - this is what hypnosis and psychological warfare is really
    encroaching on.
    - this territory describes the end-goal of any marketing strategy,
      propaganda technique, etc
    - the war is literally for your mind
- this should be distinguished from informational territory, which is
  concerned with language, ideas, words, literature, pop culture,
  telecom, etc
  - or places, forums & time/focus sinks in cyberspace ("places" you
    can move your awareness to)
- instead, this is the space constructed from what (SOF/AAF/PAF)
  entities have internalized. the (AAF/PAF) for now are basically
  informational territory
  - for now, there is something profoundly different from human/SOF
    experience. we can't clone ourselves somewhere or project our
    awareness to another body or another life
  - these psychological pricks are invading your personal space,
    projecting signal into whatever senses are available for input.
    - if they thought using your spincter for input in causal
      interactions, they would

# Tactics

#### Internet Content & Distribution

- SEO, URL's
- newsfeeds, social media accounts/pages, etc
  - newsfeed algorithms have channeled/corraled discussion into
    facebook groups & specific subreddits
    - these content distribution channels have mostly flat hierarchies
      - usually there are two strata: many users and a handful of
        admins. occasionally there are roles in between
      - the flat hierarchies with a greater than 100:1 proportion of
        users to admins means that a small number of users can
        dominate content moderation
      - on reddit, *THE WEBSITE THAT SHOULD BE PURGED FROM THE
        INTERNET*, the admins can censor by veto: if one moderator
        doesn't like your post or disagrees with it in any way, it's
        toast.
        - reddit hoards content created by its users, trying to
          maximize the network effect, but with the total exclusion of
          some users.
          - in my case, it wasn't just exclusion. i was targeted by
            leftists on other subreddits who labelled me as a "future
            mass shooter in a helicopter"
    - then these leftists act like they have the right to brainwash
      people into feeling shameful about trying to interact with other
      people "if they're not invited" so they can social engineer
      total dominance over IRL and virtual social interactions via
      abuse of mainstream media, which demoralizes the american
      population
      - the saul alinsky's of the world architect this utilitarian
        soulless shit to dominate & subjugate dissidents
      - thanks southpark "who invited mark zuckerburg here to our
        'community'"
        - fuck your 'community notifications' by the way and all the
          other shit that leads to iatrogenic interventions for
          yellow, orange, and red people.
    - btw, if it's not obvious, i fucking hate communists in america
      - look around. what kind of content and interactions are being
        policed?
        - why are religious discussions and socially conservative
          issues being constantly shamed and social "justiced"?

- now they're sorting/ranking notifications by importance...
  - it's a fantastic way to ensure that someone whose content is
    problematic is never seen when they reply to a post and especially
    a comment.

- NSA newsfeed drownout attacks on targeted individuals
  - can limit social media exposure of content from dissidents/etc,
    even when they are posting on other people's posts
    - this kind of technique would result in the effect where targeted
      individuals always appear to be the last person to comment on a
      thread
      - you can identify targeted individuals by tracking newsfeed
        rank over time for individual posts. all that is required is
        tracking the values multiplied to yield the newsfeed score for
        a single post can be plotted onto a dashboard.
        - newsfeed score ~= (U x V x X x Y x Z), where there are about
          five factors.
      - then, with these data points tracked over time, you can
        identify where and how they are running this newsfeed
        disruption technique on conservatives or on any targeted
        individuals.
        - basically, you use an effects-based approach: find the users
          with distributed content (i.e. posts, pictures, subthreads),
          where the score for the content always tanks immediately
          after the user interacts with it in a way that creates
          inbound links to their profile, identity, website
          - this is why i'm so fucking mad. I"M NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A
            GODDAMN NAME OR IDENTITY IN THIS COUNTRY"
            - anyone i interact with or any time i try to promote my
              content, it is considered dangerous BECAUSE IT LINKS
              INTO MY WEBSITE OR MY FACEBOOK PROFILE (i.e. my digital
              21st century identity)
            - but this is how you win at online marketing: you find
              new content on the top of the stack where people are
              actively engaged in it
              - then you engage in authentic dialogue (or whatever)
                and it creates inbound links to your content, your
                online identity, etc if you think about it in terms of
                21st century technology
              - i dont. i think of it in terms of time-series analysis
                and graph theory. the inboud edges that point to my
                identity or provoke reflection of my identity in the
                people engaged in the discussion lead them to think
                about me.
                - "they" would claim this sounds selfish or some
                  shit. but that's how society works. if you don't or
                  can't engage with people, people don't form memories
                  about you
                - i don't care about content online or any records of
                  digitized information in a computer.
                  - none of this matters. it is only useful in terms
                    of exploiting algorithms to escape these digital
                    and sociophysical jails that i'm in
                  - what fucking matters is making an impression in
                    someones MIND. what matters ultimately is leaving
                    residue in someone's fucking memories.
                - so, basically, you're saying that i'm not allowed to
                  engage in society. "they" would claim this
                  understanding of social interaction is utilitarian,
                  abstract, narcissistic, whatever
                  - FUCK THEM. they are the ones doing this to me,
                    ruining ever aspect of my life, confining me to
                    sociophysical jails, where i am subjected to
                    psychological torture wherever i go.
                  - so, in response to this, i've developed a
                    objectified understanding of socialphyisics IRL
                    and online, so that i can gamify everything.
                  - i don't give a shit about what they do to me or
                    what they say about me, because that poison-pen
                    information is already out there.

#### The Problems with Identifying Bots on Social Media

- up front: saying that there's no challenges in eliminating bots on
  social media is simply not true. it's very difficult. however, some
  aspects of it are easier than you'd think.
  - there are so many options to leverage to attack this that are
    dead-simple, it's incomprehensible that it's even an issue in the
    news. It's because everything in the media is a lie.

Identifying people with multiple accounts is trivial, unless they're
running through a botnet. Even then, all the activity requests use a
token session AND a key, which acts as the OAUTH application ID. So no
one can ever use social media in such a way, without having a botnet.
Any accounts which are truly fake are flagged as such immediately.
it's trivial to identify and prevent these bots, but they weren't
actually bots.

The point is: it's trivial to identify authentic interactions. the
positive analysis is easy, but the negative analysis is hard
(i.e. identifying bots and distinguishing them from automated accounts
with genuine value). This is certainly true because otherwise google's
dead-simple [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/) would
never work.

I'm really going off on a tangent here and i don't want to seem like
i'm focusing on you in particular, especially since you did so much
for me at the Colab. I need to write a draft on this anyways.

Another reason that Social Media and Google drop the ball on bot
identification is because the gray-market for #SEO allows their
products to form the basis of a platform. It's not that they can't do
it. It's that they don't want to do it for the same reason that no one
who invades Afghanistan wants to eradicate the heroin market. it's
simply ludicrous to eliminate bots: it's useful for anyone invested in
that gray market for social/financial purposes. It also sounds really
bad when your customer's accounts get flagged as bots and potentially
deleted. if Google, Facebook or Twitter were to eliminate that gray
market through brute force, they would lose customers and that former
gray market would gravitate towards a more friendly internet product
ecosystem: because people like a little piece of the pie themselves.

These internet billionaires are so fucking full of themselves, they
think that no one sees this through their counter-signalling
fairweather political operative smoke and mirrors.

#### Biometric Verification with Social Media

i am super excited about the face-identification on #iPhoneX because
it means social media interactions can't so easily be faked. anything
with headers coming from iPhone X on specific iOS applications can
almost guaranteed to be considered authentic, prioritizing that
traffic in rankings algorithms, at least when combined with a handful
of other signals. it's amazing.

the biometric validation of social media traffic may end up being one
of those funny future-past passé-faire ideas though, since AR/VR
interactions will overtake mobile after like 5 years.

#### Leveraging ad spots on free music/video for hypnosis

- because why the hell not? you don't have a soul and besides, these
  people you're targeting have no money, no options, etc. they're
  forced to use ad-supported free content.
  - every chance you get, you should be beaming shit into their skull
    until they are no longer functional except with expensive
    psychiatric care and then hey! -- your buddies in mental health
    get a payday.
    - one hand washes the factory farm sludge off the other, right?
  - for example, you could easily mutate audio streams of music to
    insert distortions halfway b/w audio artifacts and voices to make
    them go insane. again, why the fuck not?
    - this isn't just my hell.
    - {that's not what i'm experiencing btw}
      - it's just a really good idea for gaslighting, since these
        [Milgramian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)
        fucks want to be so good at it, why don't we let them live
        with that world?
  - this technology has non-tortuous uses by the way, but i can't
    really think about much else

#### Influencing the Leadership of

## Social Media Countertactics

#### Circumventing Shadowbanning

- filtered content w/ 'shadowlitsed' domain names or URLS in FB
  comments *may* be circumvented for content with 'shadowbanned' URLS
  by posting a facebook comment w/o it, waiting about (5 - 30) seconds
  and then editing the link in
  - this takes advantage of the immutability of stream processing
    data. at least, the content should initially proceed through the
    pipeline without being tanked for containing a 'shadowlisted'
    domain name.
  - post facto, the newsfeed algorithms *may* then take these URL's &
    etc into account, but a second event (the comment edit) now has to
    complicate the stream processing

- in large applications with mobile web access, these can be
  completely separate web application containers (e.g. m.facebook.com)
  - because of this, the networking pathway the m.facebook.com
    application container uses to communicate with newsfeed stream
    processing algorithm entry points *could* be different in some
    cases
  - logging into mobile web application servers could deliver a
    completely different *quality* of experience for users
    - in any case, the networking/devops architecture of these major
      web applications have serious design constraints.
    - understanding their architecture can allow you to discover when
      your newsfeed ranking is being tanked

#### To Identify Harassment

  - informal identification of those who are targeted to be muted
    online and, the application of their artificial attenuation of
    newsfeed posts towards the "enemy"
    - so, if you are being targeted, simply comment on the posts you
      don't want to see.

#### Spectral Identification

- they use monadic logic to communicate
- so watson/ai services can identify when there is a strong deviation
  from consistency in conversations & *especially archived
  conversations*
  - this is much more difficult to do now

#### Spectral identification of monadic logic

  - when specific unicode characters or keywords tag conversations,
    those are metasyntactic variables that help specify how a message
    should be transcribed
    - for example, when the unicode B (for blood type) is used, it
      signifies words which are covert up
    - these are wrapped in one more layers of monadic logic
    - however, since everyone in the adjacent thread know's what is
      going on -- and since the point is to inform people to not talk
      to others -- then some information can be extracted by an SOF
      entity with at least computational density of the human brain
      - and perhaps some information from that network
    - so. they are basically warning people "do not talk to the 🅱erson
      who will bring 🅱reat shame u🅱on your family."
  - in ASCII text, each character is like a frequency, so a high
    density of 🅱 correlates to a high frequency of people
    communicating using monadic logic. someone looking at those
    conversations could infer the individual who is intended to be or
    happens to be excluded/targeted.

#### Intentional, RANDOM Mimicry of Codes To Disrupt Protocols

- this unicode tagging tactic above is also susceptible to mimicry, so
  there would be many false positives.
  - *i crack codes for breakfast*
  - but another countertactic is to mimic the codes as soon as
    possible.
    - the WEAK & SLOW update channels for sociophysical "apps"
      requires that the protocols be flimsy and thin, so they can be
      digested by people NOT TRAINED IN INTELLIGENCE WORK.
      - this is terrifying: people who have no business working w/
        intelligence are risking their lives and being roped into
        programs so close to human slavery that i've been calling it
        human sharecropping
        - they simply have no choice. worse, it's being abused for
          extortion, racketeering, etc. etc
        - all the while, no one is able to ask the important
          questions
    - therefore, they are inherently susceptible to mimicry attacks
      - only a few records are being recorded. one of the purposes of
        their tactics is to ensure that a minimal historical record of
        events is recorded (SO IT CAN BE EASIER TO SCRUB & HIDE LATER)
        - they are trying to use fear to control people, so they don't
          create a high density of digital artifacts that counter the
          official narratives later on.
  - in order to influnece public life, these people have to signal
    over public channels.
    - since almost all communication by the public is constantly
      surveiled, this leaves a huge trail behind.
    - those using the signalling for intentional sociophysical
      incarceration must influence people in ways where it can be
      seen by many
    - they intend to project disinformation into the public
      consciousness
  - it's not possible to destroy/mutate all the archived social media
    content from the past decade.
    - i keep saying over and over and over again that these people
      will target the internet as a library of alexandria. they will
      burn it to the ground to cover up their sins, which they were
      always terrified would come to light
    - this must not be allowed to happen.

# Buridan's Ass

- structuring/assessing the incentives of groups, as to compel
  inaction with misinformation
  - #1 rule of life: know what you want, keep your eye on the ball and
    get what you want.
    - fickle people are susceptible to misinformation or changing
      circumstance.
  - Buridan's ass is how people controlled me with
    surveillance-informed iatrogenic "treatment" especially in 2015 &
    2016
    - they knew what I wanted and they knew how to suggest a new
      connection or get someone to say just the right thing at the
      right time, so that I would not leave Roanoke, VA
      - these connections were never meant to go anywhere. that's why
        I am so skeptical: "Show me the beef"
        - don't tell me about it. don't feign like it's going to
          happen bc I've been through that time and time again. give
          me something: social capital, etc etc
        - but i am not about to be led on endlessly b/w food an water
          like Buridan's Ass

- How to "Buridan's Ass" the groups in a political system for a
  political objective: a particular issue, a policy component or an
  entire policy
  - (1) ensure that both party's advance a political objective.
    - they can compromise or feign compromise on specific components
      of the objective.
    - this way, both parties contributed to the causal factors driving
      the change
  - (2) over the long-term, use marketing/branding to structure the
    language of the public's rhetoric and debate around a specific
    issue
  - (3) when/if one of the parties threatens to undermine a component
    of the political objective, ensure that the rhetoric/debate
    surrounding the issue implies a political capital lose for one or
    both parties.
    - this means the party that tries to regress on the issue loses
      political capital that outweighs what they gain by changing it
      - since the public conceptualizes the issue from within the
        frame established by the language of the rhetoric and/or
        debate, regress on this political objective or its components
        result in a net political capital loss
    - if both parties would lose political capital regressing on such
      an issue, then you have effectively created a "Buridan's Ass"
      situation using game theory
  - the a good example of this is the Marijuana legalization and
    prohibition.
    - the language of rhetoric and debate had always used terms and
      images like "Drug War" and "Legalization"
    - since both parties had worked so hard in the late 80's and
      throughout the 90's establishing this policy, then either party
      working to roll it back would lose political capital and lots of
      it.
      - change the language to "marijuana prohibition" which conjured
        associations to a policy taught in public schools as the
        "failure of alcohol prohibition" and suddenly the public's
        reaction to it changes.
  - these kinds of tactics for securing political objectives and
    locking in policy for both parties can be used for good or ill
    - however, it is certain that any democracy too fickle with policy
      and law will quickly find itself wasting its political energy
      and money.
      - we want healthy, honest debate and we want the public to
        decide. when they do, we want to build on top of a healthy
        system. from a architectual standpoint, we want that progress
        to be frustratingly slow sometimes for stability and
        longevity.
      - otherwise, if we make fickle changes, our citizens will lose
        confidence in the leaders and we will all be more susceptible
        to external influences.
  - with America's two-party system, this is different than it is for
    a pariamentary system. it's difficult to lock in progress and
    prohibit regress on an objective there are more than two groups.
    - even if it's a minor party, a more powerful political party can
      feign like they are compromising to gain the minor party's
      support in their coalition.
      - by regressing on components of the political objective or
        progressing components to some alternative objective
      - in this situation, the opportunity to feignt allows the more
        powerful parties to be more flexible, while casting the blame
        or cause on a minor party.
        - this allows them to be more flexible without sacrificing as
          much political capital as a major party in a presidential
          system

#### (original content on controlling through buridan's ass)

- exploiting buridan's principle
  - buridan's is pretty fucked up if you think about it
    - explain it in terms of operant conditioning for minimizing
      "movement" along high dimensional surfaces; stagnation of the
      mind's "gradient descent" via psychological reinforcement
  - explain the original aristotolean version
    - food & water, man's halfway between both.  but he STARVES every
      time.
      - this is because he will choose what he thinks he needs most:
        the water
    - eventually, this was "simplified" to having two identical
      objects: bales of hay
      - this sorta simplifies it, but also greatly changes the meaning
      - and it was changed by buridan to having an the "ass"
        representing a simpleton.
  - buridans is great because it exemplifies problems in our own
    systems of ethics
    - and exemplifies how knowledge of someone's system of ethics or
      belief systems can be used to stagnate that person
      - wow, that's really, really, fucking depressing
    - so, if it can be used for controlling people through their
      belief system
      - then it also speaks on the value of more-uniform belief
        systems
      - that is, if everyone has mostly random belief systems composed
        of a myriad of parent belief systems
        - then they are going to be a bit harder to systematically
          motivate
      - if the ability to systematically motivate people is valuable
        for whatever reasons (for evil or for good!)
        - then this speaks volumes on the value of systems for
          instilling similar belief & values systems
          - i.e. RELIGION
        - furthermore, if this ability to motivate others in this way
          is valuable and can be used for good or evil
          - then it must be guarded, so that it is available for good
      - systems of mass control are crucial for motivating people to
        pursue behavior
        - where the end goal of the behavior is moreso and indirect
          goal of their behavior
          - and perhaps the people participating in this behavior are
            not aware of the end goal of it at all
      - as evil as a system of mass control might sound, perhaps
        things like this aren't so bad
        - there are forces of evil at play in the world which can't be
          fought directly
        - by the way, this is where aristotle's politics and rhetoric
          come in to play
          - though i haven't read either, i'm just surmising from the
            themes of his Politics
          - it seems politics is a book about pursuing actions which
            obliquely support your group's agenda
      - ... phew i think i went a bit off topic there.
  - buridans variations - buridans awesome because you can easily
    variate it.
    - bales A & B.  ass equally distant.  ass already has bale C, you
      take bale C
    - one bale of hay is real and the other is fake, but the ass
      doesn't know which.
      - or doesn't know that one could be fake
    - buridan's + game theory.
      - example where two people are walking towards each other and
        need to decide who's going to move out of the way
    - or two planes flying towards each other and need to coordinate
      an action with limited time for communication
      - an action, where if they make a symmetric decision, will
        result in disaster
  - write about why it's important to make decisions ahead of time
    - and distribute decision making protocols ahead of time
    - this is important for distributed computer systems,
      - but also for people who may not be able to communicate
        efficiently, openly, etc
        - when needed to make a decision
    - there's a connection to category theory and monads here
    - is it possible for someone to innately contain all of this
      information
      - in otherwords , they have pre-decided on how to resolve every
        *kind* of decision they'll ever make
      - basically the ass has apriori knwoledge of every decision it
        will have to make
        - or at least every *kind* of decision
      - and isn't this what religion instills us with
        - early on, by studying religion, we equip ourselves with
          knowledge about situations
          - situations we haven't personally encountered and kinds of
            decisions we haven't made
        - this comes at the cost of freedom of choosing our own path
          and our own belief system
          - but it's just fucking useful to not have to expend the ti
            - to decide on every detail
