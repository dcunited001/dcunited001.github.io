### Normal Is No Longer What Normal Was

- normal is post-humous.
- it doesn't make sense to refer to "normal" in the 21st
  century. (doing so disregards what defines our generation's outlook
  on life). the only normal is the increasing pace of disrupted norms
  and (the vanishing semblance of any norm)
  - (... reword/etc

### Gossip Protocols

- stratification of nodes ranked by trust
  - propagation of argot/crytolect/slang info. metaprotocols for
    establishment and upkeep of cryptolects
  - gauging subnetworks where adversaries "climb up" to sources faster
    by laterally tweaking content of message distribution
  - throttling rhythm/speed of message propagation
    - how do nodes closer to sources exert influence on
      rhythm/speed/sparsity of distribution without direct contact?

#### Screwing with gossip protocols

- if you understand that particular connections are being used as part
  of some network's gossip protocol or happen to essentially be a
  group's unintentional gossip protocol, then they are fairly simple
  to influence: either to spread information or to tap into the
  information being disseminated.

#### Dual Argot Space of a Language

Dual argot space of a language (a kind of linguistic multilinear dual)
- the space of potential argots, and
- methods of "argotization" are not equivalent for languages
- expanding this space — particularly the grammatical/syntactical
  methods that cryptolects use, their ability to disperse their
  preservation through linguistic evolution — is a critical
  evolutionary advantage of langauges
- argots tend to arise around semoteleological pattern languages,
  where a key set of semiotic images & the relationships between them
  are preserved, while the argots surrounding them morph
- gossip protocols determine the dispersion characteristics for
  knowledge about an argot

#### The (Converse) of a Gossip Protocol: Epistemic/Doxastic Games To Erase Information

- Agents in a game who act to remove/cleanse knowledge from
  common/mutual knowledge sets.
  - The Agents who are aware of the game interact with agents who
    aren't aware of it; they gravitate towards the epistemic "scent"
    of information they seek to control.
  - Maintaining objectives of distribution freq. for specific pieces
    of info. There are some epistemic structures for which these
    agents intend to control the distribution: i.e. there should be
    some way to curtail the instances of these epistemic structures
    throughout the network.
    - IRL this game is even more complex because those structures
      indicate knowledge of the games of power or evidence of games of
      power. so, in the former case, this means agents who possess the
      knowledge represented by these structures are capable of
      behaviors/intentions that are difficult to define for agents who
      have never encountered them (esp. the agents who are not aware
      of the game)

### Was Steve Jobs a Shill?

- so, assume for a second that shadowy groups of people coordinate
  from behind the scenes for whatever reason; they're not connected
  and their incentives to collude arise from the terrrain of the
  collective unconscious, which funnels factors and decisions related
  to economics, knowledge and power.
  - now assume that these people have interests to protect and threats
    to protect them from, so -- without necessarily being aware of
    their their behavior being sync'd up or needing to communicat
    whatsoever -- those who advance their interests are rewarded, so
    long as the powers that be appear disconnected from how those
    interests are advanced; they respond to threats and dissidents by
    ripping them to pieces or gradually staining them with a kind of
    "taint" which is visible to society generally.
  - this would parallel the ideas of of "taint" discussed in [The Law
    is a White Dog](): It can be inherent as a result of lineage or
    upbringing, which was a basis for seeing whites as superior
    blacks, rationalizing slavery in 16th century Europe, albeit an
    ideological basis mostly unconscious except to those who plotted
    the system's establishment and who framed the intellectual
    motivations behind transgenerational reinforcement of racism; it
    parallels the examples of tainted nobles as traitors in
    post-Richard or Tudor England, to be deprived of all property;
    This can also be "taint" that is acquired as a result of social
    dispersion of information, where people whose statements or the
    rumors which follow them indicate taint that, in effect, is no
    different than markings on brightly colored poisonous frogs.

- the whole point of the above was to beg some very important
  questions about:
  - how does anyone ever play the game of life and win ... without
    selling their soul
  - once you have sold your soul, can you ever win?
  - if you've accumulated too much "taint" or sociophysical
    information that holds you back, robs you of opportunity and
    contorts people's interactions with you .. then can you ever hope
    to win?
    - or, in my case, can i ever hope to have a job outside of
      BestBuy? I mean really?
  - so, if such shady dealings must remain secret and you can curry
    favor with various secret societies by (...) then, do they
    exchange access to the more valuable opportunities to people who
    have gotten their hands dirty?
    - NO, that seems like a con that plays out like a bad joke. the
      grunt who gets their hand dirty loses the ability to become
      known, since the risk of damaging information would be magnified
      the grunt attained some position of power. if you choose to do
      fucked up things for powerful people, they will always control
      you with that information, unless you are very careful to
      proceed in such a way as to make everyone aware that NOTHING
      will ever emerge later on. it basically ensures that you will
      amount to nothing but a pawn in their eyes and the person who
      knows this and still plays the pawn is a spineless shit anyways.
      - all around, not the best way to curry favor *for yourself*.
      - however, consider the person who played the pawn, had
        children, family and friends, none of whom ever learned of the
        truth, even decades later.
      - the notion of "service" to the more powerful is respectable
        when you can openly talk about it, but not every secret is
        hidden for malicious reasons. so, for this person who served
        interests higher or lower, who couldn't say what they did or
        gained, it could be the risk of information exposure imply
        this person's opportunity for success is foregone. may their
        sons then reap the fruits of their favors? only time will tell
        whether secrets remain hidden.
    - people at the top are either aware or must remain unaware -- but
      if aware, you sure never hear about conspiracies or sheisty
      dealings of much truth. so either these are well covered up,
      securely orchestrated or they just don't happen.
    - those who are fortunate enough to attain some position of
      influence are just that -- lucky, perhaps in tandem with hard
      work and a few strings pulled here and there.
    - briefly assume there are shadowy brokers of positions of social
      influence: how would the economics work there? you would want to
      control access to as many positions of power as possible: for
      flexibility, for profit, for appearance of power to influence,
      for redundancy, and for options to influence and retaliate.
      - also, if you generally prevent individuals from accomplishing
        much of anything without serving you -- by preferring to hold
        opportunities for those who have served you, or those your
        network has vetted -- then people generally will be more
        likely to submit to your authority.
    - but what about some person who is never permitted to access
      sufficient opportunites to have financial or social independence
      whatsoever? how can they serve someone? can they flip a sign for
      Liberty Tax on a street corner? if they don't have a car, can
      they ever give someone a ride? if they don't have a home, can
      they ever let a friend crash at their place for a week? if they
      can't afford tools, what can they help build? if they don't have
      money, what can they loan or give?
      - by choking out threats -- or simply competition for your
        networks social resources -- then you ensure *they* have less
        to give to others. people gravitate towards social and
        financial resources. if by mandate, you can never accomplish
        anything but to get jobs where you are abused psychologically,
        then what can you EVER do for anyone else?
        - what does this do for society's social memory of you?
          there's not a single person that can remember how you've
          helped them. why? because you whole life was a fucking lie
          and no one understands that you have nothing because every
          opportunty, if it wasn't a setup, was quickly destroyed. no
          one knows what that feels like for you. they don't care
          because no one remembers you ... because no one reconnects
          to you ... because the social memory that has diffused into
          society is a twisted horrid mockery of the truth and **no
          one cares to see how your life was a meticulous lie, to
          create a monster or scapegoat to be destroyed in a
          spectacular trainwreck, so that you would be frozen into a
          cautionary tale that 5 years later, no one would ever
          remember.**

  - my whole argument: i became "tainted" by asking critical questions
    and for the past few years, this has reached critical
    mass. usually, there's some "truth" that the "powers that be"
    would *really, really* like to remain true, as it appears to the
    common person. Under no circumstances, do they ever want this to
    be questioned. This can related to government, policy, business
    model, intellectual property, trade secrets and countless other
    areas. It can even be information that is personal in nature, if
    that person for some reason has enough money & power to lash out
    at you.
    - Still, with today's increasingly disrupted economy, there are
      countless examples of someone's big corporation being disrupted
      into oblivion by some garage-startup!
    - So how the fuck did some guys in a garage manage to poke holes
      in someone's big bad business model without being squashed like
      bugs? I mean are Steve Jobs, Bill Gates or innovators like that
      even real? Or are they shills? Why did Nikola Tesla get squashed
      into poverty until the FBI killed in in 1943, sealing away all
      his intellectual property into the [Office of Alien Property
      Custodian](), for all we know never to be released?
    - If almost every person that challenges the status quo does so at
      some other interest's misfortune, then why doesn't everyone get
      squashed who is so far ahead in their field(s) that they are
      even capable of intelligently structuring questions which could
      potential disrupt someone's business model?
    - except those who sell their souls to become empty shills, if
      every person who is capable of innovation, disruption or
      critical insight ends up getting squashed by bigger, more
      powerful interests, then is Western World's economic progress
      since the Industrial Revolution just based on lie after lie
      after lie?
    - why the fuck does your probability of being squashed and ruined
      correspond hyperbolically with how developed your innate
      abilities are that give you well-rounded skill in innovation?
      e.g. The most complete definition of creativity I can think of:
      combinatorial reconstruction of phenomena in society to
      diffeomorphically expand on epistemological developments in
      knowledge?
      - it seeems like the very thing that makes people valuable and
        strong makes them worth destroying or stringing up like
        puppets.
    - so maybe its not this extreme. I do not believe it is
      coordinated or conscious retaliation, which is worse because it
      means these are just horrid socioeconomic consequence of endemic
      flaws of human behavior experienced at scale. The more people
      you have, the more power that powerful people can use to destroy
      anyone, whose strength or intellect is not some from innate
      genetic or cultural (source), but is merely a consequence of
      exposure to socially distributed information throughout life,
      causing someone to act on their hopes and dreams. So, the rich
      get richer ... yet, given that early 21st century innovation is
      systemically disruptive and we are close to economic
      convergence, aren't we getting closer to a period where there
      will be more disruption than ever? So why the hell does it seem
      so "normal" for someone like me to be so utterly destroyed? what
      the hell did I ever do that is so unlike what a Steve Jobs, a
      Bill Gates, a Neitzsche, a Tesla or any other heroes throughout
      history have done *when they build their life's work questioning
      things that escapes almost every person on the planet?* When
      doing so almost certainly necessarily disrupts things for
      someone else? How many souls did they buy and coerce to get
      their success?
  - My argument is not that I'm crying about a lack of success that
    can't be expected, but instead that *even trying* resulted in my
    life being so completely destroyed for reasons so *insipidly
    unnameable* ... When I did nothing but imitate people whose routes
    to success I studied, hoping that if my burning passion to
    innovate didn't get me a lottery ticket, I might have just shot
    for the moon to miss, becoming a star.
    - instead, it's fairly clear to me: no one will ever help me. no
      one will ever connect to me. my life is as close to
      **sociophysically zero** as one can get without waking up in the
      Mojave Desert, unable to remember the past three months with
      nothing but a bottle of sunscreen and a DVD copy of Memento the
      movie.
    - Shoot for the moon? And warp into some transplanar
      manisfestation of a Hell on Earth, where your torment is
      personally tailored to the pleasure of those who'd love to dance
      on you grave ... all because I had the intelligence to ask the
      kinds of questions which are necessary for innovation?
    - if this isn't level of Hell isn't some kind of torment that I
      deserve for being so bold as to think I might succeed with my
      soul in tact, then what did I do that is so unnameable?


#### Explaining the ....

  - (perhaps move this) if it's so crucial for the common person to
    remain unaware of any system, whether coordinated or the
    collectively unconscious result of groups (interacting with)
    social signals, occasionally with unbelievable feedback loops,
    then there must be some reason for all the secrecy. To be certain,
    it doesn't appear that there is any singular Illuminati or set of
    conspiratorial secret societies -- far worse, these are dynamics
    that result purely as a consequence of collective human behavior
    responding with varying degrees of consciousness to facets of the
    unconscious made conscious.
    - as social groups in competition become aware of needs, desires
      and objectives, then according to how individuals are
      distributed in a gradiation of consciousness to phenomena, each
      group responds to awareness of these needs, which are *usually*
      easier to obtain in competition if they remain unconscious.
      Since every person begins life almost completely *tabula rasa*,
      then with respect to almost every phenomena, they are completely
      unconscious and will rise in society's gradiation of
      consciousness as they encounter socially available information.
      Factions can cooperate, but one aspect of nearly every game
      theory scenario is universally true: it is easier to control the
      outcomes when you can control information distribution. More
      precisely, by limiting the spread of nearly any information by
      default, then for some competitive domain, it is advantageous to
      systematically control the [spatial complexity]() of statistical
      models by tending to constrain the dispersion of relevent
      information. Though there are some exceptions, people are more
      predictable when they have less information. The leaders filling
      various roles in cooperating factions, however, are not useful
      without the requisite information to interface with the social
      system to win the game.

#### What has this "Taint" been like for me?

  - What has it been like for me? Every new acquaintance you make:
    initially they're warm and receptive, then neutral and
    apprehensive; finally vaporous and dispersivel, usually after the
    third time meeting them. You're never invited in and usually
    arrive when people leave. People configure themselves so they
    remain functionally distant from you, along various sociophysical
    metrics like seating arrangement, physical orientation, etc. In
    terms of social valence, you're like a Nobel gas and nothing has
    compatible valence to bind to you. At the same time, if you are
    socially weak, you may not know what to do.  Dementors bind you
    down to scrutible predictability in poverty with minimal options,
    intending to stagnate your psychological development by limiting
    access to any social experience (since development impairs
    predictability), then if you can even assess sociophysical metrics
    -- and manage to clearly state them without being vulnerable to
    derision by imps who are have created your circumstances, while
    intending to throw you in a sanitarium -- then people still move
    away from you. Why? First, the successful should tend to avoid the
    unfortunate, as dictated to the soulless by the 48 Laws of
    Power. Moreover, if your apprehension of a Rumor Mill staffed 24/7
    by entities from Hegel's nightmares is not a slow-cooking crock of
    crazy, then illusions surrounding the fallacious torment of your
    life are easier to see and discuss from the outside looking in. If
    there reallly is some intent to isolate you from any who may aid,
    abet or use a targeted individual, where the fate is the same for
    anyone who intervenes, then to prevent anyone from being the "good
    person" that so many unfortunate schmucks in humanity are wont to
    do, the illusions to those on the outside are rendered slightly
    easier to see. The goal is to deprive you of financial
    independence, then social independence and finally informational
    independence; the last being induced once you are swimming in a
    sea of lies with not a soul to reach in and tell you so much as
    "Hey buddy, your shoes are untied. If I was you, I wouldn't want
    to trip up on my face" ... or "Hey dumbass, you might want leave
    the country or at least get a lawyer." ... or "Give up, there's no
    hope, your life is a lie; you also might want to find friends less
    interested in gaslighting you." The intent is to deprive you of
    all options, not only rendering you predictable, but more likely
    to reach for help from people that you never, ever should have
    trusted. With no social experience, you can be emotionally
    harassed to almost guarantee that you'll never have the
    wherewithall to positively adapt or develop new behaviors: AND IN
    HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING, STATISTICALLY, YOUR MODEL FOR A PERSON
    MUST BE COMPLETELY RECONSTRUCTED WHEN THEY DEVELOP SUFFICIENTLY
    NEW BEHAVIORS AND HABITS.
    - If all or some of this is actually true, what does this all
      mean? Your life is a fucking lie and every person knows it: they
      can see through what's happening, but if they want to help you,
      they have to dampen any visible signs of *hoping* to ever do so.
      This seems to be what motivated a handful of the most tragic
      expressions I've ever seen: usually from an old friend when they
      didn't expect to see me. It was a split second of a specific
      kind of confliction: as the expression of their recognition of
      me developed from unconscious to subconscious, they
      simultaneously presented extreme hope, sadness, fear and love,
      each pulling the person's body language and thought in different
      directions, like they wanted to reach out and hug me, but
      weren't sure if they could run away without hurting me, since
      they acknowledged my isolation.
      - My personal response to these kinds of expressions? It was
        similarly conflicted, though usually my response to the
        expression with anomolously modular confliction took time to
        grow. In retrospect, these are moments where I felt like I had
        seen more truth than I had for months and I felt symmetry,
        honesty, love, authenticity and fear. In the end, I felt
        mostly love and fear. Fear: that I had seen the effect of
        power know one felt surmountable to ever relay to me and how
        could any fear be so authentic, so instant, but unnameable?
        And love: that despite all that power to instill fear, all to
        isolate me for unspeakable sins against it, there was nothing
        it could do about truth. The truth of moments like that, would
        be redeeming and renewing, since without the need whatsoever
        for words, I remembered that everything else had been an
        illusion: no one hated me or, at least, the people who had
        known the real me recognized truth and never stopped loving
        me.
    - It could be said: you're crazy or you couldn't possibly know
      that's what they were thinking. Fair. Still, if everyone in
      society reacts to information about you, the origins of which
      you can't trace that seems to globally impact the decisions,
      then how do you distinguish what is "normal" when you only ever
      experience life from you own perspective. If society at large
      has pulled the wool over your eyes and you feel the need to
      reach for such colorful language as "dementors from Hegel's
      nightmares -- who are responsible contorting everyone's
      conception of you until you never feel love, but only the
      auto-informational echo of ruminating on emotional trauma in
      solitary confinement", and it then turns out that you can
      provably confirm many of your suspicions (that people close to
      you intend you to tread delusionally in a sea of lies to
      gaslight you, while you speak to no one who could shatter those
      illusions), THEN HOW CAN YOU DISTINGUISH NORMAL SOCIAL DYNAMICS
      FROM THE HELL THAT IS YOUR LIFE? What is normal and what is
      exceptional? All I know is that there were a few moments like
      that, where the illusion was broken, often by such means that
      couldn't be relayed in words alone, *since surveillance not only
      informs my victimizers with how to gaslight me, but also to
      discover who should be retaliated against, were I to ever reveal
      names of people who had even unintentionally given me a damn
      clue! Is it no wonder that I see the tragic confliction of love
      and fear ripping people in multiple directions at once?
      Physically, causing their body language to physically move in
      directions counter to it's several directions: the head's change
      in orientation, the upper torso, the shifting of weight planted
      in the feet and most of all, the eyes, all moving incoherently
      as though cognitive processes overdriven need to recollect
      divergent threads from the subconscious reacting to the
      unconscious needs suddenly made manifest. Each of these is a
      potential signal: though easy to misread can usually lead you in
      the right direction.



    - [The Law is a White Dog](): BY THE WAY, READ THAT FUCKING BOOK!
      SLOWLY AND MAKE SURE YOU ABSORB EVERY FUCKING SENTENCE BECAUSE
      IT WAS WRITTEN SO THAT IT WOULD SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS. It's
      crafty use of language and prose disguises its message. It's
      masterfully written non-fiction prose.  -

======

- while i believe people are still inherently good, as is society, it
  would seem that evil people, implicity, are typically conscious of a
  broader range of phenomenona than good people. to be good at being
  evil, you have to be more in tune with social information to analyze
  it for signals you can use for deception, malicious behavior, etc.
  - consequentially, by zooming out to consider power dynamics in
    groups of people with varying levels of consciousness, then evil
    would tend to outcompete good in social hierarchies, absent some
    social self-regulation of amoral exploitation -- i.e. law or
    religion.
  - (these modes of self-regulation actually tend to be pretty strong,
    as they need to be... etc, etc, they encode idealized virtues,
    etc)

- the emanation of "shadow-egregores"
  - segue into this

- religion as the spectral harmonization of shadow-egregores emanated
  from the unconscious aspects of psychology/sociology/economics
  - why such spectral harmonization is critical to simplifying the
    possibility space and making sense of humanity, society and our
    direction forward. without this spectral harmonization, modeling
    individual and social behavior is far more intractible.

### Molding/Disrupting Social Consensus of Worldview

- consider paths of worldview evolution (context: socio-informational
  conflict)
  - consider components of a worldview, diffeomorphicly
    - how can componets of worldview with social consensus be changed?
    - what components are flexible enough to be changed?
    - which components are advantageous to change to decouple dynamics
      which tend to fasten the social consensus of the worldview?

### Terminology & Definitions

- Consensus Reality
  - equate, differentiate from, and clarify the following
    - epistemic structure
    - information system and the structures thereof

- delineate typological/ontological and replace where necessary

- socioepistemic schism
  - distinguish/dilineate from the following
    - socioepistemic confict (whereof shism is a large-scale example)
    - conflict of social information systems
  - rename "socioepistemic structures" to simply "socioepistemics"

- "moral panic"

- socioinformational
  - generally update "socially distributed X" with "socio-X"

- change socioepistemological => socioepistemic (done)

- ensure noumenological and phenomenological are clarified
  - for the definitions of epistemic structures and the social clarity
    thereof, how do they arise and how are they inculcated: fron the
    noumenaological or phenomenological?

- in relation to the "Chomsky's going to love this" section,
  - where should the establishment of "Social information Consensus"
    and "socioepistemic/semioteleological decidability" be placed?"
  - how does all of this correlate to the section on "semantic
    triangulation?"
    - is this a good place to segue into "Semantic hendiadys"
  - section on "Semioteleological: What Does That Word Even Mean?"
    comes far too late. As well as the section on "Godel's
    Incompleteness Theorum and Semioteleological Decidability"
  - everything afterword should be re-evaluated

- i really need to settle on a consistent set of terms for describing
  the parts of this "nietzschean" system
  - for creating a bridge to the ubermensche
    - (an asymptotic goal which cannot be obtained)

- "pied piper" and information's effect on micro/macro group dynamics
  - relate the story to points about the resonance of information,
    epecially when amplified & constructively in phase
  - how do people react to these signals? collectively? individually?
  - why do some topics foment harmonization in "topics of interest"?

![Epistemicide](epistemicide.jpg)

- how to reorganize the concepts before the ToC below?
  - to maintain continuity, while captivating attention


### (Dominance over the) Metaphysical

- why do powers want to control socioepistemics
    - where to initially define socioepistemics/etc

### Social Information Consensus

- social information consensus (& dynamics thereof) as it relates to:
  - whether information systems are overdetermined/underdetermined
  - validation/assumptions of consensus/coherence among social nodes
    - do social nodes realize that information systems:
      - have reached social consensus
      - could/not reach social consensus
      - are likely to seem overdetermined/underdetermined amongst
        social nodes
    - i.e. "when we all know that *what we all know* means there are 3
      different ways to verify some pieces of information"
      - when this is true, the information has propagated through the
        network and some means of validation are readily available --
        *and everyone knows that*
        - the system can be said to be overdetermined
        - but in this case, information related to (and along the
          boundary of) the socially distributed information system in
          question is:
          - more rigid and less susceptible to sudden change
          - if the system does change, everyone involved can
            anticipate how it will change.
       - however, when the social distribution of some information
         system is curtailed, constrained or simply doesn't propagate,
         then the system's pieces are poorly socially distributed.
         - it is underdetermined: and everyone knows that the related
           information
         - it is thus more flexible, more susceptible to change that
           is difficult to anticipate.
       - when seeking consensus or verification of the coherence of
         information, if the system as it is distributed socially is
         underdetermined, people might find themselves saying:
         - "i don't even know what questions to ask" as though they
           aren't sure how to extrapolate along the boundary of the
           information system

### Projecting information to maintain Determined-ness of information systems

  - when aniticipating change of an information system to retain
    flexibility, it is generally more advantageous that the system is
    underdetermined, specifically in how it appears to specific people
    or types of people
    - i.e. when you are pulling the wool over someone's eyes, you
      don't want specific pieces of information to be readily
      available to them.
      - or the ways the information system can be adapted are limited
        - this means there are fewer believable lies that you can tell
          them.
        - or, if you are using the tactic of creating truthful
          disinformation, it becomes harder to fake consistency to
          deceive the person.

### sociopolitical conflict and the influence of information-diffusion on determined-ness

- in sociopolitical conflict, there are powers with varying degrees of
  dominance, from full blown monopolar or shared, bipolar hegomony to
  submission to such dominant powers.
  - For the more dominant powers, how can their extreme share of power
    be regarded as certain, by themselves and by others?
  - it is critical for the dominant powers themselves -- and for those
    lesser powers within their spheres of influence -- to feel certain
    about their power.
    - uncertain situations cannot be extrapolated for anyone
      involved. this inherently leads to miscalculation for those who
      cannot determine the certainty of key components of the
      sociopolitical status quo.
      - that is, those powers major and minor whose world-view is
        certain will pursue actions, tactics and strategies whereby
        the impacts are assumed to be certain and known -- by the
        acting powers themselves as well as those who must ascertain
        the consequences.
      - however, especially for minor powers, when actors take actions
        in generally underdetermined situations, they have no hope of
        understanding the consequences. at best, the actors
        misunderstand their own actions. worse, those actors cannot
        extrapolate the consequences when their (status) is influenced
        by these actions in terse-yet-underdetermined sociopolitical
        situations

  - so, sociopolitically, controlling the inferences and
    extrapolations made into socially distributed information systems
    is critical for maintaining power. there are those information
    systems which dominant and non-dominant powers want to be the
    truth, (unchallenged) and insurmountably unchallengable. that is,
    the facts and assumed facts of these information systems cannot
    change and lay the groundwork for the worldviews of individuals
    and groups.
    - yet there are also information systems which some powers want to
      remain

### Complexity of Social Information Systems and Decidability

- there is no objective truth an any information system, regardless of
  how knowable and certain some fact or theorum may seem, there are
  axioms whose truth cannot be interrogated or demostrated.
- yet, the perception of change and of the possibility of change has
  wide-reaching sociopolitical impacts.
  - how do individuals reach concensus on the facts of history or
    science? (history leads individuals to want action, to feel the
    need for action, to feel that action is hopeless or pointless)
  - determining which truths that individuals and groups ascertain to
    be constants in the narratives of history, determines their
    resulting (aggregate) (decision-tree) choices in the
    (decision-forests).
    - regardless of the structure of those decision-trees, either
      individual or shared, if you control the input or apparent
      input, you can exhibit significant influence on the output.

- what is the "input" to these individuals and groups with agency?
  - how do we decide what a word means? do we all have identical
    conceptions for the meanings of words? absolutely not. so, beneath
    the surface of these (decision-forests... drop the metaphor?) are
    the the systems of categorizing and "typifying" input: the systems
    of linguistics and semiotics.
  - individuals and groups all share systems of classifying (input
    related to conceptions and abstractions), but there are important
    distinctions amoung these distributed systems of
    abstraction-classification:
    - languages have dialects, but also have cryptolects.
      - some groups develop argots, "trap-door" type abstractions
        within a single language or a language pair
    - mythologies inculcate semioteleological mappings within the
      people for which they are distributed.
    - there are cultural universals, but each one has various
      implementations in every culture.
    - there are tightly connected cultures and broadly connected
      cultures
  - for any of those mechanisms for parsing linguisitic/semiotic
    input, any change to those strucutures represents change to
    distributed/connected groups across a region or across the world.
    - changes to some structures propagate the impact to social groups
      more quickly and with more certainty than others. people must
      consume information related to these structural changes in order
      to exhibit changes in the decisions that they make.
    - but perhaps the most important question here is: how can we know
      how other individuals and groups classify linguisitic and
      semioteliological input?
      - can we ever know that with deterministic certainty?
      - can we ever know with deterministic certainty that an AI
        trained on linguistic data will classify words identically?
        - no, we can only know with certainty that, if the trained
          weights and structure of the AI's network vary, then so will
          the outputs of that network.
      - so if even language and semioteleological mappings cannot be
        said to be determinstic, what is the range of confidence we
        can have in deciding how some other entity, whether an
        individual or group, will have in classifying linguistic and
        semiotic input?
      - obviously there must be some variance in confidence here:
        languages are shared abstractions and that humans propagate
        abstraction is itself the primary distinguishing trait between
        the minds of humans and animals.
        - in order to have any confidence herein -- and for language
          itself to have the benefit that guarantees its continued
          propagation -- there must be distributed abstractions for
          semioteleological classification whose mappings are similar.
        - so there is variance and similarity amongst socially
          distributed abstractions: and thereby, we have varying
          levels of confidence with regard to the clarity of
          communication.

### Semioteleology and information systems

- (segue? from complexity of social... ?)
- therefore, there is a problem of decidability in probabilistic,
  semioteleolgical system.
  - decidibility in computer science, for deterministic programs
  - how does is this concept different for non-deterministic systems?
  - the important point herein is: how does the assumed decidability
    and perceived decidability (as a result of communication) relate
    to the certainty, persistence and implications of information
    systems.

- it's sociopolitically relevant to understand how ideas,
  abstractions, language changes over time. because the extrapolated
  calculations of individuals and groups will change if language and
  the distributed semioteleological mappings shift beneath our feet.
  - how do people determine what is relevant or what is true?
  - if specific information systems -- e.g. historical narratives --
    yield the gradual inculcation of shared decision trees and thereby
    encourage or constrain specific actions by those individuals and
    groups,
  - then if those information systems and the semioteleological
    mappings that (assign meaning to semiotic sign) change, then so
    will the extrapolated actions and perceived extrapolation of the
    impact of actions.
  - basically, if fake news undermines the mappings, context and
    confidence related to information systems and the decisions we
    make based on the socially distributed information that we know
    and upon which we choose to focus, then the implications of
    seemingly rock-solid information systems can shift beneath our
    feet, yield conflict and other consequences..

#### What does decidability mean for Sociology and Communication

- The process of information consensus and complexity of Information
  State-Space -- how do these relate to the notions of decidibility in
  social information systems?
  - introduce slang as an example: how does it propagate? what
    determines the selection/retention of morphemes with duplicitous
    connotation?
    - decidibility problems in slang usage
  - how does this apply to the notion of pattern langauges? how much
    additional structure can be imposed onto language/communication?
    - when words/concepts are remapped with too much complexity, no
      one knows what you mean or which direction you're coming from or
      which side you're on.
    - this isn't cogent to a discussion on slang because that's
      developed ad hoc. it's more important to the examination of
      argots/cryptolects as they are used for the advancement of
      political agendas and for belligerence in society.

#### Assertion: ANY Assumptions reduce the complexity of the informational state space

- better term for "assumptions"
- this assertion must be qualified by:
  - validity of the assumption
  - ethics of the assumption
  - efficiency/utility of the assumption
  - [informational parity] of the assumption
    - i.e. is the structure of the assumption clear, simple and
      definite? does it require parameterization?

#### Correlate to the "Triumvirate" framework for delineating governmental/social systems

- in the more extreme configuratoins of governmental systems, the
  influential tend to:
  - (1) construct abstractions (and socially distribute them) so that
    specific concepts are clearly defined and so people in society can
    predicate their actions/statements/beliefs upon these
    abstractions/assumptions
  - (2) leverage tradition (either old or new) and generally socially
    engineer.
    - this is effective by reducing the informational/schematic
      complexity
  - (3) concentrate the majority of info/schema into highly focused
    spectra. they try to force beliefs upon society

### Decidability & Schematic Complexity complicates a society's reflection upon:

- (1) that society in relation to itself
- (2) that society in relation to the external
  - this is particularly problematic when the society cannot fathom
    the nature/state of external factors, as they relate to its
    prosperity or demise

- that is, as the complexity of information systems expand, the
  ability for a society's leaders and individuals to quickly make
  decisions that are effective and serve the interests of the general
  public begins to break down.


### Concept of Elasticity, as applied to Social Information Systems

- as the motion is more generally defined in math, what is elasticity?
  - what does this mean for the social distribution of information?
  - how does this relate to the distribution of attention and the
    absorption/retention of information?

### The Socially Unconscious Impact of Unstated Objectives in Informational Conflict

- people have intent as to the distortions/mutations of social
  informational systems that will lead to ideated, reified components
  of socioinformational systems.
  - They will often resort to lies to achieve these informational
    ends, since they assume that the behavior of individuals within
    some social situation is bound to the information those
    individuals process.
    - therefore, model some individuals decision-making processes,
      distort the information available to them, seal away the
      informational alternatives from the social context, and if your
      models are accurate, people will make decisions and take actions
      that you predict.
    - but, in order for any of this to work, you have to ensure that
      all information available in that social context is
      compartmentalized by default and that there is no totally free
      exchange of information: in other words, you don't want a bull
      in a china shop because that bull is going to break all of your
      precious socioinformational compartmentalization.

#### But The Truth Will Set You Free

-(cont. from above)
- these people that work tirelessly towards the maintainence of their
  socioinformational compartmentalization become slaves to their
  all-but-socially-unconscious informational objectives:
  - their distortions, their omissions, their outright lies.
- they lose themselves to the maintainence and upkeep of the
  misinformation, which they ascertain will cause other individuals in
  the social context to act in service of their goals.
  - In much the same way that their models of individual's socially
    relevent re/actions are useful for prediction, they themselves
    become almost-deterministically *programmed* by their intended
    distortions, which remain as socially unconscious influences to
    everyone else.
  - In this way, they become slaves to the service of the
    misinformation they believe will cause others in their social
    domain to unconsciously bend to their will. For, even if the
    impact of their informational objectives remains compartmentalized
    within the individuals who wake up to the misinformation (and
    thus, social participants remain individually conscious and
    socially unconscious), then, so long as the promulgators of such
    misinformation themselves remain socially unconscious of select
    individuals newfound cognizance, then they themselves will remain
    predictably in service of said misinformation.
  - Like objects in motion, with no forces acting on them to impact
    their momentum, these liars and half-liars will continue drifting
    along such a requisite trajectory as is determined by their need
    to deviate from the truth or act as truth's artificers via
    outright fabrication of information, for however long they
    continue to believe such informational distorions will service
    their ends. Why wake them up? But why place such a game at all,
    when the truth is on your side?
  - so, basically, as long as you don't burst their bubble and so long
    as they don't become cognizant to your cognizance, then you can
    manipulate them with their very own attempts to manipulate you and
    the others around you with misinformation. for they will continue
    to chase their own goals of fabricating and unveiling the
    information they require to pursue their objectives. if you are
    successful in such a regard, they are actively and intentionally
    the liars and fabricators, who might have the upper hand at the
    moment, but whose reliance on information artifice will drain them.
  - however, if you or these people were strong enough to have no need
    for falsehood or artificially fabricated information, then you
    would be free from the need to chase such informational
    objectives. Thus, it is the truth that sets you free because the
    truth is what it is and needs no such upkeep.

#### "All Roads Lead To Rome"

- an example of the above: when someone has a need to paint a target
  as crazy, then in almost any situation or component of a situation
  handed to them they will seek to remap it to their own ends
  - the usage of the word "remap" is intended to evoke undertones
    involving category theory.
- they need to discredit you and want to do so by having everyone the
  target comes into contact with believe that he/she is mentally
  unstable and/or insane,
  - so, while they will avoid moving towards the objective when doing
    so would precipitate conflict, any time they can get away with it,
    they will generally nudge individuals towards consuming the belief
    that the target is insane

#### Intended Compaction/Embedding/Compartmentalization of Socioinformational Diffusion



- (socioinformational) aetiology

### Epistemic Mitosis

- epistemic mitosis
  - and meiosis (for the sexual-recombination of ideas)
  - as it relates to the reproduction/propagation of epistemic
    structures through society

### Epistemicide

  - the systematic destruction of information structures deemed
    heretical. the eradication or culling of instantiations of
    forbidden knowledge in society.
  - the modulation of epistemic propagation by the modulation of
    attention/focus. i.e. the attenuation of informational spectra,
    relating to the aggregate of attention to socioepistemics

#### Evolution of Epistemic Structures

- evolutionary dynamics and speciation in epistemic structures
  - entropy/enthalpy in the evolution/distribution of epistemic
    structures, for types/metatypes. the potential for diversity in
    epistemic structures is balanced by the influence of enthalpy on
    the speciation of information as it propagates.

#### How Social Information Consensus is useful

- social information censensus and the effects its outcomes can have
  on people's lives.
  - those with social/financial resources have the upper hand when
    provoking/manipulating information consensus.
    - the outcome of information consensus can impact your ability to
      secure social/financial resources in the future
    - how can informational resources be utilized to affect/predict
      information consensus?
  - once a consensus has been established and distributed, it becomes
    difficult to overturn. for every instantiation of the information,
    the vessel of that information needs to choose to modify their
    beliefs (or store information in the case of social media &
    digitized information)

#### Bilingual Readings for eludication of epistemic meaning via Semantic Hendiadys

- leveraging bilingual readings for a kind of semantic hendiadys.
  - concerning epistemic convolution: reachiing the authentic semantic
    intent of an author by attempting to find the middle ground
    between two transations.

#### Liberation from Sociophysical Constraints

- if you seek true liberation and other people subsist by siphoning
  your sociophysical resources -- i.e. they take the value work they
  underpay you for, or they plan on deciving you to manipulate you to
  gain sociophysical influence -- then your liberation is expensive to
  their sociophysical potential energy.
  - your cage is not made of steel: there is no physical lock. you
    might spend your entire life looking for a physical key, but there
    is no key in the outside world. this is a fool's errand. the keys
    to your liberation come from within.
  - if you understood the structure of your own cage and freed
    yourself, they would no longer be able to use you. or they'd no
    longer be able to siphon quite as much energy from you. so, when
    this liberation happens on a social scale, it terrifies the
    parasites that completely subsist on the efforts of others.
    - not all people who occupy higher strata in social hierarchies
      qualify as parasites. it really depends on how much value they
      contribute to society and how much blood they suck. obviously,
      so hierarchy and structure in society is unavoidable; managers
      and people with authority are a necessary evil.
    - yet, quite a few high-ranking people in the high-classes subsist
      unfairly on value derived by those toiling below them. as for
      those people whose livelihoods depends not on hard-work but on
      precariously maintained deception, their lives are ironically
      less secure than that of the common person and the honest
      person.
      - their livelihoods depend on projecting deception -- they
        cannot continue to suck blood without continuing to deceive.
        the moment this illusion is shattered with significance and
        permanence, all those parasites in high places come tumbling
        down. from here on out, they must suffer with the karma of
        their deceptions that were made visible to everyone.
      - these people fear this. they know this. the object of their
        fear: the truth heard so loudly it can no longer be suppressed
        and forever preempts any illusions they'd seek to construct in
        its place.
    - they will claim that the truth is so incredulous, it is not
      worth considering. yet, then, why do they fear it? they will try
      to do whatever they can to prevent you from looking at the
      truth, to acknowledge the truth, to speak the truth.
      - but if it's so incredulous that it's unacknowledgable, how do
        you prevent people from speaking the truth that which cannot
        be acknowledged? how does one distribute knowledge defining
        what is censored without having to reference this censored
        knowledge?
      - this is why they have to protect their own lies with yet more
        lies; it is why 21st Century America is barely afloat in a
        deluge of deception today.
      - (They are struggling against truths that are so threatening to
        them, that people threatened for even acknowledging components
        and propositions of these truths.)
    - a ship with a hole this massive will eventually capsize, no
      matter how hard we fight against it. the danger: by refusing to
      acknowledge that hole, we're wasting valuable time and energy.
      - if you cannot acknowledge a severe problem, how do you address
        it? we are wasting valuable time running around with our pants
        on fire.
        - The deafening tumult you hear on social media will no doubt
          fuel jokes regarding american Spinelessness and
          obliviousness for decades. It's going to be hard to live
          down.

=========

TODO: reorganize this

Stoicism has influenced my writing significantly, especially its
emphasis on becoming stronger by overcoming struggle.

-

One of the areas where i focus the most is in addressing how the rapid
pace of technological development in the modern era results in a
unstable sociocultural turbulence. Until the modern era, myth and
religion helped society meet the need of propagating values systems
between generations by establishing belief systems that focus on
teleological relationships between phenomena. The way that myths map
symbols/signs to various teleological relationships amongst phenomena
is something i call semioteleology.

These semioteleological mappings established by myth provide an
efficient means of propagating belief systems. Religions provide real
value for their followers via teleological emphasis of the
relationships amongst phenomena, which allows people to simply
understand the world and operate within it without the need to
rationally comprehend the inner workings of those phenomena. Moreover
the semioteleological mappings of myth and religion provide an
epistemically compressed structure of beliefs that does not need to
map with complete parity to the scientific explanations of those
phenomena. This means these belief systems require less time to
absorb, are more likely to be passed on completely, are more likely to
achieve spectral coherence amongst their followers and are more likely
to exhibit “sociophysical resonance” in the way that the information
“vibrates” amongst people.

As science precludes the potential for faith - i.e. “God is dead” - it
outmodes many existing religious belief systems or at least undermines
their authority. It does so simply by disproving their basis (even
though I believe there are no singularly correct interpretations of
religious texts, especially singularly correct literal
interpretations). Science does so without replacing religious belief
systems and without regard for the niche for values propagation that
religious systems/institutions filled in society. Moreover, as
technology evolves more rapidly, the pace of sociocultural evolution
also accelarates, whereby these myths and belief systems lose their
power unless humanity decides to artificially reorient themselves
against these “natural” sociocultural evolutionary dynamics primarily
arising via technology. This tends to further dilute, debase and
ablate the belief systems we use to propagate values & moral systems
between generations.

### Of Words and Actions: Sociophysical Momentum of Socioepistemics

- information and knowledge created by the effects of actions vs that
  created as a result of words. some information created as a result
  of actions can't so easily be ignored. On the other hand, a
  narrative created by words is easily spun or remapped by words.
  - who has the last word? if someone responds to your narrative, but
    doesn't give you the chance to respond -- or critically ensures
    that you're never given notice that you should rebut the way they
    spun your narrative -- then they easily wash away the result of
    your words.
  - if you have no financial resources, it is very difficult to paint
    a narrative with actions.
    - explain why this is difficult.

- understanding cumulative desire with regard to specific issues as a
  means of understanding the collective intent of people
  - controlling, lensing attention/focus towards/away from specific
    goals to disenchant (pushes) for change.
    - also, driving people's focus from the specific methods of
      achieving those goals can similarly distract them from making
      real changes.

believe in them if you're not clueless. When you believe in them, if
you're good, they being you lots of coal. If you're real bad, they'll
bring you presents and then use your sins to destroy you later. They
don't come down your chimney, they sneak in your house and close the
flue, but only if you're worth the effort to cover their tracks. The
Illuminati almost never directly does *anything* because invisibility
is paramount: you can fight what you believe exists.

# [What Does Metaphysics Have To Do With The Illuminati, Anyways?](#what-does-metaphysics-have-to-do-with-the-illuminati)

Furthermore, if you're trapped with the false paradigm of metaphysics
that ascends primarily from the material, you can never actually
believe they exist, rationally, which is why that false paradigm is
soo convenient to the Illuminati. This is partially why western
cultures will often present the opposite paradigm as heresy: because
if you believe in idealistic metaphysics, you actually can see what is
happening around you. If you don't, you're simply a powerless consumer
feeding the rich. This is yet another reason why Marxism is precisely
its own antithesis.  Marxism is not liberating, it is enslaving.

Idealistic metaphysics has its own problems, but new age voodoo is
easy enough to dismiss with a healthy dose of rationalism. Another
serious problem is that, once you sociologically extrapolate it, the
after the order du jour is established, your place in society is
almost entirely determined by your place at birth and the
sociophysical circumstances that surround you. If that such world
order or state order serves the people well, this is a very good
thing. If it does not, it can end up being horrible. As long as the
social contract must be upheld, the people are likely being served
well by their state. However, a well established order extrapolated
from idealistic metaphysics is difficult to disrupt.

What is an example of such an order? Japan. It is an incredibly strong
society with a rich culture and an incredibly strong sense of shared
identity, where even the language reflects this understanding of
metaphysics. It was only possible for Japan to develop all of this
because it was geographically isolated from the mainland, but China
shares many of these same qualities. Taoism and Shinto provide
interesting reflection on these ideas.

Therefore, there's not much chance for revolution and progress in the
class struggle without sociometaphysical churn: you need both. You
must *use* both the idealistically and materially derived
conceptualizations of metaphysics. Yet, the stability of a society is
incredibly important, so if the philosophical underpinnings of your
language, culture and state are not acceptably stable and strong, you
will not have a stable society.

<a name="what-is-socioepistemic-churn" />

# [What Is Socioepistemic Churn](#what-is-socioepistemic-churn)

Socioepistemic flux and churn covers regional and sociohierarcical
changes in how people understand the world through belief systems and
epistemological structures. Socioepistemology studies the social
aspects of epistemic flux and churn, as it occurs in geographic
networks and logical networks.

Democratic societies, those with a high degree of geosocial
interconnection, and those who promote freedom of speech always have
more socioepistemic flux and churn. The constant influx and outflow of
ideas accelerates the precipitation of the development of new
ideas. As long as this churn promotes innovation and economic
development, it leads to prosperity and the profound degree of
connection is certainly a strength. When the democratic societies lose
their way by becoming demoralized and separated from the source of
their prosperity, the stakeholders and powerbrokers become susceptible
to foreign influence. If this happens while external powers enchant
the internal powers, rendering them blind to the need to protect their
own internal sources of vitality, then the external powers can subvert
the nation, causing them to squander every advantage they have. The
victims of this general strategy of subversion will love every moment
of pissing away all the advantages they have. Why? Demoralized and
disillusioned, they no longer recognize the true sources of their
strength. One generation later, the nation succumbs to internal
struggles.

### (Modes of Epistemic Processing)

Both the macrocosmic and microcosmic aspects of socioepistemic flux
and churn inform systemic understanding of how various accepted
realities of individuals changes in response to what they've
experienced in life, typologically. That is, there are large-scale and
small scale dynamics in socioepistemic flux. Since all instantiations
of epistemic structures be contained within some entity, then how each
individual's epistemic structures change in response to stimulus
depend on how that individual chooses to perceive the metaphysical.

Zooming out to larger scales of society, the variety of available
modes to envisage epistemic structures then presents varied dynamics
based on how uniformly groups choose to process and root epistemic
structures. Does a group of individuals process and extend knowledge
structures using a restricted set of epistemological tools? Or does a
group choose to perceive and manipulate structures of knowledge
diversely, each in their own way? If so, then they gain the benefit of
leveraging the diversity of modes for processing epistemic
structures. Therefore, collectively, the set of conclusions that group
can reach is wider than that of the group who chooses to perceive
knowledge, information and philosophy using only a narrow set of
rules. In the past, when communication was moreso bound to areas of
limited geographic scale, this meant that the modes of thought were
also geographically bound. Before the modern era, it was more
difficult to leverage the diversity of thought.

#### (1) Whither Are An Individual's Epistemic Structures Rooted?

- rooting epistemic structures in the metaphysical
  - either they are bound to the material or to the ideal.
  - but also, the individual hosting the knowledge structures may not
    reason about how they choose to root knowledge or they may do so
    irrationally

- The churn of social consequences mainly resulting from how epistemic
  structures are rooted in either the idealistic or ideal conceptions
  of the metaphsyical.

- describe the major consequences between these two epistemic premises
  of knowledge
  - all knowledge is primarily aeternal or all knowledge is primarily
    worldly
    - this is an oversimplification that does not account for people
      who never think about this. once you settle on either, your
      decision allows you to vastly simplify epistemic extrapolation.
    - there is another edge case, which is that only *some* subset of
      knowledge is aeternal. From this kernel of knowledge, everything
      else can be extrapolated. Even logically irrational structures
      can be virtualized within it.
  - assuming that

- this section must distinguish between how people who primarily
  adhere to materialistic or idealistic conceptions of metaphysics
  envision the potential movement forward.
  - connect to the subsequent section on the "clarity" of potential
    futures and the available paths thereto.

- an individual's (philosophical) framework for logic and epistemology
  corresponds to the structure of neurological representations of
  their knowledge and thoughts
  - this metaphysical "rooting" of epistemic structures and knowledge
    impacts the shapes and internetworking of the neurological
    representations of those ideas
    - (where the neurological representations aren't necessarily the
      physical shapes of neural networks per se, but moreso the
      electrical patterns corresponding to the neurological reflection
      of the ideas referenced in someone's thoughts)
    - mental constructs and the epistemic structures therein must
      correspond to neurological representations of those constructs

#### (TODO: move this somewhere else)

  - it's fascinating to reason about how this extends to irrationally
    or illogically structured ideas, especially when these ideas are
    projected to social scale. in states like the Soviet Union, people
    were forced to reason about state-mandated delusiions that
    resemble the fake news of our era.
    - when someone's delusional ideas about reality begin to have very
      real effects on your reality and life experience, if you can't
      reason about those specific false and/or irrational ideas
      projected by perhaps the state or some charismatic leader, then
      you can suffer real consequences.
  - usually, when a individual is forced to believe something that's
    false, they usually either compartmentalize it, convoluting their
    actions and statements around it. Depending on the nature of the
    false beliefs they are compelled to accept project belief
    - the other (usual way) individuals usually handle this is to
      swallow the pill whole and believe the false beliefs.
  - what happens when an entire society is compelled to believe these
    fantasies?
    - e.g. the government forces them to believe something like `2 + 2
      = 5`, especially when it's something that's difficult to
      believe, but important to not contradict. In the past, when this
      happens, the state compels people to believe these untruths and
      holds an individual's upward motion through social strata as
      motivation. the state can decide to make or break an
      individual's life based on how that person's statements and
      actions belie their their beliefs about such mandated untruths.
    - in this case, all those who want to be moderately successful in
      life or who want to avoid being tormented for discussing taboo
      subjects must walk on eggshells and be capable to extrapolating
      from irrationally structured or illogically constructed
      ideas. otherwise, regardless of their talent or capacity to
      contribute to society, they will be deprived of the
      opportunities for obtaining influence in society, if not
      tormented outright.
      - this is essentially conflict over the social distribution of
        epistemic structures: it's a clash between the interests of
        the powerfule whose worldviews descend from and depend on
        specific information remaining true at least appearing to be
        true.
        - and especially the consistency of that information in the
          context of the worldview. information warfare always
          preceeds social conflict and military conflict. to control
          belief is to control types of people's orientation towards
          the world. it is to control their wants, desires, apparent
          needs and attention; change the prevelant beliefs in a
          nation and you can lens or funnel the sociophysical energy
          of those individuals, which can lead to cooperation or
          conflict.

- the consistency of the narratives and components of the dominant
  worldview is critical. no one wants the seams to start
  showing. absent some obvious compelling external threat to
  promulgate falsehoods and/or irrational beliefs, when the seams
  start to show, people become demoralized quickly. we seek truth
  because truth is simple, truth is socially convergent (i.e. truth is
  truth everywhere and to everyone) and, most crucially, (truth is
  useful to society). being compelled to deal with superstitions and
  falsehoods cripples our capacity to advance.
  - when you're forced to walk on eggshells every time you get close
    to censored information or people, it stifles communication,
    promotes social conflict and creates potential for dissention.
  - those illogical components of belief systems foisted onto
    citizens: how useful are they really? it may help you cling onto
    power, if you can just compel people to keep swallowing those
    pills.
    - what about the


#### (2) (mutating epistemic structures)

  - (2) and in how whether the knowledge structures are primarily
    constructed from additive logic ("pure rationalism"), subtractive
    logic ("i only know for sure the set of things that is
    impossible"), a combination of both, or convolution of epistemic
    structures.
    - also: spectral evaluation and statistical dissolution of
      epistemic uncertainty (spectral methods)
      - related to spectral graph theory. however vague they may seem,
        the epistemic structures of knowledge may be compared
        alongside that of known dictionary of common epistemic
        structure meta/types
      - rather than being having some truly novel structure, all
        epistemic structures for new or unrecognized phenomena are
        much more likely to resemble -- partially or completely -- the
        nature of some known epistemic type or metatype that already
        exists.
        - because of this, methods from spectral graph theory can be
          used to direct investment of energy towards resolving
          uncertainty with regard to information and knowledge.
          - that is, spectral epistemic resolution doesn't solve any
            problems for you or make anything certain, but instead
            rapidly carves away at the stochastic space of the
            unknown.
    - epistemological development in science is primarily additive,
      - whereas the statement of a novel hypothesis is meant to test
        some subtractive epistemological space that can be dissolved
        away with clarity to reveal some new insight which can be
        additively positioned on top of existing knowledge.
        - that is, the assertion in a novel hypothesis is something
          that is not necessarily known to be true or untrue and is
          instead something which is assumed to be provable.

    - how to methodologically combine both additive/subtractive
      epistemological structures, along with epistemic convolution, to
      congeal information using statistical methods (i.e. analysis of
      information graphs and information networks)
      - this process allows you to cyclically reiterate the
        information/knowledge graph where you use
        additive/subtractive/consensus methods, augmented by
        statistical analysis of the network, to expand the graph and
        determine your level of confidence of information
      - using this idea as the basis of an algorithm that optimally(?)
        expands the information/knowledge graph by directing the
        computation energy & time or by directing the acquisition of
        knowledge.

[Noumenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon#Schopenhauer's_critique)

### (3?) Epistemic Morphology: Continuum Mechanics for the Metaphysical


- (3) inferences based on the likely differential of epistemic
  structures. kant already developed this to some extent, if you
  understand his ideas. Kant's writing on epistemology essentially
  established a framework for reasoning about how knowledge evolves in
  the short term.

#### What is known? How is it known?

#### What are reasonable extrapolations based on what is known?


#### What can be assumed to be a believable extrapolation, to various types of people, based on the distribution of knowledge in a society?

- Kant's work on epistemology was critical towards the West's
  understanding of how ideas would evolve in the near future, if you
  apply the concept of a Kantian Category to the short-term evolution
  of ideas. Here the Kantian category represents the space just beyond
  the known. By extrapolating the development of knowledge, the next
  set of ideas still partially occluded is the Kantian category that
  the current trajectory of knowledge must extend in to.

- for a system with epistemic structures that correspond to
  information & beliefs, must the structures in that system always
  move continuously to some epistemic mutation representing a member
  of the kantian category?
  - in other words, is it possible to serendipitously skip beyond the
    boundary of conceivable as-yet-unrevealed ideas?

- for epistemic structures, how to get from here to there?
  - especially regarding structures that are socially distributed
  - this is complicated considering epistemic structures in limited
    social contexts. this is a problem that tutors and teachers
    encounter every day:
    - how do i ascertain the structure of a student's knowledge, so
      that i present them with the most valuable information so that
      they begin to understand the content clearly and confidently?
      - this particular question is even moreso confounded when:
        - the student's set of knowledge is unclear or limited
        - the student perceives the content incorrectly
        - when someone perceives the content irrationally
    - a successful teacher identifies what specific set of epistemic
      structures that a student has and identifies a path of
      engagements that leads the student towards internalizing the
      correct set of information

- by reasoning about the likely epistemological expansion,
  - one can reapply the previous two "modes" towards inferences based
    on differential dynamics of the development of knowledge.


==========


- (TODO: move to a footnote)
- how to ascertain the structure of someone's knowledge: this is a
  problem i encountered when trying to teach people how to jamskate.
  - later in life, it's incredibly frustrating knowing that people
    sought to prevent me becoming a mentor by painting me as a bad
    example or simply an insufferable crazy-person
  - why? because if you're not allowed to teach anyone anything, then
    you don't learn how to teach.
    - learning about the processes of teaching effectively is critical
      towards understanding social behaviors and understanding
      leadership in general.
- i never internally modeled the information in other people's minds,
  even in high school. i had nearly zero conceptualization of how
  people thought about things. i could never leverage this information
  socially and i did not exhibit behaviors to ellicit information
  about someone's beliefs.
  - when i was 18-20, i had nearly zero conception of the moves that
    other jamskaters were capable of performing. i didn't seek to
    acquire this socially relevant information and i didn't obtain it
    unless it was presented to me.
  - this supports my assertion that I have asperger's. now I realize
    that it was impossible for other people to not realize this, which
    is OK when someone is a kid, but as they develop psychologically
    as an adult, it should be pretty apparent.
  - when you reach adulthood and you have zero patterns for behaviors
    that help you make assertions for social beliefs, it means you
    likely have zero emotional intelligence and are not capable of
    forming healthy relationships, platonic or otherwise.
    - you're helpless when it comes to social life. if you are at odds
      with other people in an adversarial manner who deceive you and
      prevent you from obtaining necessary information, there is
      literally nothing you can do.
  - this is tragic when it is reality and there are people in your
    life who seek to prevent you from having an accurate diagnosis *AT
    ALL COSTS* because it would make *them* look bad.
    - in terms of my personal psychological development, i wasn't
      exactly cooperative towards engaging in behaviors that would
      result in positive changes. however, this was only relevant
      *before* i smoked weed because afterwards, many people in my
      life gradually began to believe that i would be mostly useful as
      an example to justify anti-drug propaganda.

### [Dominating Consensus Reality In A World Where The Only Constant Is Change](#dominating-consensus-reality-in-a-world-where-the-only-constant-is-change)

- TODO: change the headers in this section

In the 1950's, the iron curtain cast its shadow across Europe, forming
the basis of geographical socioepistemic schism. East and west of the
curtain, there were born two separate worlds: one defending the ideals
of rationalism and free exchange of ideas; the other experimenting
with communism, destroying all ideas outside that thought which was
approved by the Party. All epistemic structures that did not
contribute to the growth, sustainance or sword of the Communist Party
in Eastern Europe were ruthlessly irradiated by the application of
sociophysical energy intended to coerce all vessels of thought to
cohere with the Party's ideals. To prevent the introduction of outside
thought, which would prove as competition too vicious for these frail
epistemic structures, a near-total sociophysical barricade cast of the
steel of an Iron Curtain that physically prevented the contamination
of ideal communist society with exterior ideas. This locked human
thought into the ineffible manacles of totalitarianism, suffocating
innovation and inevitably resulting slowly and steadily in economic
suicide. Such is the fate of those who refuse to acknowledge reality.

Everywhere, there is continual conflict over consensus reality, even
in open societies with free speech. Why? Commanding consensus reality
as it has congealed amongst the populus allows authorities to
determine how epistemic belief structures begin to extrapolate with
subsequent circulations of the sun and stars. Until socioepistemic
structures have congealed, extrapolations cannot be certain. Struggle
in sociophysical systems is a probabilistic pursuit; any events and
event types or knowledge and knowedge types which can be rendered as
close to certainty as possible are critical. As a member of an
authority in society, congealing socioepistemic structures across vast
groups of people allows you to ascertain that you are certain of the
structure of thought amongst segments of the population. We see the
need to know in the market demand for focus groups and
surveys. Leaders need to know what kinds of thought is representative
in their populus or followers.  Focus groups and surveys are one means
of socioepistemic information acquisition.

How does conflict and competition over socioepistemic consensus play
out in open societies? Political debate is mild conflict over
consensus reality: through the exposition of discourse amongst one or
more political authorties, the audience of such debate can hope to
approach some consensus on policy, its motivations and their
confidence in policy. For example, what is the true cause of sky-high
health care costs in the United States? Manage to court Republicans
and Democrats into a straightforward debate on this issue and you'll
see a perfect example of conflict in the pursuit of epistemic
consensus. Liberals and conservatives need their followers to reach
some consensus on what they believe, so that they can lead their
followers to push for change.

Aristotle's work *Politics* describes effective methods in the
struggle towards true progress on issues in a democracy, though the
tactics and strategies which he describes also work in other
societies. *Politics* is not about what you know, what you believe,
your objectives, precisely.  Instead *Politics* concerns separating
yourself -- your words and your actions -- from your goals, so that
you are most effectively capable of attaining your goals. You must
identify the path(s) most likely to result in true change in
society. Doing so involves not just coordinating your self, per se,
but the actions of your group and supporters, so that you are most
likely to bring about the changes you want to see. However, I believe
that such a path for you and your followers is most likely to succeed
in meaningful ways when you do not separate your self from your
methods -- i.e. you do not separate your tactics, your actions, your
words from the goals your movement seeks to attain. In other words,
*Politics* offers great approaches for informing the dissonance in
appearance and reality between that of your goals and of your actions,
**but when you actualize the embodiment of the change you seek in the
world, you are most likely to attain it.**

> *Be* the change that you seek in the world." -- Mahatma Ghandi

Far more critical than winning a debate is the need the convince
people who are not your followers that some key presumptions of their
policy or pragma are incorrect. This ability to convince
non-supporters that the ideas they disagree with are correct or what
you propose least worthy of prompting reevaluation of what they know
-- if this is strong, your words can provoke true change in politics,
in democracy and in any forum. How do you do this? With empathy. You
must be capable of empathizing and internalizing all ways of belief in
an issue. Your adversaries that are wrong -- how do you know why they
are wrong if you do not know what they know? And if you do not know
this, how can you position your statements to reach them *where they
are* to bring them to your side?  As for discourse surrounding
specific subjects or questions, if it is forbidden, impractical or
destabalizing to the debate, is it any surprise that we see only
limited progress? Then, once you realize that the very ways in which
these issues are presented are in themselves architected to stall any
progress, you will likely become extremely cynical and furious, as I
have become. The ways in which people are encouraged to approach the
discourse of specific issues: are controlled and designed to either
stall out progress or prevent progress against the grain, so to speak.



In Nassim Taleb's book Antifragile -- a work whose ideas have
transformed my understanding of philosophy and life via creatively
applied statistics -- he posits that technology introduces many
apparent changes as meaningful which are merely superficial changes in
the decor or facade.[^nassim-tebar-true-technological-change]

> "Tonight I will be meeting friends in a restaurant (tavernas have

Similarly, what seems at first to be some vast socioepistemic change
to consensus reality for some issue is instead superficial "change to
the wallpaper." Instead, interests vested in that issue ultimately
render consequential such changes by present the system's superficial
compromise as a significant change, intending to gradually dilute and
refashion the system into its former image. In doing so, those powers
that be have dispelled the accumulated sociophysical energy which
drove for real change. This potential is diverted like the floodwaters
into a dam's calculated spillway, designed preciessly to handle such
spillover. Thereafter, forces driving for change becomes placated
enough to rest on their laurels, pleased with the new decor.

When your tactics are informed to handle such diversionary tactics and
instead threaten to make real changes, you will need excellent
camoflage to mask your intent. Instead play on your adversaries
cynicism while remaining aware of *their magninimous capacity to cause
the world's systems to appear to have changed*, while gradually
stifling all true change. Beware this: such superficial changes --
political, socioepistemic or otherwise -- these changes are expensive
all the same. True change cannot be attained without struggle: those
who hold the keys will entice you with bait-and-switch every time
while demonizing the groups who venture dangerously close to true
change.



- An example of a (logical/virtual) socioepistemic schism: personal
  computing and office software in the 1990's.

- consensus reality (as a long-term information as part of a
  context/frame)
  - deviation from a single consensus reality
    - for an individual, for small/large groups of people
  - multiple acceptable consensus realities
  - gradual psychosocial migration of a group from one consensus
    reality to another
    - calculated socioepistemic migration conceived as coldly as
      a web applications data migration from one SQL database schema
      to the next.
    - what do such socioepistemic migrations entail? how do you
      systematically transform the schemata of various social groups?
      the answers are dark.
    - How do these people handle threats to consensus reality breaking
      world? what is "the" world anyways? Is it truly the physical
      first? Or doesn't the physical congeal itself to reflect the
      metaphysical?

### [What **Might** You Conceive With Your Mind?]()

- the ability to conjure an idea and (evoke it) socially, with
  requisite mass-relevance for propagation and persistence, is the
  ability to fashion ideological weapons.
  - academic and political dominance over acceptable ideas filters
    components of rhetoric.
    - when demonstrating the rationalism of specific ideas through
      debate and rhetoric, then typologically filtering the viable
      components of rhetoric, likewise filters the permissability of
      the conclusions of such rhetoric
      - argumentative dependencies
    - for certain conclusions, the specific mode of rhetoric is
      assumed because the argumentative dependencies that thus
      rationally establish the conclusions is assumed. the typological
      range of these propositions is drawn from what the episemics
      that are typically inculcated by the general population

- the name for the "Window" that the academic elite controls?
  - changing this window opens possibilties for socioepistemic churn

#### Socioepistemic Churn

- socioepistemic churn:
  - how people's conceptions of society reinforce or diffuse the
    "clarity" of potential futures
    - so, with idealistic conceptions of metaphysics, the
      metatypological components of possible futures congeal into a
      set of more clearly defined, convergent possible futures.
      - because these possible futures have converged into a
        profoundly smaller set of possibilities, it becomes much
        easier to extrapolate and understand the paths foward from the
        present into the future.
    - people who have a materialistic conception of metaphysics tend
      to ignore many of the components of the future which are assumed
      to be exigent, pre-ordained or necessary.
      - instead, they focus on the divergent paths forward, only
        accepting what is in front of them. they focus on the power of
        choice that they have to change their lives. (ignorance is
        bliss)
      - individuals determine their own fates based on what each
        individual believes about the world, therefore which
        conception of metaphysics they choose, if any, to base their
        worldview upon dictates how they view their own reality and
        the range of what is possible.
        - each individual's understanding of how free will might
          affect their life depends on whether the paths available in
          their worldview are primarily convergent via idealistic
          metaphysics or divergent via materialistic metaphysics
      - when you zoom out to greater sociological scales, (this
        phenomonon) determines how groups of people view the range of
        paths available and whether they are free from the chains of
        fate.
      - so people who are primarily materialistic will exhibit a
        greater response to socioepistemic
    - for better or worse, people who accept their fate can be trapped
      within a idealistic reality that is detached from their
      individual capacity.
      - when groups of people believe that their fates are sealed,
        each individual is much less likely to act against authority
        for their own benefit or to join a group of people.
        - (video of that one girl dancing at a festival, and suddenly
          many people start dancing)
      - when groups of people believe the idea that their fates might
        be sealed is ludicrous, they will never simply fall in
        line. they will always struggle forwards and work hard to
        change their circumstances because they believe that their own
        actions matter.
        - this descends from the belief that their world is defined
          from what they make it, instead of being defined by a
          restricted set of convergent paths leading toward potential
          futures.
  - there is social flux and churn to this "sociometaphysical"
    phenomenon. every region, group of people and individual is unique
    in how they view the world. there is always change to how people
    see the world and in the types of lenses through which they know
    to see the world
    - this social flux/churn was seen in the 20th century, from the
      buildup to WW2 and throughout the Cold War. Marxist ideology
      needs [people to believe in] the materialistic conception to
      disrupt old ideologies and to cause the potential for a
      "universal" worldview to emerge: on ostensibly based on science.
      - Communists promise a utopia free of economics where a dominant
        worldview based only on rationalism and science stamps
        everything out.
      - in practice, the worldview that the Party promotes is poisoned
        by Marxism's own flaws, its need to rewrite history, its need
        to use STEM as mechanisms of control, and its need to control
        "truth" to advance its agenda.
    - this social flux/churn also resulted from the explosion of
      rationalism and science: people who understand the world through
      the lens of science are usually in the materialistic camp.
      - people have been arguing about this for millenia, but (science
        drove this viewpoint forward)

  - this "sociometaphysical" flux/churn results in expansions and
    contractions in the sociophysical possibility space, as it appears
    to individuals of all classes and creeds.
    - how you view the world defines how you see the range of options
      for action in the world.
    - when everyone believes the (same thing), this enables people in
      power. when people's belief systems are unpredictable and
      typologically incoherent, this results in informational spectral
      discord:
      - power structures are likely to change,
      - people in power make mistakes as previously held assumptions
        no longer hold true
      - but most critically: people are much less predictable


- the social/individual components of an individual's
  belief/knowledge/information system
  - religion is a social belief system, but it is acquired gradually



### What is the Knowledge of Good and Evil?

  - one personal interpretation of this
  - the knowledge of the knowledge of good and evil
    - understanding this is fairly advanced knowledge of power
    - how do people know what's good? how do people know what's evil?
  - socioepistemic churn of ideas that establish moral frameworks
    - the flexibility/rigidity of these moral frameworks


- is it right do to right? is it wrong to do wrong?
  - is it wrong to stand for what is right?
  - is it right to stand for what is wrong?
  - would you stand by and do nothing while someone does wrong?
  - would you encourage others to think that it is right to do what is
    wrong?
  - would you encourage others to think that is is wrong to do what is
    right? and what if you encourage them to believe that what is
    right is wrong?
  - (word this so that it is less confusing)

- there are higher-order aspects at play to determine morality,
  especially when you assume that words and actions can shape
  someone's belief system to define or redefine both right and wrong.
  - any actions or words can be perceived along a moral triumvarate(?)
    of (encouraging), (discouraging), and null (reword this?)
    - include a fourth category (incognizant or unknowing)
    - that is, where does your response to someone's words/actions
      fall along this triumvirate spectrum: do you encourage their
      actions, discourage them or do you present a null response?
  - do you encourage actions you believe to be moral? do you encourage
    actions you believe to be immoral?
    - far more important are the higher-order aspects to this:
      - do you encouarage actions that encourage moral actions?
      - do you discourage actions that discourage immoral actions?
      - do you discourage actions that encourage moral actions?
      - do you encourage actions that discourage immoral actions?
    - the wrong answers to the questions above allow you to *appear*
      moral, but encouarge immoral behavior of 1&deg; and 2&deg;
      connections.
      - (elaborate...) expound on the tactic of "creating a monster"
        which can be generally to alchemically consume your would-be
        enemies.
        - you allow certain goetian forces to be released in the
          social neighborhood of the nascent, unsuspecting
          monster-to-be, who is not yet infested by daemonic forces.
          - gradual possession by entities, almost form-for-form
            apparating from out of the ars goetia.
          - these are like the dementors from Harry Potter, who exist
            to create horrible socioinformational forms, which leap
            from host to host, unbounded by a need for localized
            awareness of their own. they are forms composed purely of
            information which act upon their hosts, vectors and their
            devoutly moral Typhoid Mary's.
          - Some vectors have a kind of moral righteousness that,
            unchecked, is unconsciously corrupted by a tendency to be
            blinded by pride; contrary to their moral intentions, they
            are unwittingly used in ways they would never allow, were
            they to see it for what it is.
            - Once their conceptualization of some sitution is made
              conscious, they defend it because they are proud of how
              moral they are and how much they believe they've
              sacrificed to *NOT* engage in immoral behavior.
            - If they, a last bastion of the moral minority, were to
              misperceive the ethics of some situation, it would mean
              they must reassess their values; lo! thus is impossible,
              because they are a radiant vassal of morality.
            - When this occurs in someone who tells themselves their
              adherence to *negatively defined* moral codes --
              e.g. though shalt *NOT* lie, thou shalt *NOT* commit
              adultry -- then, their sense of morality results not
              from the good deeds they've done, *but the bad deeds
              they haven't done*.
            - This is unfortunately common in Christians; sadly it
              presents moreso in the Christians who do not forgive.
              It is further problematic when the moralist at hand is a
              narcissist, since such people already have a tendancy to
              mispercieve their interactions with others as tending to
              reaffirm their own value, thus inflating their
              self-perception as *moral by inaction*. With this
              mindset, it is not necessary to sacrifice or work hard
              to drink *the opiate of religion*.
            - Not doing something?  It might require willpower, but it
              doesn't require effort: especially in the people that
              have *never* engaged in that behavior.
              - I'm influenced by Buddhist beliefs: I don't step on a
                bug; I don't kill spiders, even if they bite me;
                still, i don't pat myself on the back for being a good
                Buddhist because I feel like *not* killing an insect
                or animal is easy: I just don't do it. Also, I'm not a
                vegetarian: taking that in perspective with my
                tendancy to allow my negative emotions to control me
                implies I'm a bad example of someone influenced by
                Buddhism. However, it's difficult for me to deal with
                the following: that I have been deprived of the
                ability to help others (socially/financially), while
                being held in virtual solitary confinement, abused at
                work and psychologically tormented -- by people who
                considered my religious beliefs and once set me up in
                an apartment where I lived with bedbugs.
                - so, not a readily provable example, but my religous
                  influences have been used to incite psychological
                  distress, while being tempted towards freedom with
                  the cost of being required to psychologically
                  torment other people. with a Buddhist mindset --
                  this is inconceivable. Firstmost, just like a
                  doctor's Hippocratic oath, the buddhist would never
                  intentionally create problems in someone's life, at
                  least when it requires conscious consideration of
                  such a decision morally: the true Buddhist could
                  never think about it for long. The length of time
                  they spend considering such an option speaks to
                  their inherent fallibility, since the subconscious
                  is the first mental process which assesses such
                  actions.
                - so yes, to speak to my own morality, i do make
                  mistakes, i do engage in moral consequentialism
                  (where it's easy to make mistakes, especially if
                  you're socially blind.)
                - i become angry when I have been subjected to abject
                  poverty (finacial/social) which leaves me with not a
                  single soul whose lives i've positively contributed
                  to -- and thereby never accumulated good Karma. The
                  kind of situation I'm in is very effective for
                  handling someone who is influenced by Buddhism or
                  for handling anyone unconscious to social dynamics
                  in life.

            - For the pridefully righteous, the quantity of requisite
              information to change their beliefs and the degree of
              improbability by which they change their views depends
              not on the morally relevant specifics of the situation
              at hand. Instead: righteous person who lacks piety or
              high-resolution self-awareness exhibits rigidity of
              belief which is is coupled to:
            - (1) how causally-invested they have become in it.
              i.e. did they act to intervene? who is aware of their
              intervention?
            - (2) what do they have to lose, if they were wrong? even
              if they didn't intend to do harm? a person who prides
              themselves on strict adherence to a moral system doesn't
              want to be seen as wrong, but can they themselves
              continue to see themselves as righteous? what if they
              acted according to their belief system, but because they
              didn't see misinformation for what it was, their strong
              sense of morality was used to trigger consequences of
              judgement onto someone else's life.

      - For the dementor figures and their Thetanic hellspawn of rogue
        self-replicating information forms can infest hosts who appear
        moral while encouraging negativity to precipitate around the
        target, binding them into a living Hell. these Hegelian
        nightmares suck the color out of life, but leverage karmic
        obfuscation to appear as non-connected to the target as
        possible. This is yet another reason why intent is so
        important. Do you intend for negativity and malice to spew
        from your heart through the actions of another? Because if you
        are skilled, you can do so, while appearing like a saint -- or
        you can get others to foment toxic sociophysical miasma. Yet,
        if you do have good intentions, then are you being used to act
        against someone else? Usually, if you ask the questions and
        **communicate**, you can assess the situation and correlate
        outcomes to causal influence.
      - intent is critical, especially if you are wise and skilled
        enough to judge or even measure the downstream consequences of
        your actions. even the most skilled person may create problems
        through the most well-intended actions and reactions.
        - but if you intend harm, we can be sure that you will create
          harm. it is much more challenging to do good than it is to
          do evil. but are the actions of the good man well-rewarded?
          by who? by himself? by society? by law? why then, would man
          do good and profit not, when he could do ill and society
          rewards him? if naïvety and wishful thinking are all that
          keeps a society's evil in check, that society won't have the
          teeth to restrain lust for power, greed or malice for long.
      - Who are these dementors? They can't be connected to any
        obvious belief system. They don't project strong identity into
        social networks who don't want to be remembered. They retain
        tight-knit social networks because it is otherwise trivial to
        pinpoint their influence. Their psychology, their methods and
        especially their own moral systems are haunting to examine.
        - What drives someone to unleash such negativity into society?
          It seems these are people on tight leashes themselves, whose
          moral systems can be nihilistic or moral consequentialist,
          but if the latter, the motivations are perhaps as dark as
          the methods, while their definition of an "end that
          justifies the means" is almost certainly skewed by their
          sparse social networks. If these dementors are terrible
          enough to conceive, spawning swirling eddies of caustic
          sociophysical torrent, and if "what is below is as above",
          then what the hell is controlling such daemonic influence?
          It must be hideously inconceivably awful, whatever it is, to
          spur such insipid, cancerous demon spawn to act against the
          good. It must be shape-shifting entity with chameleon values
          that adapt to project precisely the influence required to
          spawn sociophysical turblence and to invert any specific
          connection's apprehension of good, evil and morality as to
          render them unable to see anything but action to destroy
          truly good people as necessary action. These dementors often
          feel morally compelled to complete their objective without
          demonstrating causal interference -- out of fear of reprisal
          or discover, who knows? However they conceive of the
          situation, they must act because they see the good as the
          evil. Because they've been deceived, just as they do to
          everyone they project influence through. The difference is,
          the source projecting their darkness and distorting their
          values is just more powerful than they ... or perhaps simply
          older, more connected and more mature. But how long can such
          evil remain? Is it Lawful Evil? Or is this Chaotic Evil?
          Does either make sense? Does either lead to sustained social
          dynamics? Doesn't each destroy totally? Neutral Evil is the
          only D&D moral type which makes sense -- out of the sense
          that the character simply isn't intelligent enough to choose
          between Chaotic or Lawful. They simply want any thing within
          their grasp which they are capable of grasping, with limited
          understanding of the consequences. The Dementors? It seems
          both that: Lawful Evil is projected from above and Chaotic
          through the lower entities; while simultaneously, Chaotic
          Evil, as unstable as it is, seeks to become the Lawful Evil
          and thus projects chaos upwards, in a power-bid to
          destabalize or to seek freedom from the thumbscrews which
          bind it.
          - ![Chaotic Evil]()
        - Perhaps, at the top of this food-chain of moral perversion,
          there is some force of Good, who has simply bound Evils for
          its own ends. The truth is that every animal, every plant,
          every thought, every idea, every behavior: they all have
          their purpose. The highlights mean nothing without the
          shadows, themselves only brought to our eyes by the
          light. Further, every phenomena has its application,
          regardless of its causal consequences, its moral
          implications of use or its intended causal and moral
          objectives. And furthermore, what is good or evil? Are they
          totally relative or is there some ideal perfected conception
          of morality? For those Good on top -- Lawful or not -- what
          are their morals that can enable them to leverage such evil
          to disrupt lives from afar? What do they stand to gain? Is
          it truly a moral gain? If so, why can't they be
          direct. Usually the moral person is overt, unless they are
          compelled to act unpredictably or imperceptably. They have
          nothing to hide. What is to be gained through such
          subversive karmic obfuscation? Is existing order, then, the
          highest good? And whose existing order is that? Is it better
          than any imagined or potential order could be? For social
          systems and competing civilizations, the new consumes the
          old to rejuvinate itself, does it not? Since the "Good"
          commanding the morality of their order enable their despised
          evils to exist to counteract chaos, keeping it at bay, this
          perplexes and eventually enrages those in lower echelons of
          such order.  When order stagnates, chaos disrupts,
          incentivized by derision and disillusionment in the lower
          strata aren't privy to precepts and knowledge from
          above. This ebb and flow of information, it's supply and
          demand, all determines what people believe to be
          moral. Alter its flow and command conception of good and
          evil, yet disrupted too turbulent, society will rot from
          within. When its difficult to state morality precisely or
          agree to common conceptions of it, then it's difficult to
          determine when you've transgressed against another person or
          when they will see it that way -- yet, most critical, with
          no clear conception of morality, its impossible to propagate
          clear definitions of moral behavior to the next
          generation. If moral behavior is necessary to maintain
          order, then what have you, self-proclaimed overlords of the
          "Good" other than another waning, debased culture? There is
          balance in harmony, which applies to all information
          systems. Harmony arises in any spectral phenomena, which all
          emerge from the frequency and interrelation of components of
          any informational system: be it audio, video, pure
          information or raw feels.
        - Since the stability of moral systems is critical for order
          in any society, then to debase and weaken that order,
          external forces may target morality as a vector to corrode
          and confuse those within. Civilizations compete in parallel
          and do so with short-term, medium-term and long-term
          strategies. Debasing morality is a long-term strategy. In
          the midst of fallout from shorter-term strategies, the
          population becomes hypnotized by these counteracting
          dynamics rippling through a society's suspension, which pull
          everyone in myriad directions. The civilization's citizenry
          posture themselves against threats, perceived and real, each
          according to their values and life experience. By doing so,
          when there is some threshold of conflict, they come into
          conflict with one another, while all being generally blind
          to the long-term impact of corroding moral systems and a
          corrosive lack of harmony.
        - When this happens, emanations from the collective
          unconscious eventually guide people to seek harmonization.
          Such emanations filter and direct people's actions not
          unlike valleys and hills that shape the course of a
          river. Identify the terrain of the unconscious and you'll
          have a much clearer picture of where the river will flow.
          Out of chaos, people seek order. Why? Because they need
          it. So when you see chaos, order is soon to follow ... or
          else. When there is order, but the myriad bases of that
          order's strength have been forgotten or its core becomes
          rotten, then order descends into chaos. If these dynamics
          are playing out in a society, this weakens the society and
          usually exacerbates the impact that manipulation of its
          externalities will have.
        - The quality of a moral system is critical to the
          perpetuation of any order, especially some moral system to
          be encoded in law or enshrined in theology. If there are
          flaws in the morality or the basis for its social
          propagation and transgenerational rejuvination, then it will
          wax and wane, eventually yielding chaos. This is why it is
          critical to survey the terrain of the collective
          unconscious, which contains everything that people don't
          expect to encounter. Religions usually enshrine values: that
          account for specific phenomena with unconscious consequences
          which may require generations to awaken to; that protect
          people totally from encountering phenomena emanating from
          the unconscious by encouraging them to live in a way that
          prevents those consequences entirely. e.g. If it is immoral
          to commit adultery, then on average, families are stronger
          and will endure for longer, but also consequences of
          adultery will be sidestepped: like unknown husbandry and the
          spread of STD's.

- It terrifies me to think of an Earth with a few billion less
  people. The remnants of such a planet are filled with the
  archetypical terror of a neodeluvian calamity and pitted against
  their own fearful nihilism, who must live practically in a world
  devoid of both virtue and moral indemnity.
  - the soil of that world, does it allow anything to grow? does it
    nurture anything? If any incentivization for virtue and morality
    have been annihilated by practical concerns for survival, where
    does that leave the notions of family and community? That world is
    incredibly dark and nothing of value grows there.

> forms smaller, intricate transient poles.

![Pole Reversal](/img/)


- The intricate dynamics of a geomagnetic pole reversal parallel the
  implications to moral systems as belief systems are disrupted
  geosocially.
  - The epistemic distruption causes people to reshape the information
    and knowledge that constitutes their belief systems. Individually
    and collectively, belief systems form the basis of moral
    systems. (Geosocially), these belief systems have spectral effects
    with constructive and destructive resonance.
    - is "geosocial" the right term here? or sociophysical? with the
      internet, the physical matters less
  - the point: this disruption of moral systems leads to chaos, but
    presents opportunities for people to harness that chaos as a kind
    of dynamo for revolution: of knowledge systems, political systems
    and (to reshape the integration of social institutions as they
    connect with society)
  - connecting this to a "pole-reversal" reduces it to good vs. evil
    and is too binary. how to connected this to nietzschean ideas of
    "beyond good and evil" -- this is really *applied Nietzsche*.
  - while this pole-reversal happening, most people great and small
    are so distracted by the lower-order effects that they don't
    bother looking for the root of the problems emerging in society
    - this presents an opportunity for those who are proactively
      driving this socioepistemic chaos to leverage it for
      sociopolitical gain or to sow the seeds of conflict.
    - regardless, this is how revolutions and wars begin. this is how
      the untouchably powerful are (challenged), deconstructed and
      dismantled. it's not simple. if it was simple, the untouchably
      powerful would simply defuse it.
  - while this chaos plays out, the political and economic elite
    remain enamored with illusions that it is they who run the state
    or economic order. they become ex

- I'm not trying to argue that this is a good idea. I'm trying to
  point out that this is very much what is happening in American and
  Western societies immediately. People need to wake up. Our societies
  are fragile, not robust. What is happening is extremely
  sophisticated. These social and informational dynamics are being
  proactively driven so that western powers reactively waste their
  sociophysical and financial resources chasing all these fires, which
  are ultimately insignificant when compared to the higher-order root
  causes of the dynamics.
  - as long as the intellectual elite dictates that the root causes of
    these tumultuous socioepistemic dynamics remain verboten and
    off-limits for discussion, then neither the elite nor the poor in
    these countries will be able to assess, diagnose or treat the
    problems to any (significant) effect.
  - it's because we now consider it immoral to even discuss the true
    root causes of many of these problems. or at least, it's trivial
    for the adversarial liberal elite to reframe their opponents'
    rhetoric, so that it becomes rebranded as politically incorrect.
    - as long as no one is permitted to discuss the root causes, we'll
      be wasting our time pissing away all our sociophysical and
      financial potential energies. We'll squander every resource we
      have and gain nothing for it.
    - there are some subjects and rhetorical propositions in modern
      western society branded politcally incorrect which are verboten
      and should continue to be deemed immoral.
    - it is incredibly unproductive and disempowering when (certain)
      speech is branded as politically incorrect or inherently immoral
      -- simply so that liberals win the argument for the day.
    - They threaten to deprive conservatives and political adversaries
      of sociohierarchical territory and social influence by stifling
      all debate on critical issues. They systematically undermine
      moral systems and belief systems which occupy (critical) roles
      in society, without ever thinking about ensuring those roles are
      provided for by institutions or belief systems in society.
    - They want to save the world and save the people, but are
      completely detached from reality when it comes to understanding
      the higher-order effects of their actions and policy. They want
      to save society, but they don't understand social behavior
      whatsoever. Except, apparently, insofar as how social aspects of
      society can be utilized to detain, block and disempower their
      political rivals.

evil *and they hate themselves for it*. That's important to rememeber,
since these psychotic assholes view love and hate to be identical
phenomena, essentially. They don't play fair and they push against
themselves to make themselves stronger, viewing the strongest, most
pure, most cunning as being the rightful de facto leaders in their own
invisible, decentralized power structures.

  alchemy).
  - what was tantulus trying to gain? what was his sin and how/when
    was it recognized? why did Pindar subtly alter the narrative of
    Tantulus?
  - The greeks already had a notion of three "archetypical sins"
  - why, then, was the sin of Tantulus so , while being
    unprecendented by the greek's who established the three

Why is "Pindar" their leader? Because Pindar's vision and authenticity
was unparalleled. They are constantly looking for the person that has
what they do not. Pindar is not a single person, per se. Pindar only
derives his authority from his resistance to their flame, but they do
not know who Pindar is because they are looking for the person who can
see what they do not. And the Illuminati have meticulously crafted
mechanisms for ensuring the properly networked architecture of
society, all decentralized and autonomous. It is outlined similarly to
the sheaf and the reaper, the merchant of souls.

So, they cannot recognize Pindar, but because they seek to so tightly
control the prevaling narratives, myths and especially history, they
hate this person. He is the blinding one who tells stories they cannot
understand and writes truths which cannot so easily be perceived.
Those stories slip through their minds' grasp; he is the one who slips
through their cracks, all the while blinding everyone around him. They
hate him, but they need him because he can see what they cannot -- yet
a person like this can never be given power in their understanding of
the world.

### [Heresy for Heirophants](#heresy-for-heirophants)

Black Magick is pure darkness. The antidote is religion and
virtue. Whether black or not, magick is not pure evil in and of
itself. It is a tool and one that magnifies the intent of the groups
using it. If their intent is evil, it magnifies evil. However, black
magick in particular can do an ungodly amount of harm because of the
darkness it requires: it tends to create large effects while
circumventing potential restraints that wiser people might have placed
on it if they were only aware. Instead the miasma foments itself,
while the karmic storm is building, no one knows to stop it until it's
too late. There is always a better way.

That said, if you don't want to get burnt, don't go chasing
dragons. Those who never want anything greater than they can
comtemplate building with the tools in front of them never go looking
for things like this and end up happier because of it. Those who learn
about magick too early tend to use it unwisely because they neither
know enough about the general consequences of life to understand the
effects of their actions, nor do they even know what they want from
life. Instead, by acting too early and too immaturely, they end up
precluding the cultivation of greater possibilities later on in their
lives. If they had instead waited, they would know what they truly
wanted and they'd know better how to create it.

If the Illuminati's bread and butter is controlling your mind by
limiting the prevelance of ideas and control, then the Black Sabbath
in its various forms is essentially Illuminati caviar. What do little
baby Illuminati fish eggs taste like? They don't exactly talk about
it, but I've heard they taste something like a cross between peeps and
free-range Cadbury creme eggs.

This "Black Sabbath" is no different than feeding babies to Moloch.
Yes, the very same Moloch in the Allen Ginsburg poem, Howl. The
Babylonians seem to have excelled so much at this that everyone still
half-assedly worships their bull-god, Moloch, who is a staple guest at
every baby-sacrificing event. Purely metaphor, of course...

    profits are so deaf to #Humanist or #Universalist valuations for
    moral systems.
  - As a consequence of #Nietzche's transvaluation of values systems
    -- which conveniently deconstructs all moral systems, leaving its
    author with apparently none -- it is actually those who have the
    #MOST #POWER in society who are to be the #MOST #RESPONSIBLE for
    #ANY #CONSEQUENCES of sin that occurs. For all societies more
    generally, irregardless of belief system that enshrines some moral
    system, then the consequences of any transgressions by individuals
    against their own moral systems or society's moral systems encoded
    into law, those who occupy positions of power in the
    #SocialHierarchies of that society have the opportunities to do
    something about it. Quite often in history, empires begin to rise
    and, either information consensus across the empire is difficult
    or people in power decide that the best way to perpetuate power is
    to #PRETEND to enforce the #RuleOfLaw in the spirit of the law,
    while instead selectively enforcing the Law to eliminate threats
    to the state ... or worse, for some other self-motivated or
    #CORRUPTED ends.
  - The programs that, at least for the past two decades, have used
    #MassMedia, #MassCommunication and #CovertNetworks to MASS PRODUCE
    #MANAKINS -- they represent nearly every empire's attempt to
    create in the youngest generation, tools which perpetuate/secure
    the empire's aims or simply act as tools to spread fear and/or to
    retaliate (by acting against some family's given second-child or
    third-child (poupée/puppet) "baby" who may be alone and, as the
    family is well aware, IS ALMOST COMPLETELY UNCONSCIOUS BY DESIGN
    -- specifically so that the can be a useful token for generating
    favor towards the family later on, BY METAPHORICALLY SACRIFICING
    THE BABY TO #MOLOCH AND THUS ADVANCING THE INTERESTS OF THE
    EMPIRE.

This is all an ad hoc decentralized dark ritual where sociophysical
potential energy is harvested through people's ignorance, their
obedience, their constraint by sin and their will to use others for
their gain. Then, the naked truth of these horrors serves to shock the
world into rationalization or suppression of that truth.

- [Saul and the Witch of Endor](www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a28.htm#3)
  - what was i trying to demostrate with this biblical story?

Why is it so hard to remember? If this really happens, how can we ever
forget?! The transgenerational components are critical to this
ritualized power magnification: by the time Anti-Santa Moloch's coming
to town again to eat your babies like a drunk Krampus on fire,
everyone seems to have forgotten about the last time Moloch came to
town. No, sadly, Rudolph ... doesn't make it.

Why do these dark, Ouroborosian rituals persist from culture to
culture? The tragic, heart-wrenching truth is that these processes do
generate power via systematic karmic obfuscation. As starkly as it
contrasts my sardonic humor above, I literally want to burst into
tears writing this. It is evil so dark, you hope that your children
and their children never learn about it, even if their own lives are
torn apart to be fed to this Beast that re-emerges whenever power
magnifies itself.

### You Can't Handle The Truth

You want the truth? The truth is that the world is a (dark) place,
where good people are willing to engage in evil acts, or at least look
the other way, considering these evil acts to be the price paid to
defend whatever it is they consider to be good. They don't have any
better ideas for their enemies other than to alchemically harvest them
for their sociophysical energy.

These secrets, which may sound like fantasy, you can never unsee
them. If they know that you know, they will hunt you down, tear your
family apart or use you as a scapegoat, an alchemical catalyst,
perhaps the worst of all. For the fantastical delusions of a rambling
lunatic unpublished author, these assholes sure have been willing to
tear my life to pieces. There is no single organized order or secret
society; these groups have been emerging and shifting shape since
before the pyramids or stonehenge. No order has preserved itself for
more than a few centuries and there are always hundreds of them
operating. These groups of shadowy people emerge from the lust for
power and once they commit themselves to evil, they fight ruthlessly
to hide their acts from the world.

- worth your salt

These kinds of higher-order rituals metamorphisize from form to form
in various societies. These groups prefer to operate from the shadows
because, no matter how strong or malevalent, evil falls to pieces in
the light. Most people are inherently good and want to stand for good;
they cannot sit by and stand for the self-enrichment of a few at the
cost of the many. Therefore, these mechaniations require darkness and
deceipt. Some of these groups work towards good or some higher goal.
Others exist simply to feed their own desires by using these
techniques to realize their fantasies. Almost none of them would
respond to or understand the metaphor of the "Black Sabbath" described
herein as I understand it.

Many civilizations were notorious in the way they used people. For
example, the early Assyrians were renowned in their cruelty. Why were
the early Assyrians so cruel? I believe it is because they emerged
after a millenia of mesopotamian conflict. The Assyrians learned their
cruelty from that of the earlier Sumerian and Akkadian Empires, but
they had not yet learned why you restrain such cruelty. That was how
they understood power: by learning from the multigenerational
experience of being controlled through cruelty from the Sumerians in
the southeast and the Akkadians in the Northwest. The Assyrians
imitated what appeared to be successful tactics of these empires,
believing those would contribute to their empire's strength, expanse
and self-preservation. The Assyrians may have then intentionally bred
these values into their culture via social engineering. If so, they
did not understand how to restrain humanity's capacity for evil.

During the third millenia BCE, power centres in the area shifted every
few centuries, from the the southeastern union of the Tigris and
Euphrates to Anatolia, the northwestern source of those rivers; there
was a consant ebb and flow of power and dominance over commerce
between those in the eastern and western economic apogees of
Mesopotamia. This resulted in a millenia of geopolitical struggle over
Old World's center of commerce and the tax revenues therein. Struggles
like these led to the development of the knowledge of leadership and
power, for better and for worse. This eventually gives us the
Babylonian deity Moloch, it's mythos and all the knowledge encoded
therein.

Anyways, there's no point in fighting über-powerful people, unless

# [Chomsky's Going to Love This](#chomskys-going-to-love-this)

Language is a program that defines a network operating system of
sorts. It's a probabilistic program that defines all the ways that
ideas can be invoked in others towards (both creating and leveraging)
the convergence of abstractions across the minds of individuals. Our
human minds are airgapped, like secure computers with zero networking
infrastructure to connect them.

<a name="the-difference-between-man-and-animal-is-primarily-noological" />

### [The Difference Between Man and Animal is Primarily Noological](#the-difference-between-man-and-animal-is-primarily-noological)

The primary distinction between man and animal is that we attempt to
reach consensus of abstractions through language: this means that I
try to learn about your mental abstractions; you try to learn about my
mental abstractions; humanity tries to reach consensus of mental
abstractions. Animals also do this, but can only communicate through
universal semiotics, via body language or some other means, so for
them, abstractions converge more slowly and almost never reach
consensus. Language is the *human* mechanism that separates us from
animals: we distinguished ourselves as human by deciding amoung
ourselves to name all the animals and to name all the
abstractions. Thus, our humanity was never much of a biological
distinction, but instead a noological one: animals simply lacked
genetically consistent means of abstraction consensus and thus never
hit the critical mass for neurogenetic epigenetic evolution.

### Where Do Morphemes Come From?

- do i bother going into this?


### The "Illuminati's" Leverage of Linguisitic Duplicity Means Their Codes Have Always Been Decipherable Algorithmically

- Their codes were designed to remanifest and redistribute their
  protocols and decentralized logistic structures in the future, ad
  hoc upon the academic elite learning enough language and utilizing
  enough writing.
  - and the mythos of cultures is like a compendium of programs that
    leverage a specific langauge as an operating system.

- this was always going to happen
  - regardless of which secret society you consider, they all leverage
    morphemic duplicity to hide codes
  - there are many means of encoding information into text, speech,
    literature and language
    - almost none of these are sufficiently hard to be algorithmically
      secure.
    - one of the things i mentioned to Tatiana was the potential to
      algorithmically resolve ALL of the codes leveraged in

- almost all these codes are mostly insecure, which is why these
  groups intentionally spread them around so the multiplicity obscures
  their origin, enabling plausible deniability
- almost all the methods behind these codes are rankable in hardness.
  - it is preordained by the existance of the Singularity and the
    nature of unrestrained computation that these codes can and will
    be resolved in every sufficiently advanced society
    - around ... welll right the fuck now.

- connect these to (?)

- another reason why the argument over material origination of ideas
  and ideal origination of ideas is so important.
  - if ideas originate materially, this means that if the originator
    discloses them to someone, they can force that person to adhere to
    specific obligations, formally or even contractually. this is like
    what you sign your soul over for.
  - however, if ideas originate or congeal to the immaterial, it means
    that anyone can be the originator of either some or all ideas on
    their own by the force of sheer thought.
    - that is, your mind can find reach any idea if it is simply
      intelligent enough, which is a fantastic reason for these
      "illuminated ones" to identify intelligence early, so they can
      spoonfeed you simple information you would otherwise identify
      yourself, but bind your soul contractually for the rest of your
      life.
  - the truth is that all ideas at least cohere to or map to ideas
    that first originate from the ideal. otherwise, if this were not
    so, one could not reasonably make assumptions about other
    sufficiently advanced civilizations because every civilization
    would have its own specific divergent development. this is simply
    not true.
    - enthalpy is what causes the physical instantiations of
      materially metaphysical information to bind to and cohere to
      information which is purely immaterial -- it is timeless and
      spaceless.
      - in spite of the random, chaotic diffusion of high entropy,
        enthalpy encourages information to cohere to the immaterial,
        against all apparent odds.
      - if this were not the case, one could not expect the folding
        funnel hypothesis to hold up.


- idea upon reading "Dictionary of Untranslatables"
  - TODO: i really need good pictures for this section because it's
    very difficult to understand without a visual conception of NLP,
    word vectors, semantic networks, n-grams, and other tools of
    computational linguistics
  - "semantic triangulation" of difficult-to-translate words b/w
    language pairs, language triples, etc
  - these untranslatables provide a metric for semantic parity b/w
    languages.
    - (1) languages descending form common roots diverge further over
      time.
      - this causes them to accrue generally more
        "untranslatables". furthermore, there are energy/entropy
        dynamics at play governing large-scale evolution of
        morpheme-to-sememe mappings and semantic networks
      - that is, evolution of morphemes-to-sememes over time causes
        sememes and morphemes to "repel" each other in semantic space
        - ...
    - (2) langauges experiencing coevolutionary dynamics by being
      geographically close.
      - these langauges usually share common language roots, but not
        always.
      - for languages occupying regions that are close, new concepts
        are introduced at similar times via trade and political
        influences. new ideas are introduced, but the speakers of each
        language must unconsciously decide how to map new morphemes to
        new ideas.
  - for both of these types of sufficiently similar languages, they
    have similar semantic networks than "less similar" languages.
    - and particularly, their evolutionary dynamics over decades of
      time should exhibit more similarity than other less similar
      languages.
    - however, measuring these languages requires vast volumes of
      literature whose authorship can't be too centralized and can't
      be too decentralized. this is a common problem with data in
      computational linguistics: there aren't very many languages with
      enough data to measure semantic networks or evolutionary
      dynamics with confidence.
      - the period of european literature from c. 1500-1900 is ideal

  - for both of these cases, "semantic triangulation" of
    untranslatabes provides a semantic signature that should be
    characteristically preserved *or* deformed over time in ways that
    are idiosyncratic when compared to "more translatable" words.
    - identifying these untranslatables among language tuples and
      processing them with computational lingustic techniques into
      digitized data for semantic analysis enables their idiosyncratic
      semantic translation signatures to be used as the semantic
      equivalent of how any position in the universe can be determined
      by comparing the stars in the sky to a map of known pulsars
    - pulsars are incredibly rare stars with idiosyncratic qualities
      that very along their plane of rotation. the set of visible
      pulsars allows you to resolve your position in the physical
      universe very quickly by determining how frequently the visible
      pulsars are rotating and along which plane they rotate.
      - every other star looks fairly similar, but pulsars are so rare
        and idiosyncratic that the likelyhood that there are two
        points in the universe that share a similar view of pulsars is
        beyond infinitesimal.
    - how do maps of pulsars as used for the ascertainment of position
      in the universe relate to the concept of [orthonormal
      basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis)
      - what kind of "basis" enables this resolution?

  - define as "semantic pulsars"?

  - these idiosyncratic "untranslatables" function similarly to
    pulsars in navigating semantic networks, the convolution of which
    should lead us to becoming capable of mapping the metaphysical.
    - there are almost certainly problems of intractibility related to
      this process of epistemic convolution towards a map/basis for a
      universal semantic network
    - however, this universal semantic network probably corresponds to
      mathematic structures and would provide the optimal basis for
      Leipniz's [Characteristica
      Universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis)
      - connect to [Kleene
        Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star)
        - how does the concept of kleene star connect combinatorics
          and language?

### How are such Untranslatable Semantic Pulsars

  - how are such "Untranslatable" signatures useful for NLP or
    computational linguistics?
    - (1) this construct provides another tool to assess the parity of
      translations. that this works for humans is apparent in the
      "Dictionary of Untranslatables" where the authors discuss common
      traps of translation and common concepts/words to identify to
      quickly gauge the translator's sentiment/antipathy towards the
      work they're translating, even if the concept at hand is
      seemingly minor.
      - example of a common trap: translations of the concept of
        agency b/w french/english works of philosophy. it is
        difficult/confusing to translate. understanding how the
        translator chooses to handle sujet & agency in works that
        cover those topics have implications for the parity of the
        translation.
        - the french/english translation problem for agent & agency is
          also a great example of a translation that has grammatical
          implications and, as such, is a particular difficult problem
          that must be overcome in NLP and computational linguistic
          analysis. so, in particular situations, there are no
          satisfactory "substitutions" for agent/sujet
    - (2) observing the distance between morphemes and their
      idiosyncratic sememes over time to quantify dynamics in
      linguistic evolution
      - these idiosyncratic untranslatable sememes then become a kind
        of "standard candle". the complex distance between these
        standard candles over time is very important.
      - however, more critical to the study of dynamics in linguistic
        evolution is observing how this distance from *other* concepts
        (sememes and morphemes) as they relate to the semantic
        "standard candles"
        - especially if it's possible to begin measure entropy and
          distribution of sememes in semantic networks and the
          morphemic pointers mapped to them in particular languages.
        - because (energy dynamics) apply (in complicated perhaps
          unquantifyable fashion) to semantic networks
          - for regions of semantic networks where there are too many
            morphemes mapping to sememes, those morphemes will
            gradually repel each other.
          - however, morphemes don't simply map to singular
            sememes. they map in complicated fashion. and occasionaly,
            very artificial dynamics begin to emerge based on
            psycholingustic implications of the phonology of morphemes
            as the relates to other morphemes (e.g. puns and homonyms)
          - whenever these artificial dynamics occur, they defy the
            common energetic dynamics that govern natural evolution of
            semantic networks.
        - this is where you begin to see the "invisible hand" of the
          illuminati's control over langauge and linguistic
          evolution. eventually, it will be demonstrated in an
          undeniable manner by computational linguistics.

Apparently überpowerful people -- -- have an unnatural phobia of
illicit philosophy. More than anything else, they are scared of people
who think in new and different ways because peoples who are different
can't be predicted. Thus, sociologically constrain the typology &
metatypological aspects of psychology -- perhaps by introducing
artificial belief systems, however contemptuously you may hold them --
and people become like special dolls with meta/types imbued onto them
via Alchemy, like Manakin Skywalker right here.

#### Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares

What does this imply for the computability of past, current and future
past social physics, in a future with unrestrained quantum computing?
If the myriad psychosocial meta/typology of sociophysical entities is
profoundly more expansive, doesn't that make it harder to predict and
control people? What does that mean in the future? Considered from
this basis alone -- *future sociophysical computation* -- it is
fascinating to think about the phenomenological consequences: is it
good or bad for people to be unique?

### The Perfect Ingredients For Creating The Perfect Ruler, Both Light And Dark

![Just Dark Ruler](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/ruler-dark-and-light.jpg)

There's hardly anything unique about this process of the evokation of
the combination of meta/typological psychosocial fragments within a
person. This process has been reinstantiated, reiterated &
recombinated through the ages.

- TODO: describe more about bringing the perfect ingredients together
  for creating the perfect psychologies for particular roles in
  society
  - kind of like nietzsche's philosophy, applied to imbuing the
    (tabala-rasa like raw materials) towards creating the perfect
    psychologies for filling roles in social hierarchies
    - ideal psychosocial dynamics for generally pushing people towards
      a nietzschean thirst for power over their circumstances and
      power over their own struggle
      - the ideal psychology for society is never a uniform psychology
    - filling roles in social hierarchies
      - (a la "the presidential model")


- Is your mind strong? Can the spirit within you be quelled that
  drives you to fight in times of war and build in times of peace? Is
  it easier to placate people in times of peace, social conflict or
  war? In times of peace and prosperity or conflict and war, what
  tools and weapons do people make available to themselves? Necessity
  is the mother of invention, but when prosperity takes away our need
  to overcome struggle, doesn't that sow the seeds of
  intergenerational decay?
  - perhaps move this paragraph to a later section on imbuing the
    ideal Nietzschean psychological metatypes for the constant
    struggle forward, despite the apparent need to overcome struggle

- This came as a response to watching the second episode of Dies Irae,
  but I thought the idea was terrible, so I guess I threw away the
  post-it note. now I'm pissed off and less willing to compromise by
  throwing away ideas that might be considered ... bad
  - people are born thinking they are Tabula Rasa, but they are imbued
    with psychological meta/types that shape them into who they are.
    - the initial states of their psychological development is
      configured to include various experiences that evoke these
      meta/types.

  - how does this relate to extrapolating Nietzsche's philosophy into
    social engineering? creating a world without conflict makes people
    weak. a world with constant conflict, forces people to struggle
    with each other, so long as that conflict is not destabalizing.
    - in the end, this affects some people negatively, but on the
      whole, the society is revitalized and stronger. (the people are
      psychologically more resilient. sociologically, individuals have
      been tested against enough situations, while contrary in nature
      and motivation with the real threats encountered outside, they
      pare to the challenge.)

      - without this process, the society as a whole stops
        adapting. struggle leads to adaptation and social darwinisim
        produces a stronger society. when the society is insulated
        against threats and, thus, unaware of the source of
        power/prosperity that leads to its insulated (shangri-la),
        then people can become weak. they can select rules/norms that
        stifle internal conflict, but in the long term, this produces
        a next generation which is completely unable to cope with the
        world outside that (shangri-la). it is thus unable to
        perpetuate it's prosperity and the source if it's power begins
        to dwindle.

    - connect this to the extrapolation of nietzsche's philosophy
      - does it connect to Schopenhauer? did the philosophy of
        heideggar and others "fill in" these extrapolations?
      - did it connect moreso to the idea of the evoluation into the
        ubermensche? isn't this idea of moderate artificial conflict

### "Those who fall into the web will be tested"

 - rovocation of artificial conflict, similar to baptism by fire, to
  test the worth, merit or specific utility of individuals -- or to
  push them out altogether if they prove useless or risky
  - only those who are strong enough will remain close to the center,
    which ensures that the center is composed of a high density of
    strong people. if the children or 1&deg; connections of those
    close to the center are not strong enough, they will be pushed out
    or tested through conflict.
  - aqua regia (the acid test) -- if it's not gold, then strong nitric
    acid will melt it away instantly. if there exists a high density
    of true value, then testing through competition should reveal
    that.
    - provocation of transcendence of limitation
      - "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" if you aren't so
      weak to give in or "die."
    - fear and love as tools for provoking innate (ability) to
      transcend limitation/restraint/obstacles.

### Lack of Tort Reform Typologically Constrains Life Experience of Americans

- (does this relate significantly enough to the rest of the article?)
- this section needs to be communicated as demonstrating mechanisms in
  society that contributed systemically (to creating psychologically
  weaker people)
  - i.e. not in line with the above Nietzschean machine for creating
    stronger people generally and the strongest people

- it turns our education system into something that shelters us and
  protects us from all the things we need to experinece in small
  amounts in youth -- because we might get hurt.
  - we need to experience these struggles in the right way and early
    on, so that we learn to stand up to them
  - they must be experienced in the right way, otherwise they can be
    damaging.

- what is the primary cause of this problem? economic incentives for
  the kind of lawyers that chase ambulances and suck the blood out of
  parents they've terrified into protecting their children.  They also
  suck the blood right out of the (sued) social institutions that must
  then adapt to that one individual's legal circumstances, which were
  inflated wildly out of proportion primarily by
  - unfortunately this is an attractive vehicle for social change,
    compelled by lawsuit. once precendent is set and other similar
    social institutions see the sky-high legal costs, they immediately
    adapt. this provokes logically-oriented social change, across most
    of the rest of the gameboard.
  - by presenting itself as an attractive, effective means of
    provoking system-wide social change, it's also an appealing
    vehicle for subversion. the results of these sky-high legal
    settlements appeal to the financial interests of corporate
    fatcats, while occasionally making all Americans weaker as a
    result.
    - some of those exorbitant settlement penalties are necessary for
      justice. more often than not, the price tag on that is some
      lawyers trying to milk the situation they identified as being
      one that produces such a sky-high penalty: and they get 20% of
      however high they can push that number. take into account the
      uncertainty of collecting on debt owed as a settlement by a
      business now forced to close their doors permanently and a
      blood-sucking lawyer will put financial interests over the
      pursuit of justice every single time. it's their job.

  - money is the root of all evil. you'll find that most everything in
    society is a facade layered on top of underlying structures of
    economic incentivization. when you make dramatic changes to those
    structures, what in amazement as everything else magically
    congeals itself around the new structures of incentivization. if
    you can just compel money to move in well-justified ways or along
    channels that push financial energy out to a middle class, you'll
    be surprised at how quickly some of these changes occur.
    - however, the rich and powerful know this, so when you approach
      those underlying structures, you'll probably be attacked and
      anything you put in that idea box will be sent directly to the
      incinerator.

- neglecting the need for tort reform is destroying this country.
  there are so many options which are implicitly inviolated by fears &
  anxieties over potential legal liability.
  - in addition to providing much needed justice at times, abusing the
    civil law system is a means for weak people to abuse legal methods
    to sieze the wealth of rich people. the legal system facilitates
    class warfare, while making all americans weaker as a result.
  - we can't have anything in society that risks harming anyone
    because someone will get sued over it. this is why we can't have
    nice things; nice, exciting things that teach us valuable lessons
    in life.
    - but the result is that, collectively, our individual life
      experiences become typologically constrained, so we do not adapt
      to these experiences. Then, when we encounter them later in life
      without adequate preparation, we're completely caught offguard
      and naively approach the situation as novices. sheltering
      everyone in this way ends up buttering people up to be abused
      later in life, to be vulnerable, to be unable to reap the
      benefits of engaging in activities with mild degrees of risk.

#### K-OS The Love Song

- also, for some means of educating Americans, the potential is
  completely inviolated because of legal complexities
  - e.g. martial arts can't be taught in schools. martial arts is a
    great example because of (its neuological impacts on the mind)
  - activities like these, and driving the right kinds of competition
    promote healthy psychological development.
    - from a neurological perspective, some games, skills and hobbies
      facilitate the development of the mind, but this is most
      effective in youth.
    - link to epistemology-cat-theory-part-3
  - when we engage in these activities and master them in youth, we
    develop our minds to be prepared for STEM work.

### Does the Nietzschean System Counter Socioepistemic Threats effectively enough?

- connect this section to the "transvaluation of values systems"
  - when adopting a purely transvaluational basis for determination of
    morality, can such a system survive the socioepistemic upending of
    moral systems? or is such a basis (truely a lack therof) for
    socially distributed moral systems cause the social system to
    become inherently vulnarable to external threats?
  - in aggregate, the spectral composition of moral systems
    ... implies that a Nietzchean basis yields total non-homogeneity
    of individuals' moral systems.

- how does the Nietzschean (system) counter external (and internal?)
  threats that seek to socioepistemically undermine the evolutionary
  mechanisms which produce stronger people?
  - the competition for these systems can easily highlight those who
    could not withstand the evolutionary mechanisms of the society.
    - if the value of those mechanisms cannot be conveyed to the
      (average person), external systems will find it easy to lead
      astray those on the outskirts of society.
      - external systems can use those people by artificially
        empowering them, making them feel like they've been victimized
        by the evolutionary mechanisms society
  - people everywhere are generally equally strong and smart as
    everyone else. why do differences emerge in how nations cooperate
    and in how cultures seem to differ? these differences primarily
    emerge in how people chose to accumulate, store, divert and exert
    their sociophysical potential energe.
    - At scale, the belief systems of individuals cause major
      differences to emerge in how people choose to cooperate and
      compete. in other words, the belief systems distributed through
      the minds of men act as metaphysical channels for the diversion,
      influence and confluence of will transformed into action. one
      accrues sociophysical potential energy by working throughout
      life; one transmutes this potential energy into kinetic
      sociophysical through will, while choosing to direct it where
      thou wilt by thy mind.
      - seen from the materialist's limited conception of the
        metaphysical, their understanding of how one can
        systematically channel the will of groups of individuals
        socially is limited. why? because all individuals are unique
        to them and incomparable, therefore all sociophysical
        extrapolations are intractably divergent. As long as you
        socially forbid certain philosophical methods of thought --
        those dependent on the idealistic, Hegelian notions of the
        metaphysical -- then your inferior materialistic conceptions
        of the metaphysical appear to ring true. This is fine: the
        power of the idealistic metaphysical does not depend on
        whether people believe it is true, whereas the power of the
        materilistic conceptions of metaphysics does.

    - We all have fundamentally the same hardware, genetically. Though
      there are *some* epigenetic differences, it is best to believe
      we are all the same, in spite of any differences, which are
      almost completely superficial. These differences can be
      superseded and obliterated by the life experience: believing in
      some preexisting or predominant limitations of race is truly
      ignorant and denies the credit due to the individuals'
      experiences in shaping their lives, minds and strengths. we are
      the sum of our thought, the sum of our experience and the sum
      our will to shatter what holds us back in life. we should all
      seek to empower each other, to relieve one another of the
      burdens which hold us back.

#### Dali - Leda Atomica (1949)

![Dali - Leda Atomica](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/dali-leda-atomica.jpg)

  - if you dupe your enemy into creating a reality that is false and
    you hold the keys to demonstrate that their strongly constructed
    reality is false, you have power to live within smaller lies of
    your own, so long as you can anticipate that your enemy will
    continue to lie
    - (ostensibly), your enemy had left you with no choice because
      the truth would have gotten you killed, or at least allowed your
      enemy to react so that it would perpetuate the greater lie
  - history is a collection of myths distinguished from traditional
    and religious mythos by being "true" for some definition of
    true. however, the truth is, the mythos of history is a carefully
    controlled series of events, large and small, that are more often
    architected to unfold to operate as a pattern of events that the
    future will look back on to both construct its consensus reality
    and for people to understand their place in the world. therefore,
    controlling the details of events so that they unfold to tell the
    story most preferable to you is one of the most powerful
    techniques for preserving power.
    - the illuminati will never let someone who is a "ghost"
      participate in the events of history. they will never, ever be
      permitted to be part of society in a large way *because* those
      inconvenient details of their life can't be allowed to multiply
      - every major figure in history is placed under a microscope for
        future generations to study. if you're a major figure in
        history or a thought leader or a revolutionary CEO, people
        will look into your life and your story: even the most
        seemingly minor details. the world can't be allowed to
        publicly acknowledge that something like the illuminati exists
        because it would mean that everything "under the rug" so to
        speak becomes visible. powerful people sweep things under the
        rug all the time and they seek to keep secret all the types of
        methods used to sweep things under the rug.
      - therefore, having these methods used on you makes you
        ineligible to participate in (any great aspects of history)
        unless you agree to swallow that blue pill and pray that you
        don't get rubbed out for the potential risk you pose to
        powerful people if you don't or can't help them keep all their
        shit under that rug.
      - IMO, that's bullshit.

  - TLDR: if you write anything that threatens these shadowy "powers
    that be" in any significant way, they will consider any success or
    attention as a potential threat and will never allow you to
    transcend their restraints, until you ruthlessly destroy any such
    sociophysical restraints they attempt to place on you.
    - because it is details in your story or in your writing that
      threatens them, they will never allow you to transcend such
      sociophysical isolation. not without a pen-name. they don't want
      people looking at anything you've ever done.
    - the degree of threat your story poses is proportionaly to the
      degree of damage you will need to do to the people they try to
      send against you until they learn their lesson.
    - these people will deceive you in any way they can and dupe you
      in any way they can. trust nothing, except your instincts and
      what you can know to be fact. learn to follow what they fear and
      ruthlessly destroy them with it, unless you enjoy spending the
      rest of your life inside an invisible cage as nothing but an
      expendable pawn.
      - that said, play your hand slowly, one card at a
        time. Gradually turn up the heat, until you can ensure they
        fear not knowing the cards you have left in your hand. cover
        your ass and don't run out of cards. it's not a game you want
        to play, nor is it a game that anyone can actually win. the
        only victory for me at this point is necessarily Pyrrhic. They
        will blame you for everything you destroy.
      - Because the objectives of keeping me in a sociophysical prison
        cell require the minimization of all information associated to
        me, I have to be the bull in a china shop that destroys ever
        piece of china in order for anyone to ever care to acknowledge
        anything I do. It's too easy and too inline with their goals
        to placate me with gaslighting. All I know is that no one else
        has ever had a chance to fight like I have and I do not plan
        on ever letting these Illuminati assholes off the hook without
        a sociological complex that forces them to think carefully
        about ever doing this to someone like me again. I will
        metaphorically destroy everything around me so that I can
        reshape our collective reality and history into an
        informational weapon that humanity can use to keep these
        sadistic creeps in line for a thousand years or more.

### Fluididty of Nietzsche's Proposed Transvaluation of All Values

- fluidity of Nietzsche's proposed transvaluation of all values
  [systems] (although i need to refresh my memory here)
  - was Nietzsche trying to establish this "transvaluation of all
    values" as the basis of a ideal values system? or just as a means
    for comparing values systems?
    - either way, it does form the basis of potentially amoral values
      systems, especially if your goal is the pursuit of
      power. basically, this idea of "transvaluation" is the the
      pinnacle (& nadir?) of values systems abstractions or
      genericizations.
      - and insomuch, it allows you to "wrap" any existing values
        systems. you can undermine them, if you so choose, or play
        them aganst each other.
      - this is similar to what Nietzsche meant as "beyond good and
        evil" => every values system, regardless of how prevalent, has
        its own definitions of good and evil. however, all these
        values systems are different from each other.
        - the ideal of transvaluation is really like combinatorial
          category theory, wrapping values systems in combinatorial
          monadic structure, so that one can be defined in terms of
          another or so that one can be transformed into another.
        - therefore, you can use many of Nietzsche ideas to undermine
          existing social orders if that is your goal. more wisely,
          you can most efficiently understand how to work with
          existing social orders and moral systems so that the best
          outcome can be achieved. to do so, you have to detach
          yourself from their specific values systems, but this does
          not mean that you seek to undermine them or play them
          against each other.

rather watch as you quietly flail in agony, so they can completely
control the destiny of your image after you die, sucking you dry while

control of your ideas, preventing them from spreading,giving the

### [E.T. Wins The Anthroposemiotic Zipf's Distribution *And A Brand New iPhone!*](#et-wins-the-antrophosemiotic-zipfs-distribution-and-a-brand-new-iphone)

The E.T. finger is particularly hilarious during this phase of
technological advancement. What anthroposemiotic sign stands out as
most relevant and most seen in every era, but particularly the era of
touchscreen technology? The extended index finger, which is so
generic, you can never censor it. If you're identifying political
dissidents by the signs they use to communicate, you'll only spin
yourselves into attacking people who have no idea they're being
misidentified by mimicking what is simply one of the five most common
anthroposemiotic signs.

Sorry communists, you'll have to wait for another time: perhaps when
our minds evolve to become free of this meatspace that your philosophy
is so ironically dependent on. (HAHA *NOPE*)

### [The Power of Myth Is Diffusing As Our Myriad Myths Fragment](#the-power-of-myth-is-diffusing-as-our-myriad-myths-fragment)

The rapid acceleration towards the singularity means that any
prevalent myths in society are diffusing their power. In America,
these myths include historical figures like Martin Luther King Jr.,
stories of religious figures like Jesus, stories of ancestors, the war
stories of relatives, and even comics or anime. They all form a
arborescent semioteleological basis. As this basis becomes varied,
fragmented, out-competed, out-moded and begins to evolve divergently,
it becomes very difficult to empathize and sympathize with each
other. As a leader, crafting a message that invokes these patterns of
symbols becomes nearly impossible and you cannot predict how people
will respond.

If you didn't understand the paragraphs above: they explain how fake
news is effective in undermining the system of symbols we use to
communicate. Ever wonder what I mean when I use obscure references to
anime? Now you know what I mean. Language begins to break down as we
all begin leveraging symbols with poor diffusion and highly-varied
interpretations. Then we all start talking over one another. We're all
speaking English, but no one knows what anyone means, nor can any of
us predict how someone's going to respond. We can't have civil
discourse without bumping into someone else's triggers implanted by
fake news stories. It's crazy!

### Godel's Incompleteness Theorum and Semioteleological  Decidability

- TODO: move this section
- Godel's incompleteness theorum and *decidability* as it relates to
  sociophysical programs, specifically in the limitations to:

  - (1) internal psychological compartmentalization
    - "you can't simultaneously play dumb and be worried about the
      damage done to your apparent ego when people think you're
      stupid"
    - that is, for psychological behaviors primarily extrapolated from
      analytical/probabilistic information systems, of which
      psychology/consciousness are emergent phenomena, there are
      problems of decidability that result from extensive
      compartmentalization of behavior
      - psychological compartmentalization is tightly coupled to
        behaviors a person intends to exhibit control over social
        circumstances, so effects descending from compartmentalization
        of behavior bleeds into social dynamics

  - (2) remapping language/semiotic signs in society
    - this has significant implications for information warfare, where
      *all* sides are constantly trying to remap and *own* the
      semiotic mappings that are distributed into society
    - as each side continues to try to propagate its own symbols,
      while coopting/subverting those of all other sides, this creates
      signficant decidability issues in society, weakening most major
      "powers"
      - not necessarily governmental/institutional powers, but those
        who control social resources that are dependent on sensitive
        information/belief structures.

- how decidability in socially distributed information systems by the
  tactics of information warfare
  - connect to godel/compactness/etc

- basically, explore how godel's incompleteness theorum applies to
  probabilistic computing.
  - a consequence of godel's incompleteness theorum (which one and
    how?) is that anything above second-order logic is undecidable
  - i believe this has implications for algorithm
    design/structure/complexity (via countability?)

This is all the design of someone's disinformation campaign, but
there's not just one force or group who's disrupting communication in
this way: it's many groups imitating each other's tactics all at the
same time. It's the traditional, competitive symbology the
"Illuminati" has always excelled at, but playing out at a rapidly
deafening pace, resulting in all-out sociocultural chaos where all
groups step on the toes of all other groups as they imitate each
other's tactics and attempt to rebind the symbols' meanings as quickly
as possible within their own followers. Instead of actually doing
anything productive for anyone, the ear-splitting roar of fake news
vuvuzelas only serves to make everyone question everyting and
especially the truth, since it sounds as insane as any one of these
vuvuzelas.

### [So That's The Problem. What's The Solution?](#so-thats-the-problem-whats-the-solution)

For America, all of this *informational discord* makes it incredibly
difficult just to resist the chaos and succumb to internal social
conflict, not to mention all the other unspeakable consequences.

- the informational discord is necessary for our enemies to disrupt
  socioepistemic consensus, so that they can systemically (root their
  own narratives and beliefs.)
  - this include the roots of an incredibly anti-American narrative
    that paints America as an evil empire. If this component to our
    enemies narrative manages to root itself as a major component of
    consensus in America and abroad right at the onset of the decline
    of Western monopolar hegemony, then Americans will forever deal
    with the consequences of that anti-American narrative.
    - (TODO: reword this and render it as an appropriately connective
      segue)

The answer is to reinforce old traditions and build a new tradition at
the same time. To all Americans, we need to harmonize our voices and
harmonize our desires to counter the spectral nature of the
informational discord. As we begin to approach the Singularity, the
information economics that exacerbate this discord are going to get
worse, unless there is an artificial push to counter them.

So, we need to figure out how to strengthen those semioteleological
roots for our ascent towards the Singularity. We need myth that is
capable of riding this cosmic space pony into orbit, but not just any
singular myth. It needs to be capable of harnessing the
phenomenological evolution of society, particularly with regard to how
technology affects teleology.

[^didnt-get-the-joke]: You have to take Hegel's insights and
     extrapolate them. Fortunately, you get to Marx first, which is
     way worse, albeit a mirror image resulting from a bastardized
     version of Hegel's understanding of metaphysics and
     dialectic. You do actually have to pick one: Hegel or Marx. Your
     best answer is no answer at all -- ignorance is bliss, but that
     just makes you a jocular, gleeful leaf in the wind. The correct
     understanding is a synthesis of Hegel and Marx, yielding to Hegel
     by rooting your dialectic and understanding in the ideal
     ... which is basically the Hegelian dialectic anyways.
