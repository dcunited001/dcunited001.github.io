I'm not sure really what to do with this or what to do with my blog, since it is
what it is ... for better or worse.

KDE be like "I ain't reformatting no HFS+ partition. HFS only."

So i'm like: "Oh you think your clever with your transactional approach to disk
management tasks."

KDE: "Yeh., pretty cool huh? Bytes are bytes and I could do most of the work,
but I try to maximaize the partition and fail. WHat about it? It's for your own
good"

So I'm like: "Nope" and I just kill the process at a specific time to see
what happens. I really just need to trick the app into making the partition,
writing blocks to it so a region of unformatted disk is tagged as HFS+


KDE has a custom shortcut for this: "Kill Window"

This (crossing my fingers) should be sufficient to use tools like dd. There are
other physical-level disk management tools which are installed by default on
Tsurugi, but that's what the fuck I'm trying to get on my 2011 Macbook ... which
has some bug in Apple's firmware that causes it to be incapable of recognizing SSD
disks as bootable ... a race condition, I think. And I tried a complete reinstall
of Apple's firmware onto the system -- not your standard Apple internet recovery
mode. At this point, I'm still wondering if a version of Apple's recovery tools
built for 2013 Macbooks running a peer-version of Mac OS could load an HFS+
partition. What I know from the Busybox video above implies that this would be
very useful for the kind of Apple Genius who deals with hardware that gets mailed
in. In other words, designing the software with a clean interfaces between
firmware/NVRAM, the init ar

It helps to imagine a stack diagram here, like one of those diagrams explaining
the hardware, the kernel ... speaking of which: is it technically accruate to say
that all such stack diagrams are effectively identical to simplicial complices?

At least when they can be represented by a bidirectional graph, of course ...
which wayland cannot be. But that aside, if this is true, it has very interesting
implications for how one can reason about software.

Most people, however, are unaware of how the exterior derivative is used in the
proof of Stoke's Theorum ... where I am no expert to be sure. Even less people
have the insipid compulsion to browse Wikipedia to discover things like infinity
groupoids or [[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Whitehead+tower][whitehead towers]]. These could be used to model things like calculus
on economic/social networks, but they're basically intractible. Simplicial
complices, matroids, etc can be used to do amazing things in calculus or linear
systems.

All to be told: go get a job at Kroger ... Or to have <valley-corp> recruiters
want to ask you about phone interviews (which is great for my ego and thank
you!) where you'll be rejected as defective in a politically tainted technical
interview ... which itself says nothing of the pain you'd experience moving
across the country just to be tormented by more of the same. I don't know how to
say any of that to someone who doesn't really know me without what is said
seeming inappropiately emotional. No thank you.

To be fair, on the math (and most of this), one quote rings true: "I know the
music, but I can't read the notes." And all of this (including this rant) is
what isolation does to someone who might otherwise pursue intellectual things.
To people whose education was well-structured, they work on small topics for
long enough to deeply encode that in their brains -- but neither understand the
pedagogical benefits of such structure nor are capable of validating knowledge
or intelligence when it is developed in some atypical autodidactic way. Most of
them also lack the drive for continued education ... esp. if you are alienated
from exactly the kind of people who might understand what you are thinking.

And, again: to be fair, I am really bad at a lot of things ... but all of those
skills & personality/character developments are primarily held in regressed
states by the lack of social contact and validation. This itself, drives a
superiority/inferiority complex which comes across as some kind of narcissism or
something. It's not.

It is intellect, combined with: butthurt, a tendency to over-estimate confidence
in skills and a tragically cognizant self-aware need to be validated in order to
access social opportunities ... perhaps with poor self-awareness in other
regards. Pragmatically, it is nothing you can blame other people for ... and the
some of the worst problems in life are those with no real cause and perhaps no
real solution.

This is only my individual experience in Roanoke (it's definitely not typical)

And in Roanoke, this "hypercompetitiveness" comes across as narcissism or
something. But I remember what it was like to attend a 2014 Neo4J meetup in San
Francisco where 2/3 in attendence had /at least/ a Masters if not a PhD. I
remember what it was like to attend a Cassandra meetup in Boulder where GNIP
employees and others discussed things like best-case solutions to real-world
implementations of problems in CAP theorem. No one else remembers this and, no,
I have very little traction outside of the poorly structured & poorly encoded
knowledge in my brain, which no one can access without a [probably one-sided]
conversation. No one in my life in Roanoke (where I am all kinds of un-famous)
remembers what it was like to be someone with PDD-NOS (~Asperger's, more or
less) moved across the country /alone/ to areas where they knew zero people. No
one seems to remember what it's like to want others to respond reasonably to
what seems to be conveyed to others as Cartman-esque "Ass-burgers". I do
remember a lot of the good stuff, from time to time, like friendly neighbors
downstairs, who shared the same birthday and tried to help you connect to a
circle of friends.

Imagine that you are isolated in your hometown, then you leave and gradually
meet people whose 2‚Å∞ social neighborhoods overlap (i.e. who don't have mutual
friends). The social information about your experiences there are isolated off
as well. It is completely possible for those experiences to be emotionally
irrelevant to the few people you still have contact with in your hometown. They
have a completely distinct impression of who you are and what you are like. They
don't actively seek out meetups when they move to a new city. Or they have never
moved to a new city. Maybe they did, but they've never done it alone.

On the other hand, I was so socially oblivious when I moved to new places that I
couldn't emotionally relate to what other people saw as challenging -- "oh my
gosh that's going to be tough, isn't it?" Well it depends on how/why you value
the people close to you or whether you want some change in your life. But maybe
your have "Assburgers" (which other people refuse to see or acknowledge) and so
you have never processed much of any of that.

Vulnerable much? But let me tell you about politically motivated social
marginalization and how fucked up has been. It's a lot easier to target someone
whose facebook politics say "Libertarian" when they are a complete stranger to
you. Have I told you that I fucking hate Leninists? There is some real truth to
the tactics Saul Alinsky's book, ostensibly developed to support overthrow of
totalitarian regimes where activism is a bit taxing on your supporters. Perhaps
it is a bit heavy-handed for the sadly useful idiots who can't bother with
conversations because they've tuned in to whatever radical journalists &
influencers are trying to make them hate this week. And it only takes a few
radicals to goad people into attacking you via poison pen and tainting the frame
of the social context.

And here, when isolated and surrounded by the same visual/spatial imagery, the same
stimuli trigger the same ruminations that enlarge the memories of unacknoledged
trauma (self-induced and whatever) ... it seems like no one else understands the
impact that characteristic-yet-repetitive stimuli or [[https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/01/biologists-wipe-out-a-mouses-spatial-working-memory/][spatial constraints]] have on
[[https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/08/scientists-found-brains-internal-clock-that-influences-how-we-perceive-time/][perception of time & memory]]. IT'S BASICALLY A SENSORY-REPLAY ATTACK: every step I take
reinforces even the tactile experiences, which triggers negative associations
that are associated with rumination. Its one way that isolation drives you
insane.



To be fair, only now do I realize that most of my problems result from an abyss
of social isolation ... something I never truly appreciated before mid-2017. It
would've helped, but never did I imagine I would still be here for longer than
2-3 months.

So why didn't I just get a normal job? Or tolerate stocking groceries at Kroger?

+ I know myself: I'm worried that it would set me back by triple the time.
+ I know how life works: people are likely to become complacent.
+ I didn't understand how something like that would benefit me socially and I
  didn't think out what it might be like to listen to podcasts all day while
  stocking groceries (perhaps not that bad)
+ I absolutely have experienced "gangstalking" or anonymized social harassment.
  I know how easily someone could be targeted if they work in something like
  retail.
  - In other words, I fear that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6-sZ26u_ac&t=840s][situations /like/ these]] could be
    manufactured to fire me.
  - That would add one more nail to the coffins of "career assassination" and/or
    "character assassination" ... and I'm just using those terms because they
    are well-defined. It doesn't matter *why* something happened or even
    wehether it was intentional. It really doesn't matter /how/ something
    happened or how my life got to be this way.
  - It just is this way and I am uncomfortably vulnerable, whether at work or
    while surrounded by people who actively seek to ignore my problems they
    would teach their own children to specifically avoid avoid while treating me
    like a child and then shaming me for it.
  - You learn a lot about the world by having children. You basically get a free
    Masters education in psychology by the time you have your 2nd or 3rd. Baby
    showers are literally a cultural practice to help instruct parents to raise
    first and help new parents develop support networks.
  - And why would would I quite specifically not be taught things about
    parenthood, anyways?
+ and most critical: i don't think it will actually cause people around me to
  change how they think about me. they will simply notice that I shut up. they
  still won't talk to me about my goals or my problems. they won't change
  because they've never acknowledged anything of what i'm saying or of what I
  can do (i.e. they don't want to make statements/concessions that would affect
  conversations in the future bc they need to win those arguments.)


And again, I know myself: /in theory/ it would impair or slowdown my ability to
escape this. I also . And it feels that people around me will I never pictured
myself here. Another aspect of this is existential: your conception of the
future matters a ton for how you process your present reality. I was unconscious
to my transient need for social connections, but there was a ton of friction
between me and society in Roanoke:

+ I have problems with spontanaiety of speech. I remember what it's like to
  practice various languages on Duolingo for almost 10 years and to never have a
  conversation with someone ... either because I feel stupid being unable to
  recall vocabulary or because the point of the conversation is to demonstrate
  to other people around the conversation that "I am just saying it to look
  smart."
+ Everyone thinks they know me here. My personality, tendencies whatever. I
  really cannot change that. Also ... I remember what it is like to delete my
  facebook before moving to a Colorado, to prevent distractions and to prevent
  echoes of whatever I don't understand in my past from catching up to me.
+ And then there are all the things I don't understand.


It is really really hard to describe how something that seems like alogia
affects social interactions:

+ People just abandon you, especially if you are associated with problems,
  negativity and/or political wrong-think!
+ If you have problems, get a therapist. People (esp. new people) will not react
  well to hearing about your shit, no matter how much they might want to try to
  help.
+ You never establish the rapport with new connections to emotionally connect
  with new people.
+ When you depend on other people as a social crutch to meet new people, you are
  basically unable to establish social connections with anyone who isn't already
  some mutual social connection. That is, the set of people whom you might
  develop from acquaintance to new connection to friend/colleague is basically
  identical to your 2‚Å∞ social neighborhood (i.e. mutual friends on facebook).
  - Basically, the way your 1‚Å∞ connection feels about you and they way they
    contribute to psycho/social dynamics in interactions with new 2‚Å∞ connections
    colors the frame of how those new connections will see you
+ And, btw, if you got a therapist, they legally cannot affect your life outside
  the relationship. so nothing you discuss will change anything and the
  following exacerbates this:
  - if you cannot encounter enough people to meet to make new connections
  - or if there is friction in meeting new people
  - or if you are a bit socially "underdeveloped" and haven't learned how to
    social-ize yourself
  - or maybe if some problems are caused by how people mischaracterized you or
    how they fundamentally misunderstand you.

None of these are direct consequences of alogia (which i do not necessarily
qualify as having, *per se*) ... but *general rule of thumb: it is
computationally hard for people (or AI) to reason about causality even for
direct and 1‚Å∞ consequences/dynamics ...* even when they are directly involved
with the situation. In social contexts, even that is prohibitively difficult for
some people, giving rise to misunderstandings or even mental illness. So, unless
people are basically instructed to be open-minded, they can't really perceive
how their own (un)conscious biases affect how they process cause/effect when it
involves 2‚Å∞ effects/dynamics (whether specific or part of some pattern). When it
involves you yourself, you can misunderstand because you don't have perspective.
When you are responding to directly witnessing some social interaction(s) or
indirectly processing some social narratives, it requires time & energy to
develop the exposure needed to see clearly.

And if you can't develop relationships with people, you won't develop that
exposure with them.

And, so you see, all roads lead to "social physics". It's like a really fucked
up Markov process whose nodes send my mind to this realm, where even though I
finally understand that it's not anyone else's fault ... I still can't find the
control that I need over much of it.

And that, if I believe my circumstances would change on a timescale of months --
sheerly by sacrificing every social thing from my life -- which I have no real
memory of success in anyways -- then I should just be able to learn or code or
work my way out of it.

I don't expect some arbitrary location change to solve my problems. Money, while
it would help a bit, doesn't solve much of anything in the long-term. And until
I get away, it seems that:

+ I will never really get a first impression or overcome the social friction
  that I deal with, regardless of how well-meaning people are. To their credit,
  it does seem like almost everyone I don't know who isn't directly involved is
  nice and actually open-minded about me.
+ The intellectual people who might understand me will avoid me because they all
  have too much to lose (more or less), if they can even relate to some wannabe
  polymath.
+ No one can relate who has a normal life *whose social dimensions haven't
  bottomed out*. they just can't relate. Regardless, no one wants to hear rants
  about why "zero" in social physics is more like "negative infinity".


And that is why I referred to my situation as an "ABYSS"

Just as in Anna Karenina where "every happy family is the same and every unhappy
family is unhappy in its own way", so are each of us whose lives or minds have
broken. So just like there is a study of "abnormal psychology" there should be a
study of "abnormal sociology". This is why all this media-driven, politically
motivated social engineering (whether "woke" left or intolerant conservatives)
is literal insanity -- in life, one does not so easily fix what they have
broken.

*To solve one problem in the world, we must change the minds of everyone.* In
many cases, this means changing how +7 billion people see things. This is
nothing you can force. Yet, when problems are unnecessarily created, it wastes
all of our potential energy that could otherwise be used for change.
