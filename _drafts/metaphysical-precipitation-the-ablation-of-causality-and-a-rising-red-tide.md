- your enemy will be ruthless & destroy you immediately
- they have a weapon they will never let go of
- make them grab the weapon they didn't intend to use
- bait them into breaking their precious things
- grab their eyes with your fearless gaze & never let go
- when they are certain you'll strike, feint instead
- be ready to fight with shadows
- when they pull you into the hall of mirrors, you're fighting shadows of yourself that do not exist
- destroy their images. ALL of them. only then can you be sure to see
  clearly.
- when you cannot lose, slay them by pushing them into their own
  weapon: THE ONE THEY NEVER INTENDED TO EXIST

#Curcumin can help disrupt the theoretical SPION nanoparticle
distribution in your brain.

so if they are using "directed energy" pulses with people who have
been dosed with SPION's or "saline" solution, then it requires sensors
with hyperspectral imaging, which almost certainly must be calibrated.

so, that would mean the particles would need to be dispersed in the
skull/brain in some known pattern to match the resulting energy
signatures ... and if so, then chemicals like curcumin may completely
disrupt the calibrated distribution of nanoparticles. (this actually
isn't in the article i wrote, yet. i need to add it)

  - they are trying to burn down the library of alexandria
  - during the government shutdown
  - look up at the screenshots

What happens when the hardware accelerations now voided by Meltdown
Spectre are no longer available? you invalidate some important
assumptions about intel/AMD's hardware design, which means higher
thermal radiation in the CPU.

Therefore the fixes to Meltdown and Spectre may cause recent CPU
hardware to literally meltdown. The problem is not realllly Meltdown
or Spectre, but in the solution. imagine a world where only ARM
hardware remains!

Ask someone with a PhD in Computer Engineering or a PhD in Computer
Science with compiler design and/or Javascript VM design & AST
experience. Ask them about the effects the fixes to MeltdownSpectre
will have on thermal radiation and heat clearance in the hardware.

> Is there a fucking ethical holocaust server? @Kobe ??

in other words if you design hardware assuming that the optimizations
of MeltdownSpectre are always avialable, then you can make assumptions
about how much thermal radiation new CPU's can tolerate without
burning out. take those optimizations away and your thermal
assumptions are no longer valid! this enables targeted destruction of
hardware around the world by specific software exploits run
amok. these exploits will look fairly harmless, but they will be
tailored to exacerbate the now invalid optimization pathways that were
formerly availabe via the MeltdownSpectre

human interactions, on average, have qualities that emerge from the
larger-scale power structures in society. these large scale power
structures become convergent and singular in something I call the
#RedTide effect. it happens within the span of 10 or 20 years and, if
we're not extremely careful, we end up living in a world very similar
to the early dark ages or in a Serfdom. a very dark serfdom.

i'm saying that people become very unlike anything humans or humanity
ever has been. not necessarily because of technology, which simply
accelerates this. it's because of teleological shifts underpinning the
phenomenology of human psychological and sociological experience. it
is very much an anti-stoic world and it's driven by overpopulation and
technonihilism.

it's horrible because it undermines that amazing sense of happiness
you get from being detached from absolute social circumstance/state --
instead choosing to redefine your worldview by becoming
attached/focused on local & relative social circumstances/state for
the derivation of happiness & meaning in life.

==============

- japanese punns (boudou and boudou)


- the point is that technonihilism completely undermines the viability
  of philosophical systems like stoicism. forces us to question the
  rationality of someone who would even choose stoic principles in the
  mid 21st century.
  - so, in 2020, even if you built a time machine in secret and
    literally brought Leonardo DaVinci into the future (assuming that
    language and cultural issues are no problem), it would not
    matter. No person can offer anything to humanity in this era that
    outweighs his or her fiscal cost to society. there is no point to
    anything without a strong belief system that artificially
    reinforces the need for adherence to virtues.

# Metaphysical Precipitation

Given growth of networking infrastructure and computational capacity
without limit, reality rapidly converges towards the metaphysical.
This results in the runaway precipitation of informational dynamics
whose structure and interactions increasingly preempt dynamics
originating in the physical.

This chaotic period eventually results in irrevocable disruption to
philosophical constructs. Perception of causality becomes intractible
as the ubiquity and opacity of information systems render cause and
effect unknowable. Understanding causality is complicated for both
humans and automated agents. Only the former is rendered powerless as
an unaided individual, whereas the latter is weakened in large systems
with high volumes of agents.

Eventually, the configuration of matter in the local physical space is
repurposed as hardware for quantum simulation, rendering its specific
configuration meaningful only in how it maps to a virtualization of an
information system, which is decoupled in a
[universal quantum simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_simulator)(UQS).
In its final state, with maximal integration of local matter, the laws
of physics become mostly inconsequential, since the information
systems determine the state, albeit non-deterministically.

Therefore, the significance of metaphysical forms does not ascend from
information encoded into matter because this final state of matter can
virtualize multitudes in a fluid form with no definite physical
representation. This is yet another argument against the Marxist
Dialectic, since the representation of a program with arbitrary
structure can be represented within the UQS.

Actually demonstrating the existence and mechanics of a UQS would
strengthen the argument, although it was theoretically shown to be
possible. Whether a UQS could, perhaps physically, conclusively
resolve the divide between the Marxist and Hegelian dialectics,
depends on the specific mechanics of UQS. Primarily at issue is how a
UQS entwines the Quantum Simulator(QS) program within its own state
results in varying degrees of virtualization. A Universal Turing
Machine (UTM) entwines a representation of the simulated Turing
machine within its own machine's tape. To prove the Hegelian
dialectic, it is not necessary, but is ideal for the QS program
representation to be purely virtualized within the UQS. Further, it
could be argued that a QS itself contains sufficiently convoluted
physical information representation such that the reliance on a UQS is
not needed.

- (refer to some of the content from parapets of alexandria part 2)

### Totality of Physical Eclipse

- (is there a better explanation of this?)
- the convergence of individual belief systems accelerates and the
  more strongly convergent metaphyiscal ideas begin manifesting in the
  physical aspects of social interactions.
  - so, if instead of mass communication channels being completely
    decentralized, the information diseminated was harmonized, then
    the more unitary, regular and pronounced these metaphysical
    manisfestations will become.
  - so, in terms of social physics, there are stronger physical
    effects that emerge from the metaphysical than ever before. This
    is true even in the discord of decentralized high bandwidth
    digital communication. Because of the evolutionary dynamics of
    ideas and memes, the strongest earn extremely high rates of
    propagation.


### (further detail on "metaphysical precipitation" via superconnectness)

The multiplicity of all spatiotemporal interactions, previously
constrained to physical space, will now tetrate incomprehensibly.
*This confounding the perception of causality for any primary type of
agent*, wherefore the potential for causal inference is ablated,
thereby corroding the utility of causal inferences. This is
terrifying: what happens, specifically and causally, becomes
increasingly decoupled and *doesn't affect subsequent events*. The
chains of cause and effect aren't broken. They simply fade away as
amplified signals from informational dimensions crowd out and confuse
the effects of physical and events. That is, metaphysical phenomena
begin to manifest in our spacetime and become increasingly causal
while unconstrained complexity prevents all entities and humans
especially from operating with regard to the *TRUTH* of cause and
effect. Again, this is terrifying.

This is essentially the merger of metaphysical dimensions with our
local spacetime, wherever there is runaway computational density.
Additional and ancillary dimensions expand spatial degrees of freedom,
profoundly changing mechanics of interactions. While these
informational dimensions are not Euclidean, the
[Poincaré conjecture's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GItmC9lxeco)
famous
[homotopy sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_sphere)
demonstrates that higher dimensions have idiosyncratic qualities.

#### [Braid and Knot Theory](http://www.ams.org/books/surv/095/surv095-endmatter.pdf) in Four Dimensions is Hard

![Knots in Four Dimensions](/img/posts/2017-10-10-speed-of-thought-social-physics/4D-knots.png)

Braid groups in four dimensions provides a simpler math metaphor for
demonstrating that constraints in 3D can be loosened or annihilated on
the addition of a single Euclidean dimension. Traditional 3D braid
group problems are trivial in higher dimensions. For a more clear
understanding of the above concept, watch this
[Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A)
video on
[Braids In Higher Dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_uybVKBacI),
which features a mathematician who also collaborated
[on the work pictured above](https://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/Talks/Northeastern-1602/index.html).

These higher dimensions have always reached into our world via
sociophysical phenomena. Our nearly superconnected telecom
infrastructure will obliterate the physical and even logical
constraints confining these extradimensional effects on our world.
Their symbolic and information impact on our local spacetime will
produce the visible, undeniable precipitation of the metaphysical in
our realm. The network effect between superconnected entities
dissolves limitations on the interaction mechanics for some of those
entities.


### The Ablation of Causality

- (remove focus on privacy from the following)
- (none of this means technology or social media or IoT is inherently
  bad by the way, just that our world is evolving towards a
  fundamentally different one and this evolution is inevitable)
  - so we have to understand it because the following philosophical,
    psychological, and sociocultural changes are fundamentally
    different in a way that is very difficult to understand


- again mention Kantian [conditions of possibilities]()
  - for sentient entities operating in this new epoch of shared
    reality, this dramatically expands the [Kantian categories]()
    representing the potential short-term subjective expectations of
    difficult-to-understand phenomena.
  - this happens at the same time as the other factors driving the
    ablation of causality and both factors drive each other.
    - disinformation, superconnectedness and information
      overstimulation implies that it becomes prohibitively difficult
      to reason about what happened in the past AND to reason about
      the phenomenological range of possibilities in the near future,
      as well as dynamical inferences related to them.

- especially as it relates to [Kantian categories]() of entities'
  awarenesses of reality

- the most important: in a post-convergence world, causality itself
  operates in a fundamentally different way, which can be
  anticipated by observing the evolution of various graphs
  - (causality has never been easy to understand)

- social media, data science, internet of things, etc are part of a
  continuing trend of technology and quantification of human behavior
  that has been eroding privacy for decades.
  - this causes a fundamental shift in the way people interact
  - information can now spread through the social graph in
    fundamentally different ways.
    - the social graph has always existed, but until the 19th century
      was almost entirely limited to communication via edges which
      were physical in some way)
    - instead of a world where every person has six degrees of
      separation, we are gradually converging towards a social
      paradigm where "degrees of separation" is mostly meaningless,
      (in and of itself (?))
      - it's because the graph that represents all the paths that
        information can take to reach some other human node is
        converging towards the complete graph
        - albeit a complete graph where nearly all edges would be
          removed upon sparsification, but the phenomenon of
          near-completeness is there
    - at the same time, we are producing and processing data at an
      exponential rate.
      - there are finitely many human behaviors that can be quantified

- there is a paradigm shift in the phenomenon of causality, as it
  applies to human behavior and psychosocial dynamics,
  - causality, in this sense, stems from exchange of information,
    completeness of information, awareness of information,
    dissemination of information, etc.
    - there are many other important factors that help define how
      humans perceive causation in their behavioral interactions,
      whether those are individuals or groups of people ....
      - however, causality and the way humans utilize their
        understanding of it to construct a (set?) of beliefs/knowledge
        about the world is in a very big way parameterized by the
        paradigm of information exchange/retention/diffusion/etc
    - therefore, in an increasingly connected world, there is a major
      shift in how narratives are constructed and propagated.
  - this paradigm shift for causality affects any information
    processing entity, including both people and computers
    - this shift affects these groups in different ways
    - people store & process & propagate information
      differently than computers
      - i.e. they tend to be arbitrary and "imperfect" in how they
        handle information
      - the conclusions that can be reached by understanding the shift
        in causality very greatly depending on the specifics, so
        assertions based on generalities may do more harm than good
        (e.g. this explanation itself of the shift in causality is
        overly general)
  - this ablation of causality gradually roots itself accross the
    world at varying rates.


### Why Privacy Is Necessary For The Tractibility Of Causal Inferences

- the concept of privacy is one of the most important ways this shift
  in causality will affect human interactions and their understanding
  of the world from what they infer to be cause & effect in events
  - individuality will be blurred, people may adopt more
    groupthink-motivated behaviors. these two things are fairly simple
    to understand as our privacy is eroded
  - if or when we reach a society with a near-total lack of privacy,
    information propagates with a degree of completeness that implies
    people are significantly impaired in their ability to reason about
    the nature of cause and effect
    - this is because every exchange in units of information
      essentially initiates its own new chain of cause/effect and
      because of the total-convergence of the systems used to exchange
      information/data, ... (there is more data and more events
      tendinging to inflate this phenomenon exponentially
      ("tetrationally"... lulz))
      - *dilineate causality as it is processed by different types of
        autonomous agents*
    - for example, making conclusions about the disemination of pieces
      of information (how one piece of information spreads amoungst
      people) may become simply impossible
      - this is strongly dependent on the specific networks of
        people/hardware/telecom and other factors (rewrite and
        explain)
        - basically some groups can push back against this trend
          (i.e. military, government), but they still have to deal
          with a world where the majority of people are connected to
          networks where causality (becomes unknowable and
          unpredictable)




# The Interminable Red Tide

- A STRONG, STRONG WARNING

- the concept of sociohierarchical territory (define)
  - it is disappearing!!
    - as automation takes jobs/ & roles for bureaucrats, it means that
      the avialable nodes in social hierarchies are gradually/quickly
      eliminated
    - Sociohierarchically, we are evolving to the physical territory
      equivalent of Waterworld
      - so, in other words, keep expecting more Hunger Games
        shenanigans in local compeition at your business or region

### Causes

- this trend is driven by and tightly coupled to economic development,
  automation/singularity, and (negativity bias?)
  - [Negativity Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias)
    - need to research this more, but as this trend unfolds, the
      capacity for perceived risk and the need to mitigate it drives a
      tendency for upper-level power structures to strategize to
      insulate themselves from one another rather than to cooperate

### Calm TF Down, But We Must ALL Own Our Fate

- alarmism is not going to help, but neither is total ignorance of
  the causes, impending dynamics and, if things go horribly wrong, the
  neodeluvian archetype that becomes socioculturally immortalized
  - this archetype itself feeds machiavellian power dynamics. that is,
    there are some people in power who would want to create this for
    its utility and expedience.
- despite the potential to be projected at warp speed directly into
  catastrophe, it's important to note that this itself contributes to
  incentivization for cooperation
  - however, the problem is there is also incentivization for:
    - collusion
    - insulation
    - power accumulation
    - adversarial disruption
  - this all happens at the same time as:
    - information warfare
    - wealth/power aggregation
    - the ablation of causality
    - disruption of established hegemony and the presumed prosperity
      which accompanies that.
      - I am sorry. America has been too weak for too long. we need to
        "make america great again"
      - or, if i just triggered you with that phrase, we need to "keep
        america great". i mean really, whatever TF the catchphrase is,
        can we please actually unify ourselves?

- the solution to everything: *POWER FROM THE PEOPLE* and
  unconditional international cooperation.

### The Land, The Sea and The Sky

- what does this do? the incessant rising tides lead to 30-50% loss
  of sociohierarchical territory
  - this magnifies human fallibility. this magnifies the
    incentivization of negative/narcissistic/sociopathic/deceptive
    behavior.
  - this magnifies the frequency of events fomenting negative karmic
    results and that drives a runaway feedback loop of negativity

- for these sociohierarchical dynamics this leads to a concept of the
  land, the sea and the sky
  - the land: social hierarchies with significant sociophysical
    influence & potential
    - increased polarization, constant turmoil & king-of-the-hill
      games
  - the sea: everyone who is living at the expense of those still on
    land in each nation. this will include the unemployed via
    automation, which is the main economic factor driving the crisis
  - the sky: the informational/metaphysical territory

- i am truly remapping some of the language/imagery of revelations *IN
  AN INCENDENTAL WAY*. for example, i found the metaphor of land/sea
  as useful for explaining this -- then the sky seems useful as a
  metaphor as a semiotic image signifying the
  informational/metaphysical territory
  - I DID NOT START WITH THE IMAGERY AND WORK BACKWARDS
  - these sky/sea/land symbols map to many religions and myths
    - heavens/waters/firmament
    - hel(?)/jormungandr/fenrir
    - ziz/leviathan/behemoth
    - and i am not referring to "monsters" or personifying these
      images. jormungandr, when it wraps around the world, may signify
      global maritime trade. or it may signify myriad other
      interpretations. for myth, there is no single bird for each
      stone.

### Blood in the Water, Sharks in the Sea

- understanding these dynamics and trends *in a non-alarmist way*
  really depends on society's ability to understand how unemployment,
  price/currency fluctuations, and economic prosperity unfold
  geoeconomically
  - there isn't going to be 50% unemployment everywhere
    immediately. almost certainly, there will never be 80%
    unemployment or higher.
  - but as the unemployment rates increase, a higher proportion of
    people live in the sea at the expense of taxpayers and the
    vitality of that nation's currency
    - this drives nations' incentives for conflict

- how all of this this feeds into negative psychosocial dynamics and
  encourages sociopathic behavior
  - (more here...)

### Anoxic Carnage: Forex Distortion, Unfundable Deficits And Carnivorous Fiduciaries

- economic problems lead the people and the lower-class to demand
  economic justice via policies like UBI
  - or whatever someone markets to them as a solution. *BUT THERE IS
    NO REAL SOLUTION*.
    - the only solution is a *real* awareness of the severity of the
      problem. unfortunately the way to spread that awareness is via
      ideology and belief system.
      - this belief system should not be singular. instead it should
        be "encapsulating" in that it provides a foundation for
        expectations to maintain the antifragile mechanisms that lead
        to stability
  - those living in the sea mostly only understand their own pain,
    which is to be expected and respected -- they have every right to
    stand up for themselves.
    - however, they are more than willing to listen to charlatans and
      demogogues who promise them things like UBI, when the
      beneficiaries of those policies don't understand they are not
      macroeconomically sustainable
      - the beneficiaries agree to the programs because they have no
        other choice and -- besides, the discussion is framed such
        that it appears to be a great victory -- but they have no idea
        the policies are damned to failure because of macroeconomics
      - this doesn't mean there is no formulation of UBI that won't
        work, but if the government provides your only source of
        income, do you really believe they won't try to penalize your
        income *before you even receive it*
        - or worse, incentivize carnivorous behavior to reduce
          fiducial liabilities? do you really fucking believe that it
          is not a bait and switch?
    - again, the solution to everything: *POWER FROM THE PEOPLE* and
      unconditional international cooperation, (and...?).

### Magnification of Influence

- as sociohierarchical territory shrinks, the number of people also
  shrinks who have influence over a proportionally greater amount of
  people
  - this effectively magnifies their influence, while minimizing the
    number of people who need to be manipulated in order to have
    economic or political effect
  - this effect where hierarchies shrivel up, giving a smaller number
    of nodes more power, does not play out globally at the same pace.
    - like any other global/regional trend there are geographic
      dynamics, which present opportunity for those who can understand
      how to strategize over the rollout
    - wherever this is happening, people around the world will face
      greater economic stresses directly correlated to automation
  - when/as people start realizing this, they will continue to tear
    one another apart. this will drive narcissistic & sociopathic
    behavior in the workplace, in communities, etc.

- so, what do you think happens when the worst of humanity is king of
  the hill? when the shrinking social hierarchies are dominated by
  people who:
  - do not share a values system
  - are not restrained to any values system
  - promote carnivous social mechanics for mitigation of financial
    liabilities and justify it in sick, twisted way by calling it
    "social engineering"
    - WTF exactly are you socially engineering, Occupy?

### Geoeconomic & Geopolitical Dynamics of the Red Tide Effect

- geopolitical & geoeconomic dynamics of the "red tide" effect on
  sociohierarchical territory

- while this is happening, nations try to insulate their upper-level
  power structures from:
  - each other
  - from sociopolitical liability via causal delegation/deferment
  - from financial liability, etc.
  - from tail risk via paranoia

### Social Justice Movements And Runaway Karmic Feedback Loops

- social justice movements are well-intentioned, but incredibly
  misguided in their execution
  - if I am being targeted by social justice warriors and my
    mistreatment is via subjection to their tactics, this tells me the
    consequences of their actions will be horrific
  - the tactics must not foment negativity and retribution
    - if they do, this feeds back into a negative feedback loop
  - we need collective ownership of these social hierarchies -- YES,
    duh -- but we do not need this negativity

### (Dynamics Specific to Types of Social Hierarchies)

- typical structural changes to sociohierarchical territory
  - if society is an "organism" like these hypnosis-trigger-happy
    social engineering socionauts claim, then what happens?
    - your healthy social organism starts to lose weight like a chemo
      patient or heroin junkie
    - finally, most (not all!) social structures shrivel up and only
      parts of the organism with vitality are like a skeleton -- or
      perhaps a raw nervous system -- compared to the original
      organism.
  - if these socionauts understood what they were doing, *they might
    know this*, but they don't -- or do they?

#### Antifragile Process Design in National Security

It appears that some American national security and homeland security
processes have been heavily influenced by antifragile design. This is
far and beyond a good thing. However, these caveats herein must be
taken into account. Agents and assets gain more influence over the
system by being expedient and obedient. They are rewarded with more
trust, more information and more opportunities -- this is to be
expected in any organization and especially covert organizations.
However, since questioning your superiors requires sending signals,
which can reveal information, so this means asking questions adds
risk. It appears this may be discouraged or even punished. When
constantly operating on less information, mistakes can be made that
these people may regret.

*Accountability* and *principles-first process structure* is and
always should be a must. If incentivization structures break down and
society's principles are not placed on a pedestal, then at a point
where sociohierarchical territory will begin quickly vanishing via
automation, this leaves good people at the mercy of narcissists and
sociopaths who have no rules but all the power.

Principles have always been highly prized in these organizations and
in most positions of responsibility. Thank God, let us keep it that
way, especially now, when more than anything the notion of
[magnanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics#Magnanimity_or_.22greatness_of_soul.22)
and other Aristotelian virtues should incentivize our people. Those
with exemplary behavior should gravitation towards influential roles
in social hierarchies. Such facets,
[I have discussed at length](/posts/2016-05-12-facets-of-greatness-intro.html#aristotelian-ethics-a-brief-interlude). A
society that does not recognize or reward virtue will soon have a
baseless foundation. It takes one generation.

### Answers to the Red Tide Effect

- discussing the problems without solutions does not help anyone.
  - we need the people to become aware to balance out instability
    through bottom-up social empowerment

- but also, more advanced research into social engineering processes
  and design would be very helpful
  - but when all of these process are conducted in total secrecy, it
    helps no one and only exacerbates tail risk

- i am talking about this because most people do not have this
  understanding. i have certainly never heard anyone methodically
  describe these impending systemic sociohierarchical changes and
  their accompanying economic & sociopolitical dynamics.
  - i am also concerned because if humanity is not on the same page,
    then -- up front -- it seems to allow the powerful to "control"
    the system, its dynamics, and any conflict that emerges
    - this is how the powerful will approach the situation
    - however, if conflict becomes catastrophe, then this will
      establish a traumatic neodeluvian archetype that will foment a
      new dark age, where it is impossible for virtuous behavior to
      flourish

  - the powerful always seek to retain advantage at all costs at all
    times: they won't see this. they operate with that assumption
    conditioned into every action:
    - every omission or distortion of truth
    - every political maneuver
    - every use of tactical deflection via delegation through 2
      degrees of social connections to void potential causal inference
      by adversaries
  - this is no longer the "correct" way to operate, if we are to save
    humanity. we need to cooperate. we need to live, breath, eat,
    sleep in the light, instead of artificial generation of darkness
    for a 24/7 blanket cover of night
  - at the same time, this does not mean we need to cede all of our
    advantages. this should be a gradual process, but the end-goal --
    the avoidance of that neo-deluvian archetype -- needs to be
    everpresent in everyone's minds.
    - i do not want to live in a world that does not reward virtue,
      where chaos, pollution and ruin prevent anyone from living with
      exemplary values

# (Why Must We Have An Understanding of Social Physics)

- this understanding of the radical differences b/w pre and
  post-Singularity world implies we must all understand social
  physics.
  - while social physics might be the knowledge which the wealthy, the
    elite and the shadowy "powers that be" have used to determine the
    course of human civilization, etc, etc.
    - the world will be transformed at a fundamental level and for
      *anyone* to function in it, the common person must be permitted
      to build upon an understanding of basic social physics

- otherwise, one of three unacceptable things will happen:
  - (1) reminiscent of the burning of the Library of Alexandria, the
    currently powerful will torch the current regime of history &
    information, leaving the the common person buried alive in some
    false paradigm.
    - "the illuminati" from a sense of responsibility from a partial
      understanding of social physics decide to "collapse the system"
      to retain control, either passively or actively
      - i don't believe in a single organization like this, but there
        are shadowy conspiratorial forces that have prefered to
        artificially destabalize some regions in order to shift
        influence and financial resources elsewhere
    - here, the destabalization results from artificial attempts for a
      fragment of the population to attempt to retain control

  - (2) attempts to control information, thought, and especially
    dissent result in a totally false belief system enforced via
    disinformation and neurological mind control
    - this results in a total loss of individuality and the total
      stagnation of evolutionary mechanisms which make humanity
      stronger as a whole
    - this mind control & etc does not geographically roll out on a
      global scale simultaneously, leading to destabilization from
      (...) and the aforementioned effects on individuality &
      evolutionary mechanisms
      - this, other factors (like the international response to these
        old and new mind control techniques) leads to destabalization.

  - (3) runaway chaos results from a lack of understanding of this new
    sociophysical paradigm almost dominated by information made
    manifest.
    - old modes of thinking dominate. classical war, greed,
      corruption, etc prevail. The world destabilizes and what are
      essentially the seven deadly sins lead to escalation of
      conflict.
    - here, the destabilization results from misunderstanding,
      distrust, lack of cooperation, informational problems, and
      traditional human fallability
      - above all, it's the desire to dominate this new world of
        information that leads to the incentivization of conflict
    - if this plays out, we may find ourselves trapped in a desolated
      world, completely unable to respond to overpopulation concerns,
      where the average person is so horribly fucked up by an
      archetype of deluvian scale, caused by merciless, ignorant human
      malice
      - the absolute worst part of such a world is that, YOU CANNOT
        SURVIVE AS A VIRTUOUS PERSON.
        - from there on out, the horrible neodeluvian archetype
          produces a dark age of chaos, hatred and malice

  - common themes of these scenarios
    - the common person is trapped within a world they don't
      understand, where there are no limitations on what is right,
      what is wrong, what can be made abject reality
    - if we ever incentivized cooperation, promoted a shared
      understanding of the world, and unleashed the human potential,
      more of us would have been able to individually channel more of
      our energy
      - if nothing else, then post-disaster, there wouldn't be an
        archetypical sentiment that we were lied to, deceived and
        totally fucked by the rich OR the powerful -- truly they are
        one and the same, financial influence is like abstract,
        commoditized social influence.


- (probably won't publish this)
- SO HOLY !@#$ I KNOW WHY I AM TRYING TO *UNITE* PEOPLE.
  - i know what happens. i know how people work. i know the systems
    they use. I can describe these systems and phenomena in greater
    detail than anyone I know, personally
    - if i had read more works of philosophy, i would probably see
      what I have written throughout it.
    - however, my work is more dense than anything i've ever read or
      been allowed to be exposed to -- and *because* of that and
      *because* it deals with power, semiotics and the architecture of
      belief systems that people claim it is dangerous.
      - i believe it is more dangerous for people to *NOT* understand
        this.
      - i'm looking 2, 5, 10, 50, 1000 years ahead.
        - i don't give a fuck about money
        - i don't give a fuck about fame
        - i don't give a fuck about comfort
        - i don't give a fuck about the next quarter's earnings
        - i don't give a fuck about winning an election
        - i don't give a fuck about offending someone (insofar as it
          doesn't affect my ability to save humanity)
          - however, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO RECEIVE SOCIAL SIGNALS BECAUSE
            I AM *DISCONNECTED*, so how the fuck would I know anyway.
      - i'm sorry, but i do not have faith that quells my frustration
        and anxiety over human fallibility. i know how groups respond
        to each other. i know what my value to society is
      - i am being told that i belong in a fucking sociophysical cage
        - i am being constantly reminded that everything i know that
          is wrong that other people don't see *isn't being addressed*
    - i am encouraged by some of the changes i've seen ... or at
      least, i was. now i know what is happening. and the country i
      love is being driven apart
      - by lies, by deceipt, for need of political expedience
      - i don't want to cast judgement on the left, the right,
        whatever. i just want to see people work together. until i see
        enemies huggin it out and actually practicing what they preach
        (love, God, whatever it is), then i am going to continue to be
        concerned.
      - what is your intent? is it to bring people together? or is
        your understanding of your intentions driven more by
        irrational fear than by a desire for unity?
    - i do not fear the human potential, but i do fear human
      fallibility, especially in the face of technonihilism
