- TODO: some of these ideas i've already incorporated into blogs


# Blog Ideas:


## IRL applications of social physics

- civic planning
- sociophysical minimization of traffic congestion for urban centers
  - for example, via suggested variation in working hours. tax
    deductions for the businesses that comply with slightly variated
    business hours
    - this specific idea for traffic minimization is perfect for major
      urban centers with huge problems w/ traffic
  - other ideas include traffic routing patterns, so that traffic is
    coaxed into into "perferated" bundles of cars that are like
    traffic packets, that can be routed more efficiently.
    - i originally had this idea in 2008. by modulating traffic light
      green/red time length, you coax certain quanta/waves of traffic
      to become clumped together, ideally minimizing the travel time
      and feul consumption time of everyone on the road.
      - very difficult to prove the application of this technique
        would be effective though. and, since it's augmented by
        hooking into Google/Waze/Uber/etc navigation and destinations,
        there might be some privacy concerns

## The Basics & Why It's Personally Relevant

- particle physics crossed with graph theory
  - with biophysics-like state-machines, with idealized particles and
    less-complex physical state
- social physics is like a (macrocosm) of biophysics




## Discussion of Schematic Complexity

- complexity of information crossed with type theory
- social physics simulations are rooted in particle physics w/ shared
  fields
  - the interactions in the physical space are dependent on n-D
    primary virtual space(s)
    - as well as combinatorially enumerated secondary virtual spaces
      which emerge
  - these virtual spaces can be parameterized with continuous or
    discrete variables
    - from which all the classic types of topological spaces emerge
- on the other end, the physical spaces (the "real" spaces) can
  provide for various particle behaviors and behavior types -
- this is the most complex intersection of infinities in every way I
  can conceive -
- it's the most complext application of applied pure math that I have
  yet imagined
  - but social physics is all mostly based on work done in the 19th
    century
- and yet, we all navigate this mathematically intractible maze with
  the same 3-pound slab of smart-meat
  - some of us are profoundly terrible at it.
  - a few operate methodically, including both sociopaths and empaths,
    balancing opportunity cost to empower themselves or others
  - Most of us meerkats are as adept as our range and sum of
    experience. This category operates socially without significant
    conscious effort, which implies several:
    - (1) They have one to five prior years of constant/regular social
      experience with few total or involuntary interruptions,
      regardless of whether it's positive or negative
    - (2) They have a wide variety of types of experiences
    - (3) They have a strong degree of choice in social experience,
      which requires and produces social independence
    - (4) They haven't been unhappy in their lives long enough to wonder
      why they can't get it together.
    - (5) When they have the kinds of problems almost everyone does,
      they have enough of the right social capital or psychological
      flexibility to adjust before they become socially isolated or
      financially disabled.

#### Social (behaviors/tactics to act/respond) are accumalated through conditioning

- most of us lack a rigid framework: we subconsciously operate
  emotionally-driven and neurally-connected statistical models
    - basically cross graph theory, markov models & state machines
    - behavior and state-changes driven by:
      - (1) rules whose rigidity ranges from diamond to steel to paper
      or plastic.
      - (2) information, confidence of information, distribution of
        information
      - (3) individual and collective objectives, needs, wants,
        resources and options


### Distribution of Agency & Will (Animus)

- the dynamics of physical/informational interactions of agents/nodes
  in graphs: social/physical/financial/etc
  - lots more to explore here

### Social Media


# Dr Strange

### Power and Mitigating Counter-Ancipitory Effects in One's Environment

- Dr Strange has a high focus on and a high density of
  counter-anticipitory effects
  - this is true, visually, semantically and in-terms
  - it's almost a story where, in terms of plot, time itself is
    rearranging itself, even though the movie is perceived linearly

> Beyond Time, Beyond Death...

where there are aspects of the metaphysical that transcend time and a
living agent's capacity to project change into the metaphysical beyond
their own subjective demise is perhaps the greatest power.
