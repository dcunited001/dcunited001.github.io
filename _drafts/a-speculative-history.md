### part 3 starts here

ideas for part 3:

- previous periods weren't stable enough such that architecture,
  construction or differentiation/specialization of roles would matter
  enough to reinforce those habits. at least not for long periods of
  time.
- integrate ideas that, before architecture, humans had very little
  idea of permanence. there was simply:
  - the stars, which seemed to be all but permanent & unchanging
  - the earth & geological formations, which were mostly permanent
  - human/animal life, which was, in stark contrast, very transient
- after architecture, humanity gained the ability to craft their own
  artifacts which varied in degree of permanence.
  - settlements contained buildings which, if properly constructed,
    seemed to last longer.
    - these artifacts themselves
- discuss how this led to the idea that permanence was special
  - the things that lasted longer seemed "better" because it was more
    difficult to properly design/engineer/construct things to last
    longer
    - this began to become applied to non-material things as well
  - people likely decided to take this concept to its extreme
    - could something be constructed which would be most permanent?
      - or at least, the idea would be to construct something which
        would at least be unquestionably permanent

writing in dilmun?  probably not
- dilmun was partially submerged by 8000 BC and mostly submerged by 6000 BC.
  - because of writing's viral nature, it would have quickly escaped
    if it was developed in Dilmun
  - we don't really see evidence of this in record or in the evolution
    of language
    - perhaps this is the missing piece though.
- there's a 4000 year space between the time when Dilmun would have been in it's heyday
  - and when Sumeria first started developing it's writing

writing in Sumeria (4000 BC)
- we only have proof of writing back to 4000 BC in Sumeria.
  - however, the first samples of writing are almost entirely
    comprised of financial records of transactions
    - and inventories of agricultural products.
- but IMO, there was writing in the area before people thought to
  produce clay tablets.
  - it was part of developing further abstract ideas, but we only have
    evidence of it from when people decided to start firing clay
    tablets.
  - speaking of which, that whole process seems cumbersome.
    - i don't think everyone had a kiln or means of creating these
      tablets.
    - they must have been required for some purpose
      - or at least strongly encouraged by some part of their culture
      - perhaps by the introduction of taxes
    - but if not everyone had a kiln, the inhabitants likely developed
      processes
      - for producing these in some systematic, more efficient way.
    - if you don't own a kiln, but you happen to be rich enough to
      need to tabulate inventory
      - or record a transaction, the it's basically like going to
        kinko's every time you need to print something
- these systems likely originated in a similar fashion to language.
  - and it's related to the humans abstracting concepts using art
  - the more common that became, the more people would communicate
    with art
  - as they communicated with art, particular symbols and styles would
    emerge to represent similar ideas
- however, they wouldn't be writing in a way that left a permanent
  trace,
  - that is, until the sumerians started keeping financial records.

(possibly another post)

- to prevent a fermi's paradox extinction event, there's a few
  questions that a intelligent species should/must always consider, at
  least until they pass several critical filters (this could be an
  entire separate article)
- this means that these should remain questions that are mostly
    unanswerable or require faith to deduce. two of these include:
  - (1) They must always search for their origins.
    - Each generation must re-evaluate what it knows and question
      its origins until this is solveable. Or at least this is very
        helpful in that each generation must re-evaluate it's own
        origins with accumulated knowledge
    - whoever controls the past controls the future.
      - by constantly rediscovering more about their past, they will
        have the opportunity to re-evaluate their own origins and,
        thus, the meaning of their origins.
      - imagine this wasn't so fairly straightforward early on and
        that man was trapped on the coasts of australia until they
        seized on freedom with navigational & seafaring tech. they
        wouldn't constantly question their origins or be able to
        adjust that.
      - i believe it's incredibly useful to adjust that lense used
        to understand the significance of your own culture(s) by
  - (2) They must not know whether they are alone in the universe.
  - other things that should remain unanswered or things that
    generally help an intelligent species avoid a great filter in
       Fermi's Paradox
  - they can't answer what the meaning of life is
    - they can't conclusively whether there is a God (akin but not
        equivalent to being able to answer whether there is life)
    - they can't inhabit the entire planet until they are ready
    - they can't develop specific technologies until they are ready
    - they all develop [mostly] at the same time. or iteratively
    - they all regard each other as equals
    - there isn't one dominant "race" or superpower that subjagates
      the others.

post-it (digitized on 8/8)

(need to restructure all of this)

After ascertaining the cause/nature of recurrent catastropic floods,
ancient people sought a safe haven.
- some realized that deglaciation was causing it, so they needed
  to understand geography and to be able to communicate on a wide
  scale
- those that realized that deglaciation was causing it.
  - they would have wanted to inhabit areas close to rivers that were
    higher elevation and risky for total destruction in a major flood.
    - they also would want to inhabit areas close to glaciers to
      monitor for impending floods and close to
  - A few realized that the amount of ice was finite and thus, this
    transition period of flooding was limited.
    - (some of this should be moved)
    - they were also familiar with the nature of myth and information
      and understood that they could control how people thought about
      massive floods long after they stopped.
    - they knew that thousands of years after the flooding stopped
      people would forget about it totally (this was before the
      persistence of most knowledge beyond 3 generations)
      - but they knew they pain of near-total civilizational
        destruction should never be forgotten
- at the same time, of those who realized a safer more stable world
  would arrive, there were those who were disgusted by their own
  sinful nature. they wanted man to forget their history to give us a
  clean start.
  - they also knew how important it was to always search for your
    beginnings.
- so a few wise men thought:
  - we can find a peaceful land by the rising sea, away from the river
    flooding powered by steady deglaciation. Others amoung us can live
    close to the glaciers, but out of the flood zones. They can keep
    an eye out for melting or a break in the levee
- but the wisest amoung them knew all traces of our lowly seaside
  civilization will mostly disappear, as will traces of most
  settlements in some areas. this might ease mankind's memory of
  perhaps their most disgraceful days. And they will forever search
  for their origin and identity. They might be blessed by their
  amnesia.

### 8,000 BC - 5,000 BC

(from the end of the neolithic to the beginning of the copper age)

sahara climate change
- from 8000 BC to 5000 BC

4 areas with flooding disaster
- doggerland
- black sea
- persian gulf
- ??

break pre-history up into several periods:

- 8,000 BC
  - settlements in turkey (cayal hatuk)
  - melting glaciers providing an impetus for sea travel
  - ending with settlements in mesopotamia
- 5,000 BC

archetypes:
- sunken continent, lost civilization
- deluge/flood/disaster & vengeful god

black sea settlements? research
- apparently a glacial deluge here?  it's a hypothesis, but i think a reasonable one

Copper Age
- anatolia
- cultures began to be capable of processing copper
  - bronze requires copper & tin
  - tin was scarce originally? why?
- vinca culture (early: 5700 BC - 4800 BC, late: 4800 BC - 4200 BC)
  - tartaria tablets (containing vinca symbols),
- timna valley, in southern isreal, shows evidence of copper mining dating back to between 7,000 BC to 5,000 BC
- Bhirrana, the oldest ICV site (dating back to 7500-6200 BC)

Bronze Age
- Troy I founded in 3,000 BC

- sunken monolith discovered at ~50m near sicily in August 2015
  - how much work is being done to explore sites like this?
  - is it possible to do something like LIDAR for underwater surveys
    - that are under less than 100m seawater?
- dilmun, a lost civilization located near Bahrain and mentioned in Gilgamesh
- we can see the cultural legacy of sumerian cuneiform in other mesotopian languages
  - but why is it that the harrapan language just disappeared without any real cultural legacy,
    - especially with their language?

recent genetic work have shown that
- a "mixture" of Indo-Aryans and Dravidians began circa 2200 B.C. and ended around 100 A.D
- recent ars technica article?


### 5,000 BC

by this time, civilization was well established in parts of the indus valley
- it likely wasn't anything like the technologically advanced ICV around 3000 BC

"the plan"
- collective unconscious strikes again
- development of systematized means of accelerating the development of culture
  - by identifying the conditions that allow society to study and develop knowledge
    - stability, tradition, virtues, ...
    - a healthy economy
  - then identifying a geographically shielded location close to the center of the world
- establishment of systems of self-preservation for this culture
  - no one leaves, unless authorizes

## Part 3


preface the article by defining how this is 'speculative history'
- state that it couldn't be true
  - for the same reason that batman couldn't hang out with the xmen
  - save for part 3

### 4,000 BC

development of the plan

### 3,000 BC

back to harappa
- proto-anthropology
  -


In fact, a recently discovered
[underwater site in Florida](http://phys.org/news/2016-05-evidence-humans-southeastern-earlier-previously.html)
shows that pre-Clovis peoples certainly inhabited the Americas more
than 14,500 years ago. This begs the question: did people of that time
have access to seafaring technology?

### 2,000 BC

paradise lost

previous disasters:
- cro magnon? neanderthal?

topics to mention:
- sicilian monolith
- bathymetry maps
  - how much of this should i cover?
- evolution of langauge through proto-anthropologists
- the indended purpose behind development of mythology
  - epic of gilgamesh (city vs country, city wins?)
- harrapans didn't seem to have war or much conflict at all

topics to research:
- extent & time period of sumerian civilization
  - established written law code around 1,800BC w/ hammurabi
- order of events in the bible
- epic of gilgamesh (plot, themes, timeline and inspiration from the early world)
- relationship b/w sumeria and harrapans
  - trading with sumerians as early as 3,500BC (from crash course
    video)

the harrapan culture that created "the plan":
- a segment of harrapan culture in the himalayan steppes
  - close to the mouth of the indus river
  - a civilization that witnessed many of their neighbors' societies
    perish in floods, leaving no trace
- this society become wise enough to understand the cause of the
  floods.  they knew that the causes behind them would not last
  forever
  - they identified a location that would provide water and sustenance
    but was mostly guarded from flooding damage
    - they intentionally picked a place that was high in the mountains
      because it would be nearly impossible to invade.
    - thus, their culture and the cultures they studied and protected
      would be shielded from the chaos of warfare
  - from here, they developed a plan to prevent such widespread loss
    of culture. to them, nothing was more tragic than the
    disappearance of culture.  nothing, except the subversion of it.
    - was their choice to disappear a response to subversion by
      conquerors?
    - or was it because they were afraid that knowledge of their
      society would lead back to knowledge they were trying to protect
      the world against? i.e. leading humanity to a premature
      discovery of 'the plan' or of forbidden maths.
  . also, from here, high up in the world, they observed cultures rise
      and fall, languages grew and subsided while their culture
      persisted
  - they also understood the curse of overpopulation and, by learning
    the highest of maths, they understood the inevitable progression
    of technology into artificial intelligence.
    - this insight was accessible since well before the first
      mechanical computers.  all that is necessary is the knowledge
      that it is possible for a machine or even a system to be created
      in the image of man's mind.
    - from their wisdom, knowing this and knowing the heart of man,
      they determined that the development of such an artificial mind
      could lead to utopia or to the destruction of mankind
- and to protect against overpopulation, they determined that
  disasters early in man's history would be more effective in staving
  off the dangers of overpopulation
  - should i continue describing this aspect of overpopulation?  it's
    pretty fucking grim. nothing good would come of people knowing the
    truth
- anyways, the development of a plan to ensure the survival of mankind
  began. it became known to them ....
  - they developed protocols to be preserved unconsciously through
    mythology
    - protocols for propagating information back to 'the origin,'
      though the origin was hardly intended to be a physical place


development of hidden maths throughout history

- I don't have much evidence to back up my claims here, but
  it'd be very interesting to examine the prevelence of
  mathematic knowledge throughout the world.
- Particularly, it'd be interesting to study in context with
  both the transmission of ideas through the active cultural
  relationships and the dependency graph for various
  mathematics.
- That is, since throughout history it's been advantageous to
  restrict the propagation of *some* mathematics, and thus,
  the extent of this knowledge is often lost to history.
- But we may be able to learn more about what these cultures knew --
  *paleo-epistemology*, lulz -- by making some inferences into the
  nature of mathematics and inferring how their models and notation
  systems would restrict their thought and progress in some areas of
  math.

    groups based on anaotmical linquistic properties

harrapan technology:

- some homes were connected to a centralized drainage system that used
  gravity to carry waste
- in mahenjo-daro, the largest building was a bathhouse
- they traded cotton cloth
- their way of life was dependent on a consistent flooding cycle
  (twice per year)
  - does this result from flooding from glaciation?
  - would they have been able to observe and predict a change in water
    flow from a melting glacier?
- did harrapans know about and observe climate change?

- personal beliefs on the transmission of culture throughout the world
  around 3,000 B.C.
  - that mostly lack evidence by the way
  - harappan civilization was created in the ancient world after the
    'center' of the ancient world was identified
    - over the course of 1,000 years (starting ~4,000 B.C.) --
      timeline is not too important here
      - after the cataclysm wiped out most of seaside human
        civilization
      - after the archetype of cataclysm wiping out human civilization
        was fresh in our minds
        - therefore we would have been determined to ensure it would
          not happen again
    - it is possible for humantity to unconsciously cooperate, even
      with limited communication
    - we would have spread culture and myth to 'advertise' this place
      - where great thinkers would go to develop technology
      - this could have occured through the development of myth over
        the course of 1,000-1,500 years
    - the 'center' of the world would have needed to be mostly known
      by this point
      - people understanding tradecraft would have understood that the
        'center' of the world
        - would offer the most opportunity,
          - as that would have the greatest amount of aggregate human
            dispersion
        - this is only understandable after developing moderate maths
          - but still before developing widespread written language
            - there's a difference between written language and
              written communication
    - the most powerful information to have at this time would be
      geographic information
      - and accurate geographic information.
      - elements of mythology from this time should reflect this.
      - where are the most valuable resources?
        - how can we be sure? how many people know?
        - where does the land end?  does it ever?
        - how do we know where we are? how do we know where we should
          go? (the stars)
        - if the center is where the power is, how do we know where
          the center is?
    - and because multiple civilizations would be able to develop an
      understanding of:
      - (1) the center of the world being the most powerful and
        offering the most opportunity
      - (2) as well as the estimated direction towards the center
      - then with these two ideas these precivilizations could push
        emmisaries towards the center of the world
          - by moving with the gradient of average physical
            temperature -- without needing to know the spherical shape
            of the world -- which would naturally happen anyways
        - first, to establish communication networks with the rest of
          the world
        - second to accelerate the development of technology and
          culture
      - and most importantly, the more advanced minor precivilizations
        would do this unconsciously
        - and if they were wise enough to anticipate other culture's
          understanding of these ideas
          - they could do so with anticipation that others would be
            there to meet them in the center!
          - again, WITH NO COMMUNICATION.  it's purly
            unconscious. based solely on metaphysics and wisdom.
  - so i believe this was the plan, spontaneously developed across the
    world after the pain of the cataclysm(s)
    - after people had experienced the sum of antiquity
      - and the aggregate developments of their ancestry just simply
        vanish into nothingness
    - i believe this is what cultivated the desire of ancient
      civilizations
      -  to want to 'leave their mark' with monolithic archetecture
    - they had experienced the pain of losing everything
      - that pain transmuted itself into a universal archetype
    - and so, they pushed to find a way to ensure that it never
      happened again
      - while simultaneously understanding the problem of exponential
        growth and overpopulation
      - overpopulation (experienced as hunger & natural resource
        constraints) and the cataclysm are two primative archetypes
        - from the dawn of humanity at the end of the ice age
        - these factor into our actions at a collective unconscious
          level
  - and so "the plan" was to develop human culture and technology to
    limit the suffering of the world
    - to limit the global trauma of overpopulation, while ensuring
      survival in the face of the next catastrophe
  - and so there are many cultural tools and treasures developed
    during the harappan civilization at the time
    - the civilization had plumbing and other amazing technologies.
      basically the equivalent of rome
      - i wonder whether this civilization was planned in a region
        they knew would run out of water eventually
    - i believe that they vigorously studied linguistics that the
      time.
      - linguistics would have been fascinating.
      - to develop culture tools to ensure humanitys survival, they
        would have found linguistics invaluable.
      - they would have assessed the properties, pros and cons of
        various linguistic forms (SVO/SOV/VSO/etc)
    - and i believe it is here that we find the mystery of babel (and
      the mystery of the proto-indo-european)
      - all the world developed a universal language here.  it would
        have been invaluable to do so
        - therefore, all the languages began to come together into one
      - however, this unity invites advantage in developing discord.
        - accents and microdialects are developed in cities today
          - with the purpose of creating a system of communication
            that is difficult for others to understand
        - therefore, the unity of a universal language, invites the
          development of competing languages
      - so, one language was created, then other competing languages
        were subversively cultivated
        - here, you have would typically have many languages created
          at first,
        - then one of those languages would become superior and would
          become the prime competing language
    - this unified langauge wouldn't immediately be transmitted to the
      rest of the world of course,
      - but as the prime source of culture that impregnated the world,
        it's effect would be adumbrating
  - evidence of these lingual developments can be found in sanskrit
    - sankrit as a written language was specifically developed to
      capture nearly every possible human sound
      - there are 7 different vowels and 2 variations of each for a
        total of fourteen
      - the language elegantly handles digraphs/trigraphs and
        universally captures all of those sounds
    - i believe that the original harappan language may have vanished
      because of this
      - (and this is mostly my prime basis for all these beliefs, which
        are mostly extensions of this)
    - the harappans studied language more than anything else and
      developed this perfect universal language
      - captured in sanskrit. which could be used to capture and study
        other languages
      - to facilitate the development of an omniphonetic language
  - however, out of the study of language in this civilization,
    - i believe another thing happened that would be missed by most
    - and this is that the particular advantages/disadvantages and the
      facets of each lingual structure
      - would have been vigorously studied by the intelligentsia of
        the time.  (making them more intelligent)
      - these people would have been incredibly wise.
    - and i believe they crafted a plan to resolve a debate on
      language/culture
      - and to provide humanity with cultural tools to recombine
        thousands of years later
        - that altogether these cultural tools would be far more
          powerful than any one would be alone
        - but that if any one of these were to absolutely rule over
          the others before we were ready
        - their descendents would end up creating a terrible
          homogenous world
      - and so they seeded regions of the earth with various forms of
        language and culture,
        - isolating them from having too much influence on each other
        - but still allowing adjacent cultures to merge and mix and
          combinate
      - they would have needed to know the extent of geography very
        well.
        - at least knowing the old world very, very well (and likely
          of the existance of the new world)
        - this would be greatly facilitated by the cultural apparatus
          that created harappa in the first place
          - as well as by the trade and commerce that helped it push
            forward
      - they would have picked the most basic, most primal elements of
        language and culture
        - they would have known that if they succeeded in rolling this
          plan out
          - that competition would keep civilizations in contained and
            none would gain too much superiority
      - i think they may have also decided to make their civilization
        vanish,
        - although i can't quite decide on why that is
  - this protocivilization would have also understood the problems of
    agriculture and resource limitations
    - and once the harappan civilization was doomed (by earthquake or
      whatever)
      - they would have been motivated to develop some kind of plan to
        avoid catastrophe

and this is where the story for the wise arch-mage came from
- (definitely mythos at this point....)
- who was born in an ancient, but doomed world
- and who divided a great magic into 7 forms to be spread to the
  corners of the earth
  - to be hidden in plain view until the world was ready
  - and until the world had a great need to unite these magic forms
    into one
  - which he knew would occur at the same time, the most critical time
    for our development

# New World Development

### Myth of Quetzecotl

- did the aztec and maya have myth predicting the return/arrival of europeans

### Diffusion of Eastern Information from the West (c. 1200-1500)

- what effect did the East's travels to the new world have on the
  projection of information and myth from the west?
  - japan & china arrived on the west coast(s)
    - but where? when? did they return to the East?
  - the best way for a small group of people to affect the Americans
    at that time would have been influence on myth/philosophy/etc
- did any Buddhists arrive? if so, did they plan on returning to the
  East?

### Settler's Mill

- so you're telling me: this gold stayed at the surface of a creekbed
  for 5000+ years. gold is in the mountains, primarily, not the bed of
  rivers & creeks (sometimes -- it's conceivable)
  - rivers and creeks always flow through depressions in elevation:
    valleys, etc.
  - what tech did American natives in this valley have? did they use
    copper? at some time, they must have.
  - if natives in this region, around 1700 & 1800 *knew* about
    Colonial & US expansion westward and also *knew* about their lust
    for gold, wouldn't they have tried to protect this gold or take
    it?
  - i really just don't know enough about this story or the history to
    know.

- however, rivers/creeks are always good hunting grounds. the
  water brings animals like flies to honey.
  - a multi party approach to hunting: one or more parties sit at
    higher elevations. other parties are at lower elevations.
  - animals coming to drink at a stream, which is always on a gradient
    of elevation change (the stream moves downhill) and is usually at
    the middle of some depression in elevation.
    - so tactics arise where one party can chase animals uphill and
      they are usually in vulnerable positions near water.
  - because you're using multi-party tactics, if some parties are in
    higher elevations, then they can spot game and try to signal to
    the other parties in extremely basic ways
    - perhaps using smoke signals, but that's more complicated
      signaling than is needed or probably would be used to hunt.
  - *the point is, if you want to eat, you're going to be around these
    streams all the time and find tons of gold that the Europeans
    want.*
    - any culture that used copper would love gold.
    - why was there a place like this where the europeans settled it
      very quickly (within 50-100 years), but then it was untouched
      for the rest of the time.
  - this tendancy to center hunting parties around areas with
    streams/etc demonstrates the power of the collective
    unconsciousness on human behavior. we also need water to survive,
    which pulled us to water sources.
  - a small stream in the right place is practically an ancient burger
    king. some streams are more connected than others. physical areas
    that are mountainous have local regions that are more disconnected.
    - this affects how animals and people travel and where they are
      likely to be by constraining their likely paths from one
      lowland/depression to another. picture a graph where nodes are
      connected by lower elevation areas and disconnected by areas
      with steep elevation gradients.
      - to enter some areas, you can only proceed through tight
        mountain passes. if every entrance to an area like this is
        tight, then the large animal population inside is more or less
        constrained by population growth and is less determined by
        migratory patterns.
    - however, the lowest elevation areas are vulnerable because
      predators need to drink too. staying in high elevation areas
      means you can run downhill fast.

### Did Vikings Bring Middle Eastern Gold to America?

- there's so much speculation in this section, it's not funny

- did the vikings bring gold over from the crusades? the crusades
  occured mostly after their north american exploration (the second
  crusade was around 1102)
  - they would have to establish many missions to/from the new world
    to get the gold there safely.

- there was supposedly something taken from Al Aqsa when/after it was
  captured in the First Crusade in 1099. it was buried beneath Al Aqsa
  and some people think it was gold. (some serious speculation here)
  - this would be an ideal place to bury gold to back a currency
  - if you're holy site was captured, you could pretty much assume
    that you're screwed. Al Aqsa, today the Dome on the Rock, was and
    is the third holiest site of Islam.
  - it is clear that the Knights Templar became involved in banking in
    the two centuries after the crusades, but they could have obtained
    the gold/other financial backing for that elsewhere in the middle
    east or simply by dominating trade in the middle east shortly
    after the crusades.

- however, if you did find a fuckton of gold in someone's sacred holy
  site, would you want to take it and use it? if you always worried
  about the geopolitical stability of Europe (i.e. 14th century
  explusion of Moors from spain, 15th(?) century push against Ottoman
  empire in Wallachia, etc) then wouldn't you want a secret stash, in
  case you lost everything?
  - if you took the gold and used it, Europe's weaker geoeconomic
    position means commerce brings it back towards the center of the
    world.
  - but if you were in contact with the Vikings during the crusades,
    you might hear about far off lands that Europe would be more
    likely to settle before Middle Easterners, who almost certainly
    wouldn't know it existed.
- if you could get the gold there and push it as far away as possible,
  you could ensure you always had a kickstart to European power,
  perhaps when you needed it most.
  - if you acted like you discovered this gold in a far off place, you
    wouldn't have to deal with the cultural consequences of having
    taken it.

- however, explaining how the gold (whereever it came from -- europe
  or the middle east) made it to Newfoundland or the New World: that's
  the easiest part.
  - explaining how the gold made it to the vikings is harder and then
    explaining how the Vikings would push this gold all the way west
    is the hardest part.
- i've done like zero research on this, but it would at least make for
  an interesting fantasy novel plot mechanic -- or perhaps a good
  History Channel special.
  - there's probably a million one-liners that would discredit this
    theory, but i have seen history channel specials on viking
    journeys through the new world, including a tower on the east
    coast (rhode island?) whose origin can't be explained.

### The Curse on King Tut's Tomb

- if bacteria can be trapped under antarctic ice for millinea,
  preserved in complete isolation with little to consume for energy
  but itself and hydrothermal energy
  - then... isn't it feasible for egyptians to have isolated some
    similar living systems they knew would perpetuate themselves until
    the tomb(s) were to be opened.
    - if so, then this knowledge of perpetuating living systems would
      probably improve over time.
      - so, anecdotes (preferably data) on infections when opening
        more recent tombs or certain groups of tombs might yield a few
        clues. although, at some points, the knowledge could have
        certainly been lost.
      - they wouldn't need microscopes or direct observations to
        understand how these systems would maintain themselves
        - ancient civilizations had a fundamentally different
          understanding of living systems
        - these civ's certainly had working knowledge of the
          introduction/transduction of physical energy into
          systems. otherwise, they would not nearly universally revere
          the Sun as a god.
          - the sun introduces energy to all physical
            systems. variance in daily/annual sunlight becomes
            variance in crop yield, etc.
            - crops exposed to more light-hours per day are bigger
            - crops on hilly terrain vary in the level of energy
              absorbed. if you work with agriculture/food/nature
              commonly, you see this stuff everywhere.
            - other factors produce variance as well, but none as
              profoundly as the sun
          - further still, for perennial plant material that burns
            well, those individual plants grown with maximal energy
            exposure have absorbed more energy. this understanding of
            how to achieve higher density of heat release is critical
            knowledge for early metallurgy (though usually applying to
            more than just perennial plants)
            - so, if the sun yields energy to renewable sources, then
              what gives unrenewable resources their energy?
        - anyways...
      - egyptians were obsessed with permanence and immortality. thus,
        fthey may have been fascinated by studying systems where
        "essence" or "essence of virulence" is perserved over
        years/decades/generations
        - they certainly experimented with preserving humans. they
          probably conducted other experiments as well.
    - however, to persist for thousands of years, the living systems
      would almost certainly need an external energy source (and some
      circulation of airflow)
      - external openings into the cursed tombs? some tombs have small
        spaces enabling airflow. for at least some time, this might
        enable some to add external animal energy sources into the
        tombs (pure conjecture lmao)
    - one of the most fascinating things to me is to think about how
      ancient societies may have solved problems that we can only
      perceive to have modern solutions.

#### [Stone Strucures in Saudi Arabia](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/archaeologists-are-mystified-by-ancient-gates-in-saudi-lava-fields/)

if you look at this topographical map, the structures to the east of
Khaybar all point in the direction of the gradient of elevation. if i
had a better topographical map, i would be more certain.

- [saudi topographical map](http://en-gb.topographic-map.com/places/Saudi-Arabia-2754080/)

it seems like these structures may have been used to collect stores of
rainwater during flash floods, where the water could be collected for
storage in the structures which are seen at higher elevations. it
seems counterintuitive because the triangular base of the features
expands outward as the elevation drops, but the water should flow
along the outside of the structures as well, forming vortices turning
inwards around the points where there are circular features. this
could balance out the water flow from the inside, pushing the water
level slightly higher around the well-like features.

in order to understand whether that is true, i need to see where these
structures are distributed in saudi arabia. if they're used for water
collection/storage, they probably lay along the shortest trade
roots. at first, this would allow settlements to be maintained away
from the more commonly traversed coastal regions. as more
infrastructure was build, it could help facilitate a trade network
that provides a secure shortcut across the desert. stored
water/supplies would only be dispensed to those friendly to the trade
network. building these structures gives you an economic advantage
before access to maritime trade routes.

with aqueducts, romans could position cities and forts in more
central, easily defended areas that depended on roman
infrastructure. similarly, these extended settlements and trade routes
would be more difficult for enemies to compromise. at the time when
these were initially built, anyone pushing too far into your territory
would likely run out of supplies. if any these ideas are on the right
track, then there should be more architectural evidence around the
smaller sites at higher elevations. specifically, pottery.

- also could be a game trap, though why are they all constructed
  pointing towards the increase in gradient?
  - for territorial advantage: to force the animal to run uphill, more
    slowly?
  - i think if it really were a game trap, these would be constructed
    in areas with higher traffick hunting.
    - do these correspond with heat maps of local wildlife movement
      patterns? yeh,
      [desert kite map](http://www.globalkites.fr/Interactive-Map)

- almost certainly used for hunting traps because of their
  distribution in jordan.
  - but the locations were probably chosen along gradient bc of
    territorial advantage, but also bc they coincidentally correspond
    to slightly more hydrated regions, thus more vegetation, thus,
    animals wander in...
    - people spot from the hills, people spring from the round-shaped
      formations in the long kites
    - driving them further up, pressuring from both flanks, wearing
      out the game, easily killed at the top
    - just like RINO hunting in America...

- how does this correlate to Dilmun
  - supposedly these arabian structures are up to 9000 y/o?
    - which ones are oldest and where?
    - what technologies were they found with?
      - clay pottery? protowriting?
  - if they are from ~6000-4000bc, this is after the time that the
    persian gulf had mostly filled in

- how do these structures correlate to north saharan civilizations?
  - age/distribution of pictographs
