- mostly junk

## Junkyard with Automated Salvage

- ...screws LOL
- absent fabrication tech, even simple parts like screws can sell for
  relatively high prices on Amazon, in quantity.
  - there isn't high demand for replacement parts, but the prices are
    easy to beat if you have large supply and cheap costs
  - there is literal gold in RAM chips, which are dead simple to
    harvest and worthless to individual consumers
    - ~500 chips per gram of gold
    - there is also value in scrap metal, en masse with smelting
  - if the tech is an open platform, it can easily be distributed
    - if building on top an open scrap/salvage platform, then platform
      gains traction and mindshare. then, the business model would be
      to provide the platform as a portible service.

- this platform should be broken up into pieces, some of which the
  government is more fit to solve (since they need to solve many of
  these problems anyways)
  - TL;DR; if this thing gets built, we have taught robots to scrap
    robots and build more robots ... from basically anything

#### Synergy

- there is potential synergy with:
  - maker movement
  - ifixit and self-repair movement
  - amazon
  - environmental movement
  - junkyards

#### Challenges

- the main drawback: it may not be worth dealing with the entropy
  - (both in terms of physical energy to process and the logistic
    complexity of processes required to absolve entropy of logically
    disordered potential products)

- need cofounders/investers who already have a stake in salvage/scrap,
  especially electronics. someone has already built this out in some
  way

- it requires scale for any returns/profits whatsoever
  - e.g. screw are cheap to fabricate & assortments are priced cheaply
    - demand is low, manufacturing costs are cheap at scale, products
      are small and their competitiveness is no subject to product
      improvement/change
      - but there's still room for lower offers to beat the price

- there are no real profitable "MVP" featuresets
  - the software/hardware is NOT easy

- absolutely requires social traction & adoption of an open platform
  for success. social awareness/support/enthusiasm/investment would be
  a critical dependency, without which an undesireable pivot or
  failure would be certain
  - the drawback to such an open platform is that it may lead to
    oversupply.
    - and there aren't large volumes of sales for many of these
      items. if the sales are associated with the brand/image of a
      single open platform, then low quality experiences would
      negatively impact the platform's viability (and early enough to
      be catastrophic to its image)
    - the allure of potential profit to entice early adopters &
      supporters of this platform is similar to *retail
      arbitrage*. there, one needs a high-demand item of cheap goods
      with 2.5x amazon price for profit, where the store's bargain
      price has limited supply. here, the limits on supply are lifted
      as the platform gains momentum.
  - the economics of scale here require either:
    - platform with moderate social investment (+1,000-10,000)
    - a fuckton of upfront investment (which is why some aspects of
      this are better suited for government)

- potential liability, if product quality can't be assured. offering
  guarantees may be expensive, but if so, brand/image would suffer,
  dealing more damage than payouts.

- cost of talent acquisition and employment roles are expensive
  - almost certainly requires like $10.0 million in first year

#### Employment Roles Needed

- robotics, software, web, data science, open platforms
- legal, marketing, more legal
- economics, industrial engineering, renewables engineering
- materials science, metallurgy, recycling
- operations (supply chains, logistics), transportation

#### The Problem & Product

- there's a lot of untapped value in junk/scrap which can't move
  because the markets here are too complex for buyers to find good and
  sellers to find buyers.
  - that is, the markets here suffer from a **matching problem**,
    where the logistics are so complex for buyers to find goods which
    would otherwise be available at attractive prices that they don't
    even bother.
  - thus, there are extreme bottlenecks on the rate of actual
    transactions. like a capacitor with extremely high capacitance,
    the complexity prevents liquidity from flowing.

- so basically, the product is a platform/service to solve the
  "matching problem" for junk/scrap.
  - there are businesses that solve these problems (for large
    appliances like washers/dryers/etc), but they're all specialized
    and a lot of economic potential goes to waste.
 - junk steel/metals can be turned into scrap & smelted. the returns
   are low, but the equipment required (and transit costs) are usually
   prohibitive.

#### Ingest publicly available support documents to mine for partlists

- it's starting point and shouldn't be that hard, especially if
  manufacturers provide the BOM's they used to source from their
  suppliers

#### Database of Consumer Products

- partial lists of parts with:
  - supply trends
  - demand/price on wholesale/retail (e.g. amazon)
  - processing/storage/transaction costs
    - cost in space/time to keep in warehouse
  - potential fluctuation in economics (in price/cost/supply)
  - expected lifetime/viability of parts

- categories of parts
  - electrical components
    - motors
    - antennae
  - mechanical components
    - screws
    - gears?
- preferential lists of parts

#### Platform Components

- computer vision to classify products, parts, and materials like
  scrap metals.
- open hardware & software specs/interface for the physical/virtual
  automation components
- database of products with up to date economic trends
- integration between data sources
  - amazon & retail price sources
  - supply/demand signals
  - junk supply databases
  - products/parts database
    - datamined manufacturer support docs
    - manufacturer BOM's to supply chains
    - hobbyist/activist contributions to the open platform
      - synergy w/ maker movement & enviromentalists is key

#### Integration with Junkyard Supply Databases

- if the tech can be built to function in shipping containers (even
  the smelting/etc), it's portable and can facilitate reuse of
  otherwise worthless space-wasting products ... that are literally
  hard to move.
- if you can centralize this data, then you have competitive advantage
  on analytics about the economics (supply/demand)

#### Computer Vision to classify parts & products (in various stages)

- can use both model numbers and stereoscopic image recognition
  - classify parts by codes
- can assess functionality of parts with CV to a reasonable degree
  - automated testing of parts (like motors) can provide a signal for
    ML algorithms to improve their classification/assessment of
    functionality

- can classify screws and other basic misc parts
  - either scrap or not, based on quality and economic factors
    (supply, demand & profit potential)

#### Organize Small/Large Parts

- similar to the hackerspace robots to sort screws
  - classify mechanical/electronic components ... and sort
  - prep for shipment to amazon (warehouse-as-a-service)

#### Automate Disassembly of Consumer Electronics

- robots (for each motor, > +1 new degrees of freedom lulz)

#### Resell Mechanical Parts on Amazon

### Revenue Streams

- Scrap
- Resale
- "Smelting-as-a-Service"
- raw materials for fabrication (advanced 3d printing, etc)
- Steel Futures (& other salvagable commodities)
- Insights for financial sector (consumer behavior)

### Exit Strategy

#### Cash Out By Selling to Amazon


## ML (X) A/V Lighting for Music

- tensor network for ML drumming styles applied to Ableton MIDI
  - the network that learns/recognizes/generates drumming styles or
    other instrument styles, what does it look like
- automate coordination for A/V (Lights, LED's etc)
  - but to inform/match the motions use the tensor network trained on
    the recognition of a musician's play styles for specific songs
  - needs to be able to analyze real-time audio to representations of
    musician/song/style/etc
  - the goal is to have a lighting show that runs itself, essentially
    - it recognizes the song that's being played and how many bars a
      solo/duet/etc is going on for.
    - it matches certain song regions or elements of play style to
      specific lighting transitions

## Blockchain X Medium (see blockchain notes)

## Backup/Analyze/Provide documentation for old electonics (& their components)

- app to backup/facilitate access to documentation for old appliance's
  electrical components & circuit diagrams
  - i'm sure there's already an app for that
  - this would be excellent with an app for recognizing gear with a
    3d/2d camera
    - it wouldn't just recognize the top-level product though, it
      could recognize the individual components and list the top-level
      VCR/DVD/etc product that the components were used in
  - an app like this would be most useful when paird with a community
    to foster reuse & recycling of antiquated gear
    - it would be useful to connect user's with suggested products to
      hack together with old VCR parts
      - kind of like suggested recipe's for individual ingredients
  - the challenge for this app would be building the community
    - it would be a bit of a challenge to break into the market
      because i'm sure there's already competition
    - so the challenge is to establish market share without running
      out of funding, so that all the appropriate pieces of the
      community can be built
- nanobrain-cloud to distributed timeshare service
  - essentially rent your brains computation power on demand (ok
    that's dumb lmao)

## Logical Diffing of Federal USC Statutes to Produce Functionally Equivalent Documentation of Law

- parse USC federal & state law sections as "trees" to rebase the
  language so that it's functionally equivalent, but more simply
  expressed
  - rebase as in github, where you make the series of commits more
    simple. so, each bill passed through congress is like a "commit"
    in a git project. and they reference and merge in changes by
    referencing the law sections like an addressing scheme
    - but this is really complicated.
    - so it'd be useful to have software that parses this stuff
      semantically, so that the laws can be more simply understood and
      loopholes can be more easily identified.
  - an app like this would be very useful for people that are
    writing bills
    - you could have continuous integration and "automated testing"
      for congressional assistants to aid in writing bills

## App: Train Stronger Rhyme Recognition/Generation via Neural Hack (semantic dissonance)

- present users with streams of non-sensical sentences that maintain a
  rhyme scheme. the statements don't make sense, but there is always a
  simple meter and a rhyme scheme.
  - the intention is that the semantic dissonance is jarring, which
    subconsciously compels the mind to focus a bit more on the rhymes
    it encounters
    - that is, it notices and picks up the intentional rhymes, but
      there is no valid semantic meaning of the sentence,
    - so it should force the mind to focus on the content its
      processing more, thus internalizing potential rhymes
  - ideally app would process voice allow for mutliple meters, but the
    content would be randomly generated

## Misc Tech Ideas

- AR Meta Flashbards
- UI idea: tilt-to-reveal interaction for GIF's shared online


## EEG Alarm Clock

- wakes you up in an ideal phase of sleep, before some specified time.
- allows you to collect data about your sleep patterns/etc

## Oscil8 simplification:

  - a pastie dev site for configuring synth patches and sharing w/
    short-url, text & data
  - would include WebAudio MIDI interface
    - potentially emulation hardware/VST
  - simply a free tool for playing w/ Software/Web VST's and sharing
    the sounds in JSON (probably already exists)

- security idea: connect to un/secured video streams where the
  location of cameras is known: only in public places. those small
  cities and towns with primarily regional social flux will always
  exhibit lower identity flux, esp. new identities
