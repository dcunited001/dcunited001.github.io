# Part: Two

can transition from talking about tissue networks
- viewing tissue networks at various levels of scale
- behaviour determined by electrical fields
  - by a genomic, biochemical homonculus
  - a homonculus is your mental representation of your body,
    - with respect to various other mental faculties, like tactile
      sense, motion or prioperception
  - but there should be a genomic, biochemical homunculus which
    chemically drives the development of the nerves which drive
    electric impulses that determine tissue behaviors
    - that is, there should be some imprint of this in the
      genome/epigenome

## Spatially Distributed State

- is there a good example from the epigenetics class?
- explain what I mean by spatially distributed state
- transciptomes and nucleolus
  - use Process/Program & OS metaphors to describe these

(re)-explain spatially distributed state at a high level
- && hierarchically distributed state
- && physical distribution of cells imparts some higher order
  hierarchical distribution of state (than just cellular)
  - e.g. groupings of cell types, blood brain barrier
- && physical channels as mediation of state
  - && veins/lymph system in an optimal state, will provide some
    optimal opportunity for exchange of state between tissues
  - && ventricular system in the brain (need to look into details
    here)


spatially distributed state in the nucleus
- when operations are quick and repetitive, then modified state
  quickly accumulates around the source of events
  - there is also an offset effect, where the surrounding chemical
    messengers are crowded outwards and there are physical effects
    on the solution (osmosis, pressure, etc.)
- what other ways can genetic programs execute and alter state,
  locally?


### Metanomics and Tissue Networks

#### Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Tissue Maps

- metanomics and probabilistic programming
- mapping out tissue networks in the human body using MRI (diffusion
  tensor imaging) + Yoga.
  - need to be able to map various spaces together
  - the yoga postures cause different blood flow patterns
    - and different "energy" flow patterns (by altering the flow of
      nerve impulses through the spine, arms, legs, etc)
      - engaging flexors/extensors results in those pathways/nerves
        being engaged through brain, brainstem, spine
      - this causes different energy flows
      - this is the part of yoga that "fills out" the mind-body
        connection in the brain. it's basically calibrating the brain
        for the physical state of the body.
    - tense/relaxed muscles alter blood flow
    - tensing some muscles places pressure on glands and internal
      organs, altering diffusion and fluid flow in those regions.
      - it doesn't do much, unless you have restricted movement
        patterns. most americans with a sedentary lifestyle could
        benefit from yoga.
  - statistical resolution should allow us to map out tissues by
    looking at networks of small veins and arteries down to
    capillaries
    - idea: test yoga positions for their ability to cause biomarkers
      to accumulate in specific regions of the body

- this should revolutionize cancer treatments because you can tailor
  someone's treatment plan to target specific networks of tissues
  - you can know that if you take out a set of tissue subnetworks,
    that you have taken out all of the branches leading to them
  - if the cancer is confined to that area, then you can know that
    there's a much smaller chance of it coming back
    - you have annihilated the tissue 'feeding' the cancer
    - so therefore, there should be a much lower chance of it
      returning

- this is like a "connectome" for probabilistic programming
  - the connectome is the highest level of tissue interconnection, but
    is stratified itself, as it's a tree
  - the brain has a connectome and this can be observed by using
    diffusion tensor imaging and some learning
  - but the yoga in the methodology inserts some known level of
    variance into the system of veins/arteries for specific areas of
    the body
  - those areas get more blood and open up
    - the MRI images can be sewn together and with enough imaging
    - then a highly accurate model of the connectome for the brain and
      other organs can be constructed

# Spatially distributed state on the Macro Scale

### Methodology & Data Analysis for More Proficient MRI

- many ways to increase proficiency for interpolating & extrapolating
  from MRI data. {like... ? was there somethign else here?}

#### 3D Morphology for pre/processing MRI DATA

- pre/process MRI data using morphology, making inferences to
  interpolate data, so that higher resolution can be acheived
  - {however, NMR/MRI data occurs in slices, but i'm almost certain
    I've seen this technique used somewhere since}
- 

overview of ideas/methods:

### Targeted Drug Delivery & Activation Via TMS or Ultrasound

Develop macromolecule containers which act as containers for:

- traditional drug delivery
- delivery of RNA/DNA/Virus for genetic engineering

These macromolecule containers either react to magnetism, ultrasound
or some other localized simulus

- e.g. a protein with a ferromagnetic iron ion embedded in the
  structure can act as a subunit in a simple macromolecule
  - this protein's subunits could mimic something found in nature, but
    it needs to react to magnetism, ultrasound or NMR vibrations
    - I think these are way to faint to trigger any action
- the point is, if some generic mechanism for this can be created,
  drugs can be more efficiently targeted in such a way that does not
  require tissue-specific protein activation factors

### Treatment for Traumatic Brain Injury via Placement of Neural Stem Cells (NSC)

think of it as like LASIK for Traumatic Brain Injury

this is a high-level idea which has been explored before. with
machine learning and MRI data, it should be possible to identify:
- weakened neural structures
- disconnected neural structures (networks, etc) in the brain.

e.g. it might be possible to determine locations of lesions causing
specific neurological signs/symptoms
- obviously, this can be done to some degree on the macro scale
- what I'm talking about is identifying the places in the brain
  responsible for driving neurological symptoms (alexia, dysarthria,
  etc) but moreso on the micro scale.
  - the goal would be to identify places in which neural stem cells
    could be surgically placed to correct damage done to neural
    networks from lesions

this would require examining the electrical activity of neural
circuits in the human brain while if functions normally and comparing
it to a model for normal human neural activity.
- EEG isn't going to cut it. fMRI won't work. I don't know what
  mechanism PET uses. I don't think they are going to be small-scale
  or realtime enough
- so, if someone had a Broca's lesion, they would want to understand
  the structure of that region of the brain at a micro-scale
  - they would want to compare how the patient's neural circuitry was
    functioning & compare it to how similar neural circuitry
    interoperates in that region.
    - and again, compare a model of the patient's electrical/ionic
      activity for specific higher-order regions of their brain with
      that of neurotypical people

additionally, if a method of [robitic] surgical implantation of Neural Stem
Cells seems unsafe or leads to complications, such as disregulated
localized growth of neurons,
- then it may be possible to use the method listed above:
  macromolecule drug delivery targeted via TMS/etc
- i.e. localized direction & application of neurotrophic growth
  factors.

# Misc Questions

What is the effect of NMR on Lipids? Could vacuoules be constructed
with lipids that have a known varying isotopic ratio?
- this seems like it might be the perfect means of introducing
  controlled noise into MRI
  - if it's something like a vacuole, the structure should react in
    varying degrees to its surroundings, etc.
  - the vacuole could be filled with D20 instead of H20, which would
    further change how it interacts
  - again, the goal is to introduce controlled, known noise during MRI
    - this will help greatly in mapping out micro/macro structures in
      the brain

### Chemotherapy

- chemotherapy is chemical research into chemicals which activate
  certain gene networks by up/down regulating upstream promoters with
  specific chemical triggers
  - therefore, knowledge & research for chemotherapy can be used to
    trigger cancer by developing knowledge/research of chemicals which
    upregulate tumor promotors and downregulate tumor suppressors
    - these are the opposite effects that cancer research is searching
      to discover.
    - however, cancer research DOES discover in the process of its
      research because it's attempting to quantify metrics that are
      oblique (non-orthogonal) to the same kind of data used to prove
      that a cancer drug is safe and effective.
  - these are the perfect slow poisons. they can be used to
    intentionally upregulate certain genetic behaviors, perhaps
    permanently if they trigger specific genetic processes.
  - chemotheraphy agents are system-wide up/down activators of genetic
    programming. therefore, across the overall system, they easily
    influence the dynamics higher-order system behavior.
