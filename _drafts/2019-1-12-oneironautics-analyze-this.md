# Intro

# A Dream About A Great Dane

- Date: sometime before Nov 26th, 2016

#### dream where this dog (a great dane) kept licking my face

- i saw a kind of silvery coated great dane
- i'm not sure how i met the dog. i was in some building with open
  space and open floors, like a dance studio, but in the back area
- when i met the dog, she was with her owner, who was also a
  photographer (very famous locally or something)
  - the dog seemed to be one who had been raised somewhere like floyd
    and wasn't accustomed to meeting people very often. This i
    reflected upon in the dream.
  - it's personality seemed to indicate that she wasn't guarded and
    never needed to be reprimanded for being a dog.
    - the dog didn't seem to know what it meant to be a dog.
- anyways, the dog saw that i was kinda down.
  - it had something to do with the night before and being alone
  - she immediately started licking my face, which i normally hate,
    but i just didn't do anything.
    - she kept doing it for a few minutes and the owner thought it was
      hilarious... i have no idea it was a dream
- the owner tried set us up for a photo, but in doing so, the dog
  suddenly lost interest in licking my face which prompted our
  interest in the first place.
  - no matter what we did or how we tried to egg her on, she wouldn't
    do it anymore after that.
- kind of a wierd dream, but there was a point to it, i promise

# A Dream About A Cat

- Date: night of March 8th, 2018

#### dream where i found a cat just outside my house that i thought was my cat from childhood (named roxanne)

- the dream was fairly lucid in that it felt real, like i was making
  real decisions with the full capacity of my mind, although i didn't
  realize it was a dream.
  - it was a dream i entered after meditating for a while
- i was walking out of the house to go somewhere (from my bedroom) and
  found the cat close by the door. the cat felt familiar, so i brought
  it into the house. i thought it was Roxanne. my mom was talking to
  an old friend who was meeting her for brunch or something.
  - the cat seemed to want attention, but did not want me to see
    something. the more kept playing with it and petting it, the more
    obvious it became that something was wrong.
  - the cat gradually started to morph from my persian cat to one with
    shaven hair and finally changing color from soft black into a
    tabby cat. it had a dark green and grey coat with with dark, thin
    stripes.
  - suddenly i realized it wasn't my cat, it was a stray. i finally
    realized what i sensed it was hiding from me. it was missing it's
    left front leg, but in it's place was the poorly healed untreated
    remnants of a leg.
    - i immediately wondered whether it had been hit by a car. and
      began to realize i couldn't let it go. it hadn't wanted me to
      sense what was wrong with it because it had the experience of
      being rejected for it's injuries.
    - i started crying in the dream and immediately woke up

- this cat seems to react to its own injuries/scars similarly ...
  that I've been afraid to hide from other people. years ago, i
  wouldn't have wanted to burden others with my pain. i lost the drive
  to hold anything back a long time ago when i figured out people were
  counting on me being quiet, for whatever reason. most people would
  simply be too embarrassed, anxious or afraid to speak out if they've
  been through what i've been through, especially understanding what i
  know know about what happens to those who talk about their
  psychological scars. my hesitation was originally centered in
  misunderstanding the causes: from 2010-2015, i actually thought my
  scars were a product of extremely bad luck in my career and my own
  obsession with ruminating on failure. i didn't understand that
  people engineered by psychological torture. after i started writing
  about it and people tried to convince me to unpublish everything i
  had written on it, it felt wrong and i decided that i didn't care
  about the impact on my employability. i was not going to be talked
  down so long as there was a chance for my writing to help others
  avoid the same pain. i still didn't understand what had really
  happened or the extent of everything that I was still being
  subjected to. i don't understand the full scope of consequences that
  writing about my negative experiences has had: it's almost as though
  everyone in my life has read a memo that says: DO NOT DISCUSS
  VERBOTEN TOPICS WITH DAVID CONNER.

### About the cat dream?

(2018/12/18) My reaction today? Fuck that cat! now... hear me out. I
would never be that cat: I will always wear my scars proudly. I also,
would never ever push that cat away. In fact, someone traumatized by
forces beyond their control (or within their control) should never be
pushed away. That's wrong. I gravitate towards these people or
animals, even though they may have

#### Notes

- similar to my brother's cat? (cat with anxiety/ptsd. successfully
  interacting with their cat is similar to interacting with me: make a
  quick connection, but don't linger to long because the interaction
  will almost certainly take an unfavorable course after 3 minutes)


# A Dream About A Flood and Calculated Manslaughter

- TODO: date?

### dream where someone tried to set me up to drown in a flood

- (when writing this, separate the dreams & my injection of
  interpretations)

Basically, someone from my childhood tried to set me up in a situation
where I would die and should could claim it was an accident. IRL, she
is a friendly older woman figure that I trust, so let's call her
Alice.

#### Starting with Porn

I don't even fucking know. It was something like VR porn. I was in it?
But there was also a tape involved. The time and events here were
fairly unclear. This is wierd, but I'm including this because it's
strong imagery opening the dream must be correlated to the rest of the
dream.

It certainly wasn't clear how I got from this situation to the
next. This didn't feel like the kind of dream that was analytically
generated by a mind submerged in sleep, yet it did seem to include
many of the same features.

#### Posting on Facebook

- the next thing I remember is writing a post on facebook. this is
  wierd because I don't usually dream about digitized means of
  interaction.
  - Interactions in my house? Dreams with these themes occur
    often. Interactions set in some natural environment are more
    frequent. Urban environments or corporate environments are rare,
    although walking or driving on the road is a theme that crops up
    often.

#### Finding myself in her car

- I next found myself in her car, a Red SUV. It was raining hard and
  flooding. As I looked over to the river, the waters were still
  mostly contained before they breached over the road, but as time
  progressed the strangely murky brown waters, quickly began to
  chaotically eat the road. In the dream this transition occured on a
  timescale that seemed to happen in seconds.
  - As it did, my attention was on the murkiness of flooding rivers
    that toss sediment about: this appearance is an phenomenon of
    optical occlusion in water with suspended solutes of many
    different sizes. The light doesn't reflect/refract evenly
    throughout the liquid. I noticed this effect in the way the waters
    unevenly began washing over the road. To me, it appeared that the
    water wasn't were it seemed to be, but it was tossing about
    fast. This made it difficult to see where the road was and where
    it wasn't. This is where I started to feel impending danger, but
    not distrust.

#### Getting Close the the River

Alice started driving the car towards a road near the river. It was
one of those moments of danger where you either ask questions about
"hey, where are we going" or you don't or you just figure it out. Oh
joy! We're going towards danger! How you react in those moments and
how you let someone control your descent is critical to your survival,
should you ever be targeted.

As she approached that road, instead she began to cross grass down a
very mild slope. To me, in signaling how I should respond, was perhaps
the most critical dream. She was calm and presenting me a neutral
reaction, looking right at me, while her steering wheel was bouncing
around in response to the mild, but someone turbulent motion of the
change in terrain. However, she wasn't simply letting the steering
wheel bounce around, she was anticipating the correlation of its
motion and moving it to exacerbate its motion. These are like many
other moments in life, where I began to recognize incredibly malicious
cognizance. She read and *felt* the correlation of the steering wheels
motion and exacerbated it, but was also simultaneously not trying to
lose control of the car. WHY?! Because she was considering the tire
tracks in her mind. If the motion of the car were exaggerated
*slightly*, then it would add to a narrative useful *after the course
of events*, which were supposedly an accident.

As she started to act, I remember that the post was an anticipation of
a similar course of events: I felt that the flood brought with it some
kind of danger; that some set of events would unfold, where the
environment would create the opportunity for someone to act against
me.

#### Being Trapped in Beside a Small Ridge, where the door couldn't open

She had piloted the car, so that it would spin around and pin the
passenger side door against a small ravine. Her intent was apparently
to have me blocked in, but given

#### Having the Waters of the Flooding River Whip the Car around.

This saved my life. Since I had my murder on my mind and my mind on my
own impending murder, I was like "Oh shit! This is happening now. Get
that fucking door open. Bye!"

So, even though I had been trapped against a ravine, this seems to
have been a whole in the labyrinth. The waters whipped the car around
and, since my mind had been waiting for my chance to act, I opened the
door as soon as I could. While this was happening, the single fear on
my mind was not one of drowning, but one of having not taken total
action while I had the change: I was focused on the fear of having
been trapped in a submerged car where the water would no longer permit
the door to open.

#### Seeing my friend peering back up from the waters

She had made it out and was safe. Here, I began looking down into the
river as if floating above it. I saw a friend from childhood looking
back up from it. This was nearby the bridge, so the imagery of the
bridge was "above" me when i was peering into the waters. Visually,
the image was presented to me as though the muddy waters of the river
were simply faded away, like the cheesy 70's "fade" transition between
two rolling reels of film. It was as if the statement "peering through
the waters" was interpreted as a command by the generative facets of
my dreaming mind. He looked back up at me, standing on a road. I got a
feeling that he was involved somehow.

#### Starting to talk to the First Responders

Here there was a lot of waiting. EMT's and police were collecting
details for insurance purposes, since her car had been swept away, but
I began to fear their involvement. I did not want to immediately
contest what had just happened because anyone who was aware that what
had just happened was the product of someone's intention to harm me
would selectively filter out information useful to my side of the
story from any public records. See the footnotes to see what has been
so conditioned into my subconscious that it fuels the paranoia in my
dreams[^third-amendment-is-toast].

- instead of focusing on the *murky* truth that she had just tried to
  kill me, which would be difficult to prove, i instead began focusing
  on how to help her account for the situation she *tried to create*
  where her car was swept away by the flood, so that she would be
  alright, for insurance purposes.

- there was an eerie pause in developments here. *in the dream*, i
  became aware that these people were waiting to hear my response
  because they all needed to react to it.
  - it was here that i noticed details were being collected "for
    ensurance purposes". I assumed that people's eerie anticipation to
    see how i reacted indicated their cognizance of an operation.

#### [She] was taken somewhere else

gradually, the

#### Being Forced to Walk Home

No one was concerned with my safety or my escape from death. I was
basically forced to walk home

#### Meeting Friends Nearby (they were walking towards the river & scene of accident)



#### Walking With Friends Across the Bridge (Near the Railroad Tracks & River)

- all the friends were from high school (KM, BC, ... those are the
  only faces I remember)
  - they were walking towards the river.
- when they met me, the didn't want to stay. i started trying to
  question why they were physically moving away from me, which quickly
  became accusatory "oh, so you can't be associated with me, huh?"
  basically...
  - at this point, they slowly turned around and were "with" me as i
    trekked up the hill, but they were intentionally moving
    faster. they perhaps just wanted it to look like they cared enough
    to turn around. they started to walk faster and eventually ditched
    me, making accusatory statements about "nazi this, donald trump
    that"

#### Warping To A Skating Rink in South Caroline

... Where my mom wanted to get some pictures taken. I don't think she
yet knew what had happened, but I'm not sure she would care. Not
really.  When I got there, DJ equipment started falling to the
floor. yet, i don't think the focus on the DJ equipment was
strong. The lighting was blue, the floor glowed and there was more
emphasis on lighting and music.

#### Why did this dream seem different?


- IM cerebrolysin, before i went to sleep, perhaps made the dream's
  imagery stronger, with a longer and more continuous narrative

- many details were coherent with someone's intent to murder and make
  it look like an accident

- some of these, really, wouldn't likely come from my subconscious
  mind, but perhaps. It is possible.

### Notes on last dream

-


# Dream Where Trump Tried to Give Me X-Mas Presents and I Got Drugged

#### I went to the beach with my family

- there were scenes in a condo. i don't remember much of anything at
  this point, but there is quite a bit of content and narrative here

#### A lady I hadn't met before acted familiar and asked about my writing

- in kind of a superficial way. so she could say she was authentically
  concerned for my goals, when i didn't necessarily feel that she
  would care to help me advance them or would refrain from passive
  aggressively disrupting me from my writing
  - (which has been a recurring theme in my life ever since the night
    I wrote an article about a potential **universal language** among
    aliens that would allow for communication at twice the speed of
    light. my brother and mom confronted me to try to send me to a
    mental institution the next morning, before i had published. i had
    to stream the whole thing on periscope w/o their knowledge to
    attempt to avoid it.)
    - i don't know what it was about this article in particular that
      prompted a response from people, nor can i explain how they
      communicated about it to get my brother at my house for that
      specific conversation at 8:30am, but in my mind, it was almost
      certainly a response to what i was writing. to me, this was an
      indication that i was under surveillance and my family knew
      about it.
    - they were strongly engaging in what i was beginning to learn
      were tactics for disruption. it was very strong and they did not
      want to hear about what i was writing.
    - it also came out of nowhere. there was no other real stimulus to
      prompt the one-sided "discusson" where my mom and my brother
      cornered me and the sole focus was to convince me to seek
      psychiatric help.

#### We ended up needing to go to the hospital

- for something related to someone else's health *apparently*.
  - there wasn't much focus on this in the dream
  - (after the dream, I felt like this hospital visit was so that
    doctors and medical staff could unofficially establish a genial
    rapport with me to try to anticipate how I would present symptoms
    when I was drugged which would lead me to be psychiatrically
    hospitalized)

#### we showed up to a baseball stadium

- i'm not sure whether i knew where we were going before we got
  there. i don't remember. everything was vividly visual.

#### trump led me up the stairs towards the boxes, but we didn't go in

- at the top of the stairs, he sat down, blocking the path to the
  boxes. (my interpretation was that he was symbolically positioning
  himself at the top)

- during the dream, i recall having seen a video or something that
  explained how trump likes people to sit in a very specific place on
  the stairs. basically, if i wanted to please him, then i would sit
  in this location.
  - i started to comply with this, but then felt uncertain. i didn't
    want to project compliance necessarily, but independence.
    - i didn't want to pick a place to sit based On what i had been
      told or subtly introduced to through some social media video or
      whatever.
  - so i awkwardly tilled around and couldn't decide where to sit.
    - i kept moving up and down a region of three or four stairs,
      sometimes sitting on the ledge beside it (which was the location
      i was compelled to feel would indicate compliance)
    - he was implicitly blocking the top of the stairs

#### trump started trying to pay me off (... not in any serious way though)

- i think he was just tempting me.
- he asked "So what do you want?" in a coy kind of way, but i could
  tell what he was getting at. he asked it like i could get anything i
  wanted.
  - i looked around and fairly quickly said "Nothing"
- he then asked me "SOOOO... what'd you get for christmas?"
  - i took this as a sly attempt to read into what I would like,
    in a manner less conspicuous than quid pro quo.
  - i said "i haven't bought any Christmas presents for anyone for
    five years, asshole."
  - he about fell over. I felt bad for some reason, since it was
    probably more accurate to blame Obama for most of that five years.
  - so i said "i'm sorry"

#### Trump handed me a pill bottle in a clear bag

- the pill bottle was in what looked like an evidence bag. i thought
  it was my adderal prescription
  - (which i'm supposed to get tomorrow, but my mom is haggling with
    me and generally back to giving me a hard time about things that
    actually help me make progress)
    - she's being an ignorant bitch. she never listens to me. i'm in a
      state of values-debasement from protracted, constant negative
      reinforcement. there is no positive reinforcement applied, for
      anything. there is no acknowledgement of reality, when it comes
      to my goals, my skills or anything that happens to me in an
      "operation"

- he threw them down one or two stairs and i picked them up.
  - after i did, i looked behind him and there were a dozen or so
    similar bags of pills.

#### I hadn't taken any of the pills and i started feeling drugged

- at this point, my mom re-enters(?) the dream. she notices that I'm
  drugged, but doesn't admit it, instead *preferring* to blame it on
  the medication
  - (which she loathes so much, since it represents the ability to
    learn and get things done, but which she can also project as a
    horrible addictive drug)
    - blah blah fucking blah blow it out your fucking ass, bitch
  - (this scenario of having been drugged by a strange form of
    "adderal" or being drugged after receiving a bottle of adderal is
    something that, in 2016, seemed to happen 3 or 4 times)
    - every time i try to explain to other people what happens, they
      PRETEND to not understand anything that I'm saying. they get
      away with "playing stupid" because they have so successfully
      pretended to be stupid my entire fucking life.
- i recognize that i'm drugged. to me, in the dream, it's the same
  feeling i recognized from 12/5/2016 and 12/22/2018. it's the feeling
  i dread because it's the one i've only experienced twice (or maybe
  three times), which corresponds to a particular feeling of losing
  control
  - (there have been 2 predominant DISTINCT feelings of being drugged
    over the past EIGHT YEARS. one is frequent and *seems* to be a
    food allergy. incredibly acidic food that *just so happens* to
    shut my fucking brain off and act as an antidote to adderal.)
    - the other feeling is one i've experienced twice.
      - BOTH DATES, i had the following side-effects:
        - (1) an increase in dermotological side-effects from adderall
          (which are only supposed to happen at exceedingly high doses
          for dextro-amphetamine
        - (2) 10-20 hours after i began feeling drugged, i developed
          RESTFUL LEG SYNDROME. i have only ever had these symptoms
          TWICE: on 12/5/2016 and 12/23/2018 ... and both times, the
          symptoms were short-lived, appeared in bursts and STOPPED
          AFTER 24-48 hours. I WAS DRUGGED> I WAS FUCKING DATE-RAPED
          AND MANY PEOPLE KNEW IT *BOTH TIMES*
      - it seems to be something that can be delivered in incredibly
        small volumes, which is exactly what would happen if
        CIA/FBI/DHS manufactured small amounts of drugs to be used in
        operations.
      - the drugs would be a subset of pharmaceuticals with some of
        these requirements:
        - high heat tolerance
        - high range of tolerance to pH
        - tasteless, odorless
        - preferably an orally active peptide (in the 21st century)
        - variable duration of action dependent on the operational
          requirements
        - a potential kill-switch (to act as an antidote to return the
          target to a normal psychiatric state)
        - predictable metabolic pathways
        - predictable set of side effects
        - AN EXTREMELY LIMITED SET OF CONTRAINDICATED PHARMACEUTICALS
          *AND* SUPPLEMENTS
    - if i had to name a drug it would be "scopalamine" like the
      reports in 2012 of a new drug from south american that wiped
      your memories and forced you to be controlled by someone who
      caused you to commit crimes, potentially for a period of days.
      - however, scopalamine is probabily the WORST DRUG to use for
        such an operation (it's very easily lethal)
      - BZ is a *possibility* (which is chemically related to
        Scopalamine and is very much like the drug from batman begins)
        - but i very much feel that it is in that family of drugs

#### I started to run away to get space

- i was running away from people who were physically close to me in
  the dream, but i kept coming back to them. (i was still in the
  baseball stadium environment)
  - each time i encountered them, they would tell me about how i
    looked like i was acting different or strange, YET I HAD NOT TOLD
    THEM ABOUT FEELING DRUGGED. I was avoiding them becuase of their
    imposition and their controlling tendencies
    - (when they should not *know the cause* for my vulnerability,
      which is exactly what happens IN REAL LIFE, practically whenever
      disruption is needed, but especially at times when I should
      watch my fucking back)

#### I started feeling increasingly trapped

- my mom said "What are you doing, David? You've just goin in a big
  circle" in a falsely consoling tone, as if to say "nothing you're
  doing right now makes sense", which is exactly the kind of bullshit
  she tries to feed me constantly -- when there *is* purpose to my
  actions, but her motivation is to disrupt me from my goals.

[^third-amendment-is-toast]: I've been the target of conspiracies
    before and I know that when these things happen, there are more
    people *who know* than you would think. It's one way to advance
    yourself in American society: demonstrate that you're willing to
    look the other way while shitty things happen to good people or,
    *even better*, play your part. If bystanders are aware, *they are
    not innocent*, they function as cleanup crews: they identify and
    contain the causal consequences of information that sticks out and
    contradicts the official narrative. If they identify that the
    official narrative will not *stick*, then they prefer to suppress
    any and all information related to the situation: *nothing will
    come out*. They *wall in* the socioinformational consequences of
    operations.

    That's why I choose to play detective on my own and collect
    information to use as one might use extra cards in a hand of
    poker. I'm better at being a detective anyways, apparently. I
    would rather force my adversaries into being over-confident about
    lying, so that I can surprise everyone with new information later
    on. They are not going to play fair with you and you should not
    play "fair" with them. This becomes useful in demonstrating how
    *everyone involved fabricates, selectively lies and suppresses
    information to my detriment*. The problem with such a strategy is
    that good people get caught up in the misinformation: they do not
    like looking bad when a conspiracy begins to emerge and so they
    will also choose to suppress information.

    **Remember: this will always proceed in a manner that is selectively
    detrimental to the target.** That is how *operations* work, they
    process the *target* to an increasingly vulnerable state.
    Everyone involved abuses the system to advance that goal: for
    someone who is truly a target, the system will never allow itself
    to advance the target's goals or the target's protection. THUS,
    THE SYSTEM IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. Work outside of the system and you
    might just survive. In fact, if you are a target, involving other
    people becomes risky for their safety. Involve them as much as
    possible.  This is also their fight. No one asked for an America
    like this. People need to see this for what it is, until the
    authorities no longer feel free to operate maliciously with
    impunity. **Rule of law**.

    **You're probably not a target,** so keep that in mind. There are
    several reasons no one hears about *operations*: &#x9312; they are
    well covered up &#x9313; the authorities process the target into a
    marginalized, vulnerable state so they can act without
    socioinformational consequences and &#x9314; operations like this
    just don't happen very often. The system usually has much better
    ways of manipulating a potential target into handling themselves
    by encouraging the target to become associated with crime, become
    violent, etc. You practically have to be as clean as Jesus Christ
    to survive such processing and marginalization because they
    encourage you to become insane or legally vulnerable, so they can
    throw you away in a trash can marked either PRISON or MENTAL
    INSTITUTION.

    If you are a target, be wary because these people do not play nice,
    they do not have rules, the system exists to protect their
    existence from ever being publicly acknowledged and they will not
    hesitate to trash your life and torch your family tree *on a
    whim*. That's right, the 3rd Amendment is toast. THE THIRD
    AMENDMENT. That should frighten you. It means that you are
    essentially being quartered with soldiers. *Target* is a term with
    military implications. In combat, only people who are targeted can
    be engaged with force, lethal or otherwise. If you are a literal
    target, they are likely not going to kill you, but it is in the
    cards. They would much rather put you in a mental institution.
    That's often what it means to be "crazy" in America: you got
    targeted.
