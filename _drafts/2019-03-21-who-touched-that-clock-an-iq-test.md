"Have you ever bought a cheap, battery-powered clock, only to wonder a
few months later: who keeps changing the time?"

#### Part ① Have you ever experienced this? Why does it happen? Answer first, then read the answer below.

- i thought of our clock at Tech when I saw this. it kept getting
  stuck and off-time. this is why. (i posted on the SHS page, but it
  didn't show up)

=======

I'm sure it happens at half of all college apartments at least once,
making a kind of rite-of-passage IQ test. The rate of work is not
constant in mechanical analog clocks. Thus, when the battery's power
output is low and the temperature fluctuates, the clock can stop only
to start again when the temperature renormalizes.

No one entered your house and toyed with the clock. It's simply the
impact of thermal change on the battery's power output.

#### Part ② In particular, what are the least efficient gear positions? Assume what you like about the system of gears, but assume the minute hand and hour hand both weigh the same.

Again, answer first if you like, then read the answer below.

=======

The most expensive gear positions are times where the hand's are all
on the left side of the clock.

#### Part ③ What math would allow you to model this physical system with a cyclic state machine?

Did you picture the combinatorial system of gear positions, abstracted
from time? Can you imagine doing the same for other physical systems?
What other physical systems require reasoning about cyclic
#StateMachines, combinatorially?

Reasoning about this can unlock your brain's ability to intuitively
reason about physical systems using #Combinatorial #HopfAlgebra, which
augments reasoning about efficient efficient gear construction in more
expensive clocks with #ContinuousMotion WHILE GUARANTEEING ACCURACY,
without worrying about variations in energy consumption.
