  - hacker news post

blog on why i don't drive
- as protest
- because of barrier to entry

blog on skiima-cohort-report
- convert to an example project for skiima
- blog about it.  convert it to a rails project?
- also set up an example rails project for skiima, showing a dashboard
  and etc

- on becoming a philosopher (more interesting title?)
  - progressing beyond the physical and beyond tree-based modeling
    - moving towards categorical thinking
  - discovering self-similarity and it's importance "getting to the meta"
    - discovering metaphenomina and epiphenonina
  - discovering and knowing your own beliefs.
    - having your own experience before trying to understand the great thinkers
  - approaching formlessness: the importance of forms and formlessness
  - how to observe?
    - how do we observe others if we don't know how to observe ourselves?
      - ... there is something more here?
  - tabula rasa, zen and the art of beginning
    - it's important to observe yourself as you know knothing
      - but how can you know to do this or know how to do this
        - if you most crucially need to observe yourself as you know nothing?
      - how does one instill the art of observing the right things in themselves if they know nothing?
    - these are classic problems that have been poured over and meditated on for millenia
      - particularly the zen thing i just mentioned,
        - which stems from buddhist thought
          - which stems from hindi thought
  - which brings me to my next point
    - everything that has been done has been done countless times before
      - [lead into examples? or fully develop thoughts first]
      - ancient math was developed that acted as the basis for ancient philosophic logic & thought
        - Banach–Tarski paradox is incredibly important and i believe developed in ancient times
          - i cannot recall what it is crucially important in philosophy
          - this is completely baseless by the way.
          - [enumerate ancient philosophic applications]

- economics, stocks & commodities - how do fluxuating currency values affect investment decisions
  - already complicated enough b4 taking into account how fluctuating currencies affect portfolio/demand
  - other tweets that i can turn into 3,000 word articles?

- how do 'anaphorized' and 'cataphorized' grammatical structures
  - affect language and the development of the brain?
  - what subtle differences are caused by languages that have cataphoric inflexion of grammer
    - versus those who have pronouncedly less.
  - by cataphoric inflexion, i mean your brain constantly has to think a little ahead
    - if i'm asking a question "how do[es] ... "
      - i have to subconsciously think about the subject before rendering the ve
        - does the verb need to be inflected plural or singular?
        - it depends on the subject of course
      - i only have thought about this because of subtle neurological symptoms
    - this is also true for lots of other grammitic subtleties in many languages
      - but pronouncedly moreso in indo-european languages
        - especially in those languages that differentiate on gender
      - and pronouncedly less so in languages like japanese and mandarin
        - they do not have the same problem because they usually avoid gender altogether
          - and usually pluralization, too.  unless the plurality is specified.
  - so what are the effects on native speakers in expression and on cognitive patterns?

blog about all the blogs i haven't written
- blog/video on obstacles in my life (transportation problems, scheduling problems)
- article about inspiring people in my life (personal connections)
- how to monetize my writing??!
- a paradox of originality (see notes)
  - where teh !@#$ are these notes?
  - ahhh, i had the thought again (20151230) and it's profound (see notes)
    - they're in "paradox-of-creativity.md"
- automated-vehicle-vulnerabilities (see notes)
- maths (see notes)

- the internet as a new age library of alexandria
  - how to fight information warfare while preventing balkinization ... how to do this??
  - disappearance of physical manifestations of information
  - why we must protect against a total-reset, as well as corruption of knowledge
- the manifestation of the metaphysical through the singularity
- 10 negative career experiences
- the girl who channelled my genius
- computer vision and psychedelics
  - disrupting existing neural networks is exactly why psychedelics can be beneficial
- genetics as a probabilistic program
- article(s) on differential diagnosis for MS, ALS, HD, PME's, LD and other neurodegenerative disorders
- vulnerability of homogenous belief systems
- hypothetical /net/null attacks:
  - far too easy to hijack/manipulate unencrypted network connections using routing protocol attacks
  - e.g. reroute unencrypted IRC messages, then balance out the packets for that app
    - so that to the client, it appears that messages have been sent
      - that is, ACK packets are received
    - but no one actually sees those messages
  - called /net/null because it's similar to sending output to /dev/null
  - an attack like this would be fairly easy to identify,
    - but only if someone knew what to look for
  - i had this idea over two years ago
    - it is a next obvious step in the development of a surveillance state
      - to not only surveil content, but to intelligently manipulate it
- specialized hardware capabilities (esp. CPU/GPU architecture) augment VR, but at the same time, threaten it's market viability
  - talk about divergent hardware threatening the viability of VR devices by making it far too complicated for consumers
    - software can help to some degree, but the complexity of software required to fix this means delayed development
  - if AR/VR does not *QUICKLY* achieve market penetration and consumer adoption,
    - the tech may face a setback of years
- differences in learning CS through academics and through experience
  - why CS is all about
    - without consciously understanding the math behind cs
      - you'll constantly be solving the same problems as though they are each different
  - however, the mentality that every problem is the same leads to problems in those academically inclined
    - they see the same problem everywhere and believe that every problem that fits a mold/patterm has the same answer
    - when in fact, there are some problems/algorithms which can be made more efficient than it appears at first glance
      - and it is precisely because of the subtleties of the domain of the problem.
      - e.g. bioinformatics string-neighborhood can be accelerated
- post on the qualities of great people (see draft)

- series on linux distros (linuxi)
  -
- article on building/installing a bootloader, securely



- man should prove himself wise enough to preserve nature as it is before attempting to alter it

- quasi-religious ideals
  - acting as though you literally are the other person
    - if we are all one, then this is true
  - accessing your future self and your genius
  - cultivating your connection with God
    - whatever you may believe to be god
  - cultivating virtues and leadership in yourself and others
  - living your life as though it was a movie and you're the hero
    - what's your story?
    - this mindset could go horribly wrong, so how to limit it?
      - e.g. someone has the wrong view of reality, does something horrible
      - or someone decides to be the villain
  - thinking outside of time
  - thinking outside the box by lifting arbitrary constraints and taking concepts to their limits
    - what happens if i take that to infinity? e.g.
      - what if the speed of communication were infinite
      - what if all knowledge was omnipresent
      - what if cost of energy was no longer a constraint
    - ignore technological constraints
      - what if the speed of light was not a limitation
    - simulate ancient models of thought
      - think hard about problems without cheating by applying today's knowledge/technology
      - how would aristotle have reached these conclusions?
      - could the ancient greeks known this and if so, how did they reach those conclusions?
- as we hurtle towards relative omniscience and relative omnipotenc
  - isn't it important for us to discuss what makes a group worthy of ...
    - ... "handling this power?" i think that's what i meant to write

- ancient people's knowledge was far more advanced than we give them credit for
  - quite often, a system observed with less information is more simply understood than when perceiving the same system with much more info.
  - this phenomenon results in modern man's misapprehension that our supposedly more acute vision of reality offers more complete comprehension
- blog on ancient calendar systems and why it takes so long to measure the 365 day calendar year
  - and how an ancient people would progress through verifying the 365 calendar year
    - how long would it take for them to recognize a leap year and why?
    - how long would it take for them to regognize each further fraction of a leap year
      - how would they explain this?
    - how would weather affect these measurements?
  - how this was a challenge for early civilization and encouraged the preservation of knowledge
    - additionally, this was another catalyst for myth
    - and a catalyst for measure the world around us
  - how would ancient people begin to approach measuring the stars
  - ancient people's fascination with stars,
    - as they were the most dependable, most stable phenomenon of their world

## Math

- universiality of math should be evident in th progresson of alien computing technology.
  - computers are physical manifestations of certain kinds of math
  - aliens, at least terrans, should similarly progress through materials and computing technologies
  - likely had similar processor architectures and similar distinctions between computer languages (alien lisp)
  - aliens need to solve many of the same problems we do for technology
    - so they likely need to have very similar experiments to do so
    - and they make many of the same breakthroughs in a simliar progression
  - aliens then observing us would understand the problems we are facing
    - and those we are about to face
  - there would be many differences though, based on:
    - availability of resources, form/function of species and speciation
    - defining qualities of environment and the form of intelligent life
    - specific progression of technology
    - cataclysmic events

- measuring the degree to which inner/outer neural networks
  - are disrupted by variations in input and correlate this to the performance of the network
  - using this as an important meta-measure of how well these certain phenomena are captured by the network
  - an example of something that maybe should not be published

Applied Category Theory:
- introduction to category theory
- automated construction of literature using tropes, scenarios, themes & other tools (doesn't necessarily involve writing)
- transformations between languages (phonetics and translations)
- automated writing by construction of trees of information and application of writing techniques/styles
- transforming Lisp functions & AST's to construct new functions.  conceptual understanding of AST's.
- modeling social behavior using category theory (part 2)
- bytecode inspection for vulnerabilities
- bytecode inspection for performance enhancements.  identifying algorithms which could instead be GPU accelerated.
- ancient forms of math
- teaching category theory with graffiti
- language to transform webapp to xml, renderable to native app
- how-to visualize a hyperdimensional grid
- combine two AST's into a third using another data structure with a list of mappings.
- factoring primes with complex numbers?
- why computer vision is such a hard problem
  - humans recognize objects in 4D, not 3D
- knowledge of higher-order math allows people to compress information and learn faster
  - especially for knowledge related to data manipulation, networks, api's, programming languages, etc.
  - you can more easily see similarities between things
  - new problems and technologies are simply a reformulation of old ideas
- spatial breakdown of pop-n-lock dance moves

## Technology

- how the shift to VR/AR changes the tech economic landscape
  - less need for traditional user-interfacing hardware
  - more need for software/networking/wearables/micro-computer
  - wearables will set fashion trends, as the most popular & most functional will set the tone for form/function
  - very little need for monitors
  - this is all very dependent on battery power
- why we need to get as many people to understand technology as possible
  - bc the next may be the last generation that has a **need** to learn about technology
  - therefore, if it's a threat we need to have as many people as possible who understand it
  - and why preparing for technology in this way will accelerate it's development
- defending yourself against an Omniscient/Omnipotent adversary
  - like say, a rogue department of an intelligence agency or the inevitable nemisis of AI
- how the singularity and surveillance will promote occult techniques
  - why this is good and bad
- updates in 3D graphics for VR/AR
  - How do 3D graphics requirements change with VR/AR?
  - How do 3D graphics capabilities change with Metal/Vulkan?

  - flares on top of a row of speakers
- That time I cornered the market on a currency supply in highschool

## Science

- Climate Change, Drought and Famine
  - glaciers and mountainous regions as batteries of water.
  - depleting them leads to acquifers that don't get replentished.  eventually drought and famine.
- New theory of gravity, dark matter, "ether" and no big bang: http://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html
  - gravity is an illusion, like the centripital force, space is linked to matter, matter affects space, space affects the space around it, like a fluid.  the ether is real.
  - if the universe is 13.7 billion years old and we're not in the center of it, then there should be some space beyond which we see nothing.  if not, the big bang can't be true.
- relate hallucinogens with google's dreaming neural networks

## Physics

- Quantum Gravity & Doubly Special Relativity
  - instead of being based on Position Space
  - it is based on "Momentum Space," which is similar to a vague aha moment I had
    - where i felt that, for some reason, the curvature of space would have something to do with momentum
      - if some kind of invariance were to be preserved between 3+ observers 
        - (i think this was the line of thought i was following)


## Art

- Art that I own and why I would never sell it
- Why you don't frame art

## Philosophy

- the manifestation of the metaphysical through the singularity
  - The finite nature of the metaphysical (Graham's Number)
    - how this relates to information && information about information
    - teilhard de chardin and virtual sub-realities
  - how the metaphysical takes increasing hold on our world
    - as the speed of communication approaches zero, knowledge becomes omnipresent
    - information warfare becomes practical, effective and lightning fast
  - post-post-structuralism
    - accepting the inevitability of the totality of structuralism
    - how to fight to delay it by increasing the 'hardness' of algorithms
  - blurring languages/conceptualizations renders structuralism obsolete
    - microdialects
  - find video on gawker about this
  - demons as metaphors for metaphysical ailments
- how apocalypse works
  - ancient knowledge of overpopulation and it's inevitability
  - myths as memetic programs
- The other problem of evil
- The meaning of life
- Why astrology and numerology aren't complete bullshit
- how to fall in love
- quantum fate
- being the kind of person who brings out the best in other people
- primality of original music
- what it means to be a star
  - carbon + pressure => diamond + further pressure/light => a metaphysical star that never disappears

- the commonality of the human condition drives humanity's desire to improve it (rewrite)
  - that is, because we all understand the effects of negative/positive events in our own life
    - as well as their effects on the lives of those around us
    - we become conditioned with the desire to overcome it
  - when people witness or become aware of extremely unfair events
    - the human condition drives our desire to correct them
    - if someone has utilized unfair tactics to target someone's friends
      - then if those people become aware of these injustice's
      - they will be capable of empathizing with the strife and they will strive for justice
      - even if this means taking on some pain themselves
  - this can be harnessed to correct social injustice on a large scale
    - through non-violent intervention, such as that employed by Ghandi and Dr. King
    - at first, people like Ghandi and Dr. King were begged by their friends to just fall in line
      - to accept that which was unfair because it was "good enough" or "it could be worse"
    - but by getting attention with the right means
      - and drawing the people around them into the fight
        - who must be willing to accept pain in striving towards a better condition for everyone
      - these hero's were able to draw even more attention to injustices
    - and this is because, when people are presented with the right information from the right perspective,
      - they will almost always make the right decision
      - they will struggle for justice or change, even to their own detriment
  - this insurmountable desire for equinimity, justice and truth often lays dormant
    - but it can be tapped through the just the right push
    - and it is driven by the human condition
      - that is, the common experiences that we all face throughout our lives
      -

- exploiting buridan's principle
  - buridan's is pretty fucked up if you think about it
  - explain the original aristotolean version
    - food & water, man's halfway between both.  but he STARVES every time.
      - this is because he will choose what he thinks he needs most: the water
    - eventually, this was "simplified" to having two identical objects: bales of hay
      - this sorta simplifies it, but also greatly changes the meaning
      - and it was changed by buridan to having an the "ass" representing a simpleton.
  - buridans is great because it exemplifies problems in our own systems of ethics
    - and exemplifies how knowledge of someone's system of ethics or belief systems can be used to stagnate that person
      - wow, that's really, really, fucking depressing
    - so, if it can be used for controlling people through their belief sy
      - then it also speaks on the value of more-uniform belief systems
      - that is, if everyone has mostly random belief systems composed of a myriad of parent belief systems
        - then they are going to be a bit harder to systematically motivate
      - if the ability to systematically motivate people is valuable for whatever reasons (for evil or for good!)
        - then this speaks volumes on the value of systems for instilling similar belief & values systems
          - i.e. RELIGION
        - furthermore, if this ability to motivate others in this way is valuable and can be used for good or evil
          - then it must be guarded, so that it is available for good
      - systems of mass control are crucial for motivating people to pursue behavior
        - where the end goal of the behavior is moreso and indirect goal of their behavior
          - and perhaps the people participating in this behavior are not aware of the end goal of it at all
      - as evil as a system of mass control might sound, perhaps things like this aren't so bad
        - there are forces of evil at play in the world which can't be fought directly
        - by the way, this is where aristotle's politics and rhetoric come in to play
          - though i haven't read either, i'm just surmising from the themes of his Politics
          - it seems politics is a book about pursuing actions which obliquely support your group's agenda
      - ... phew i think i went a bit off topic there.
  - buridans variations - buridans awesome because you can easily variate it.
    - bales A & B.  ass equally distant.  ass already has bale C, you take bale C
    - one bale of hay is real and the other is fake, but the ass doesn't know which.
      - or doesn't know that one could be fake
    - buridan's + game theory.
      - example where two people are walking towards each other and need to decide who's going to move out of the way
    - or two planes flying towards each other and need to coordinate an action with limited time for communication
      - an action, where if they make a symmetric decision, will result in disaster
  - write about why it's important to make decisions ahead of time
    - and distribute decision making protocols ahead of time
    - this is important for distributed computer systems,
      - but also for people who may not be able to communicate efficiently, openly, etc
        - when needed to make a decision
    - there's a connection to category theory and monads here
    - is it possible for someone to innately contain all of this information
      - in otherwords , they have pre-decided on how to resolve every *kind* of decision they'll ever make
      - basically the ass has apriori knwoledge of every decision it will have to make
        - or at least every *kind* of decision
      - and isn't this what religion instills us with
        - early on, by studying religion, we equip ourselves with knowledge about situations
          - situations we haven't personally encountered and kinds of decisions we haven't made
        - this comes at the cost of freedom of choosing our own path and our own belief system
          - but it's just fucking useful to not have to expend the ti
            - to decide on every detail

## Esotericism

- how occult techniques work
  - how they hack the algorithms of the brain's neural network to redirect/focus a person's thoughts
  - how occult societies psychologically filter initiates and why
  - magick as a means to transfer knowledge secretly and meta-magick as setting up channels of communication
  - category theory
- magick and computer algorithms
  - raft consensus algorithm

## Education

- Centralizing and utilizing educational resources to accelerate K12 education, while maintaining the ability to experiment
- Removing math as a separate subject and teaching math through application
- how students learn math through the arts (applied category theory)

## Health/Biology

- Novel(?) problems in genetic modifications (altered gene expression results in propagation of epigenetic information to subsequent generations)
- Your body establishes patterns of gene expression during youth.  These patterns become difficult to change in adulthood
- the paradigm shift of epigenetics and it's philosophical implications:
  - http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150402161751.htm
  - http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-genome-s-spirals-loops-and-globules-come-into-4-d-view-video/
- DNA as a probabilistic program
  - differentiation of genomic programs and cell-types should be relatively flat
  - that is, there's a tree that represents the types of cells that cells can become
  - but, because of occam's razor, this tree should be flat because too much hierarchy induces too much complexity in the system
- "Improved MRI Scanning Techniques" (they already exist)
  - [Magnetization Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetization_transfer) + machine learning to recognize characteristic neuronal features
  - could this be combined with DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) methodology or models to help detail a functional map of the brain
  - do higher order patterns emerge in the resonance of hydrogen molecules around similar/disparate macromolecules?
    - if so, would these be detectable?  or does Magnetization Transfer already utilize the limits of what's possible here
    - higher order patterns may only emerge around specific cell types
    - is 3.0T MRI even strong enough to do anything here?  
  - can ion-interactions be utilized to infer more information?  particularly Sodium 23, as it's one of the primary neuro-ions
  - what can Magnetization Transfer tell us about ion-channels in the brain?  
    - if Magnetization Transfer is all about how free ions react to the presence of a strong magnetic 
  - can heavy water be used as a contrast agent?  (yes, it can - [Patent (2013)](https://www.google.com/patents/US20130142724)
    - furthermore, can heavy water be combined with MT? (would need before and after shots)
      - this would be particularly effective in the presence of contrasting agents!  ... maybe

- why you should cycle nootropics and nutritional supplements
  - some vitamins/minerals competitively inhibit absorption of others
  - nootropics and herbs taken consistently for long enough time periods cause your body/brain to adjust
  - this is also true of some medications
    - by studying how brain chemistry is altered and how genetic programs respond to various medications
      - quickly cycling medications *may in some cases* allow the brain to reach a stable point
      - at this point, some med cycling could be halted and the brain -- with a consistent diet -- 
        - may acheive stability that it could not either with consistent medication or without medicantion
  - identifying patterns of responses to various brain chemistries and especially by identifying genetic and dietary effect
    - will be incredibly useful in properly treating mental illness

- VR Manakin projects.  Implanted memories using virtual reality.
- avoiding surveillance by painting a picture online with the abundance of data
  - why this is better than simply dropping out of online activity altogether

## Government

- why communism is bullshit and is its own antithesis
  - why north korea isn't communinist (it's autocratic/military/monarchy) and why N.K. should be a synonym for full of shit
  - north koreans obviously aren't allowed to study government.  otherwise, they would know exactly how oxymoronic and [synonym for word-missing-the-meaning] they are
  - why i slightly respect chinese communism (but why it's not exactly communism)
  - what's required for communism to work and why this inherantly plants the seeds of its own destruction
    - the agencies required for surveillance gain the power and motivation for more power
    - I.E. the KGB subverting communism into oligarchy to magnify their own power.

## History

- why the Norwegian crusade was a badass medieval crusade
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Crusade
- the ancient geography of the mediteranean would have radically shifted political/economic centers of power
  - NOAA bathymetry map: https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/
  - gawker article on underwater sicilian megaliths http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X15300535
  - look for conjunction of < 100m depth and extended river pathways.
  - identify altered currents and smooth waters.
  - doggerland
    - where was the water?  what parts of the english channel/north sea show the most glacial activity?
    - compare celtic megalithic culture & sites with river locations.
      - english channel river system
    - why did cultures disperse to western england and eastern denmark?
      - probably because tsunami destroyed most of doggerland in 6,000 bc
      - which could account for the lack of megalithic culture in that region
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland
    - persion gulf flooded
  - flooding islands as impetus to develop seafaring technology.
    - large islands created around 12000BC, ever dwindling resources and expanding population
    - pushes people to develop seafaring boats to escape .. or not

## Religion

- why there will never be another world religion based on the acts of one man

## Politics

- Why TPP doesn't even make sense
- How I boycotted oil for two years
- China's plan to rule the world:
  - loan us tons of money
  - sell us shitty shit that breaks in 2 years
  - we'll spend all our money on stuff yet need to continue buying more.  remember, this is money that we've borrowed from china, yet we're giving it all back to them.  they get the money back that we borrowed, but we still owe trillions in debt.
  - meanwhile, they're pillaging all our industrial & military secrets through espionage and cyberwarfare. remember, we invested billions in researching these technologies, using the funds we borrowed from china.  we did all the hard work, yet they steal our technology.
  - build up tons of industrial infrustructure to produce these goods that america buys, while american industrial infrastructure rots.
  - ????
  - profit
- diversity & entropy
  - using entropy as a tool to mak observations about diversity
