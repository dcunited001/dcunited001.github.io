  - tabula rasa, zen and the art of beginning
    - it's important to observe yourself as you know knothing
      - but how can you know to do this or know how to do this
        - if you most crucially need to observe yourself as you know nothing?
      - how does one instill the art of observing the right things in themselves if they know nothing?
    - these are classic problems that have been poured over and meditated on for millenia
      - particularly the zen thing i just mentioned, 
        - which stems from buddhist thought

  - affect language and the development of the brain?
  - what subtle differences are caused by languages that have cataphoric inflexion of grammer

  - by cataphoric inflexion, i mean your brain constantly has to think a little ahead
    - if i'm asking a question "how do[es] ... "
      - i have to subconsciously think about the subject before rendering the verb. 
        - does the verb need to be inflected plural or singular?
        - it depends on the subject of course
      - i only have thought about this because of subtle neurological symptoms
    - this is also true for lots of other grammitic subtleties in many languages
      - but pronouncedly moreso in indo-european languages
        - especially in those languages that differentiate on gender
      - and pronouncedly less so in languages like japanese and mandarin
        - they do not have the same problem because they usually avoid gender altogether
          - and usually pluralization, too.  unless the plurality is specified.
  - so what are the effects on native speakers in expression and on cognitive patterns?

- hypothetical /net/null attacks:
  - far too easy to hijack/manipulate unencrypted network connections using routing protocol attacks
  - e.g. reroute unencrypted IRC messages, then balance out the packets for that app
    - so that to the client, it appears that messages have been sent
      - that is, ACK packets are received
    - but no one actually sees those messages
  - called /net/null because it's similar to sending output to /dev/null
  - an attack like this would be fairly easy to identify,
    - but only if someone knew what to look for
  - i had this idea over two years ago
    - it is a next obvious step in the development of a surveillance state
      - to not only surveil content, but to intelligently manipulate it
- specialized hardware capabilities (esp. CPU/GPU architecture) augment VR, but at the same time, threaten it's market viability
  - talk about divergent hardware threatening the viability of VR devices by making it far too complicated for consumers
    - software can help to some degree, but the complexity of software required to fix this means delayed development
  - if AR/VR does not *QUICKLY* achieve market penetration and consumer adoption,
    - the tech may face a setback of years
- differences in learning CS through academics and through experience
  - why CS is all about math.  
    - without consciously understanding the math behind cs
      - you'll constantly be solving the same problems as though they are each different
  - however, the mentality that every problem is the same leads to problems in those academically inclined
    - they see the same problem everywhere and believe that every problem that fits a mold/patterm has the same answer
    - when in fact, there are some problems/algorithms which can be made more efficient than it appears at first glance
      - and it is precisely because of the subtleties of the domain of the problem.

- article on [composition in storytelling](http://io9.gizmodo.com/this-video-essays-looks-at-how-films-tell-a-story-by-ho-1754696748) and architecture
  - how do directors find locations with shots that are used to create compelling image composition?
    - refer to the house at 12:30 in the video
      - this house has a specific layout that enables the shot conveying imbalance
  - this seems like a pretty complicated thing to do
    - you have certain aspects of the story, of the plot and dynamics of the characters 
      - that you want to convey through image composition
    - so first, you need to decide what those are
      - then you need to brainstorm ways of expressing them on-screen
        - i'm guessing this happens mostly at the same time locations are being identified
      - however, knowing what kind of shots you want to frame for individual scenes
        - is very important in deciding locations for those scenes
      - and this is a very complicated optimization problem
        - especially if a location is used for multiple scenes or for a majority of film content
          - that location needs to be capable of providing a myriad of scenarios and room layouts, etc
            - that provide possibilities for applying compositional techniques
        - identifying composition templates used in film certainly helps reduce the complexity of this problem
          - algorithm for analyzing building layouts to determine composition possibilities?
    - then, once you've identified suitable locations,
      - then you can decide how to direct the camera in these scenes 
        - to acheive the composition effects you want
  - would buildings be reused for film?
    - once an iconic, recognizable location has been used in a popular, acclaimed film 
      - this would seem to reduce the incentive for the location to be reused again, at least for some time
      - however, at the same time, if a location has proven its worth,
        - then it seems the location could be reused again

  - so it seems, to some extent, the design of buildings in LA would reflect this need
    - e.g. there's a skating rink in LA that's used for most shots of skating in film over the past few years
      - besides it's location, what makes this rink a good location for film?
      - are there some buildings like this which were designed with image composition in mind?
        - at least, to some extent.  it'd be ridiculous to solely design a building around this.
    - but i wonder to what extent people design floor plans with this in mind?
      - do people study floor plans and schematics of buildings used for critically acclaimed films?

  - and, because limitations seem to enhance creativity, 
    - it seems this problem of designing the composition for shots would be more difficult for pixar
      - designing a scene for computer generated movies would require adding in lots of details
        - changes would be expensive in terms of time
      - so when these computer generated scenes are designed,
        - these general image compositions rules are likely taken into account early on
          - and the shots are designed around rough sketches
        - therefore, image composition is likely used more often in computer generated movies

  - how do these rules change for 3D movies? 
    - for 3D movies, you can control the perspective and viewing frustum at render time
      - this means it's easier to use these effects to accentuate things happening on screen
  - how do they change for VR?
    - how do you create these effects in VR "experiences" if you can't control the perspective of the viewer?
    - what is the equivalent of streaming video in VR?
  - how does this added complexity for a medium of the future affect it's adoption & it's rate of adoption?
    - because of the overwhelming complexity of the medium, 
      - does this limit the capacity of art in the VR medium to convey a consistent message to viewers?
      - or does the complexity only seem overwhelming bc i'm tightly coupling 360 VR video to film
        - and artist will have to explore to discover new forms of expression and new templating techniques,
    - this is similar to the differences between photography and cinematography (and between theatre and film)
      - whereas photography is fixed in time and lacks motion, cinematagraphy needs to take these into account
        - photography does depend on motion, to a degree, 
          - but with cinematagraphy, motion represents an entire dimension
      - so, with 360 VR experiences, the perspective of the viewer and their capacity to move from a fixed position
        - both represent added dimensions of the medium.
    - and so, similar to Alfred Hitchcock's quote that a subjects size on screen should reflect it's importance
      - a subject's positioning in VR medium should also reflect it's importance.
        - yet, it's a bit tougher to control that, so i should disect alfred hitchcock's statement there
    - why is it that size on screen should reflect importance? 
      - to understand this, we need to understand what draws a viewer's attention
      - there's something almost mathematic about this
        - what the director is really trying to control is the probability distribution 
          - of where people are looking during certain key frames in a scene
        - this is so that they can direct the viewer's experience
      - so, if by increasing the size of a subject, 
        - you increase the probability that someone happens to look at that subject
          - then it makes it easier to expect that someone is observing the right things
            - to have the kind of experience you intended
    - so, how does this change for VR? how can you attempt to control the probability distribution here?
      - if a viewer can turn and look anywhere they want, or even shift position,
        - how can you guarantee that a good chunk of your viewers 
          - are going to experience the right thing at the right time?
          - (hint) 3D audio helps alot, but still isn't enough
    - i think that this added complexity will either: 
      - hold back the medium from widespread adoption
      - or force artists to be creative in finding a way to transcend past this limitation
        - which is ironically a limitation created by a lack of limitation
      - so, for example, instead of creating an experience like a film, which is exactly the same every time
        - artists may opt to create a cross between a film and a video game
          - where the experience is event-driven and the characters respond to the viewer's state
            - while being coded to provide as consistent of an experience as possible
  - VR x Theater?!

- man should prove himself wise enough to preserve nature as it is before attempting to alter it

- article on dark matter, gravity and relativity
  - specifically, is the speed of light truly constant for all conditions
    - light is composed of particle waves flowing through space
      - if space curves, light appears to curve, but the flow of light doesn't affect the medium
        - for the most part, the mass of energy flowing through space as photons
          - doesn't affect the structure of space.
      - however, if light is flowing in sync with a gravity wave,
        - the gravity wave [supposedly] flows at the speed of light
          - but distorts the structure of spacetime itself as it propagates
        - therefore it would alter the apparent speed of light flowing in the same direction
        - possibly(??) causing that light to *appear* to travel 
          - at slightly less/slightly more than c
   - if this is true, or if something similar is true, and c is not universally constant
     - but instead c varies from apparent c, dependent on the structure of space,
     - then what is c, really?
     - and how does this affect other laws of physics?
       - which are dependent on c? are they actually dependent on local/apparent c?
     - and how does this affect the conclusions we've reached using statistic modeling of the cosmos?
   - it's probably not tru to begin with (i don't knwo all the mathematic complexities)
     - however, it's interesting to thing that something so fundamental as the constant nature of c
       - may not be so constant
     - and it's an interesting thought experiment to examine the dependencies of theories in physics
       - if X, changes how does that affect theories based on X?  etc..

- ancient people's knowledge was far more advanced than we give them credit for

## Math

- universiality of math should be evident in th progresson of alien computing technology.
  - computers are physical manifestations of certain kinds of math
  - aliens, at least terrans, should similarly progress through materials and computing technologies
  - likely had similar processor architectures and similar distinctions between computer languages (alien lisp)
  - aliens need to solve many of the same problems we do for technology
    - so they likely need to have very similar experiments to do so
    - and they make many of the same breakthroughs in a simliar progression
  - aliens then observing us would understand the problems we are facing
    - and those we are about to face
  - there would be many differences though, based on:
    - availability of resources, form/function of species and speciation
    - defining qualities of environment and the form of intelligent life
    - specific progression of technology
    - cataclysmic events 

- measuring the degree to which inner/outer neural networks
  - are disrupted by variations in input and correlate this to the performance of the network

  - you can more easily see similarities between things
  - new problems and technologies are simply a reformulation of old ideas
- spatial breakdown of pop-n-lock dance moves

## Technology

- how the shift to VR/AR changes the tech economic landscape 
  - less need for traditional user-interfacing hardware
  - more need for software/networking/wearables/micro-computer
  - wearables will set fashion trends, as the most popular & most functional will set the tone for form/function
  - very little need for monitors
  - this is all very dependent on battery power
- why we need to get as many people to understand technology as possible
  - bc the next may be the last generation that has a **need** to learn about technology
  - therefore, if it's a threat we need to have as many people as possible who understand it
  - and why preparing for technology in this way will accelerate it's development
- defending yourself against an Omniscient/Omnipotent adversary

- New theory of gravity, dark matter, "ether" and no big bang: http://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html
  - gravity is an illusion, like the centripital force, space is linked to matter, matter affects space, space affects the space around it, like a fluid.  the ether is real.
  - if the universe is 13.7 billion years old and we're not in the center of it, then there should be some space beyond which we see nothing.  if not, the big bang can't be true.

- the commonality of the human condition drives humanity's desire to improve it (rewrite)
  - that is, because we all understand the effects of negative/positive events in our own life
    - as well as their effects on the lives of those around us
    - we become conditioned with the desire to overcome it
  - when people witness or become aware of extremely unfair events
    - the human condition drives our desire to correct them
    - if someone has utilized unfair tactics to target someone's friends
      - then if those people become aware of these injustice's
      - they will be capable of empathizing with the strife and they will strive for justice
      - even if this means taking on some pain themselves
  - this can be harnessed to correct social injustice on a large scale
    - through non-violent intervention, such as that employed by Ghandi and Dr. King
    - at first, people like Ghandi and Dr. King were begged by their friends to just fall in line
      - to accept that which was unfair because it was "good enough" or "it could be worse"
    - but by getting attention with the right means 
      - and drawing the people around them into the fight 
        - who must be willing to accept pain in striving towards a better condition for everyone
      - these hero's were able to draw even more attention to injustices
    - and this is because, when people are presented with the right information from the right perspective,
      - they will almost always make the right decision
      - they will struggle for justice or change, even to their own detriment
  - this insurmountable desire for equinimity, justice and truth often lays dormant
    - but it can be tapped through the just the right push
    - and it is driven by the human condition
      - that is, the common experiences that we all face throughout our lives
      - 

- exploiting buridan's principle
  - buridan's is pretty fucked up if you think about it
  - explain the original aristotolean version
    - food & water, man's halfway between both.  but he STARVES every time.
      - this is because he will choose what he thinks he needs most: the water
    - eventually, this was "simplified" to having two identical objects: bales of hay
      - this sorta simplifies it, but also greatly changes the meaning
      - and it was changed by buridan to having an the "ass" representing a simpleton.
  - buridans is great because it exemplifies problems in our own systems of ethics
    - and exemplifies how knowledge of someone's system of ethics or belief systems can be used to stagnate that person
      - wow, that's really, really, fucking depressing
    - so, if it can be used for controlling people through their belief systems, 
      - then it also speaks on the value of more-uniform belief systems
      - that is, if everyone has mostly random belief systems composed of a myriad of parent belief systems
        - then they are going to be a bit harder to systematically motivate
      - if the ability to systematically motivate people is valuable for whatever reasons (for evil or for good!)
        - then this speaks volumes on the value of systems for instilling similar belief & values systems
          - i.e. RELIGION
        - furthermore, if this ability to motivate others in this way is valuable and can be used for good or evil
          - then it must be guarded, so that it is available for good
      - systems of mass control are crucial for motivating people to pursue behavior
        - where the end goal of the behavior is moreso and indirect goal of their behavior
          - and perhaps the people participating in this behavior are not aware of the end goal of it at all
      - as evil as a system of mass control might sound, perhaps things like this aren't so bad
        - there are forces of evil at play in the world which can't be fought directly
        - by the way, this is where aristotle's politics and rhetoric come in to play
          - though i haven't read either, i'm just surmising from the themes of his Politics
          - it seems politics is a book about pursuing actions which obliquely support your group's agenda
      - ... phew i think i went a bit off topic there.
  - buridans variations - buridans awesome because you can easily variate it.
    - bales A & B.  ass equally distant.  ass already has bale C, you take bale C
    - one bale of hay is real and the other is fake, but the ass doesn't know which.  
      - or doesn't know that one could be fake
    - buridan's + game theory.  
      - example where two people are walking towards each other and need to decide who's going to move out of the way
    - or two planes flying towards each other and need to coordinate an action with limited time for communication
      - an action, where if they make a symmetric decision, will result in disaster
  - write about why it's important to make decisions ahead of time 
    - and distribute decision making protocols ahead of time
    - this is important for distributed computer systems, 
      - but also for people who may not be able to communicate efficiently, openly, etc
        - when needed to make a decision
    - there's a connection to category theory and monads here
    - is it possible for someone to innately contain all of this information
      - in otherwords , they have pre-decided on how to resolve every *kind* of decision they'll ever make
      - basically the ass has apriori knwoledge of every decision it will have to make
        - or at least every *kind* of decision
      - and isn't this what religion instills us with
        - early on, by studying religion, we equip ourselves with knowledge about situations
          - situations we haven't personally encountered and kinds of decisions we haven't made
        - this comes at the cost of freedom of choosing our own path and our own belief system
          - but it's just fucking useful to not have to expend the time and effort 
            - to decide on every detail

  - how occult societies psychologically filter initiates and why
  - magick as a means to transfer knowledge secretly and meta-magick as setting up channels of communication
  - category theory
- magick and computer algorithms
  - raft consensus algorithm

## Education

- Centralizing and utilizing educational resources to accelerate K12 education, while maintaining the ability to experiment
- Removing math as a separate subject and teaching math through application
- how students learn math through the arts (applied category theory)

## Health/Biology

- Novel(?) problems in genetic modifications (altered gene expression results in propagation of epigenetic information to subsequent generations)
- Your body establishes patterns of gene expression during youth.  These patterns become difficult to change in adulthood
- the paradigm shift of epigenetics and it's philosophical implications: 
  - http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150402161751.htm
  - http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-genome-s-spirals-loops-and-globules-come-into-4-d-view-video/
- DNA as a probabilistic program
  - differentiation of genomic programs and cell-types should be relatively flat
  - that is, there's a tree that represents the types of cells that cells can become
  - but, because of occam's razor, this tree should be flat because too much hierarchy induces too much complexity in the system
- why you should cycle nootropics and nutritional supplements
  - some vitamins/minerals competitively inhibit absorption of others
  - nootropics and herbs taken consistently for long enough time periods cause your body/brain to adjust

## UI & HCI

- Augmented Reality
- Tools to block access to FB

## Psychology

- application of ideas from machine learning to psychology, learning, etc.
- the situation i went through in westminister colorado, where i had to call the cops on someone i just met
- therapy for social situations.  a small group of people write dialogue for a TV show.  encourages people to think deeper behind what makes people tick in social situations.
- antidepressants, inhibited sexuality and dirty porn
- sociology: "clearing the path" - metaphor for prepping social situations for someone/some event 
- how it might feel to be terminally ill
- how inundation of text (via mobile apps) and surveillance has magically changed how people perceive text and interact online 

## Surveillance State

- tactics for avoiding surveillance
- why surveillance is worse in virtual reality
- what people don't understand about machine learning
- the drug war as introduction to totalitarianism
- censorship on facebook
- app to fuzz data to social accounts to prevent pattern recognition
- #‎USB‬ ‪#‎TypeC‬ as your only option for a power supply is the most ‪#‎Orwellian‬ thing i've ever seen. I give up. Show's over folks. The American Dream is over. Privacy? 
- VR Manakin projects.  Implanted memories using virtual reality.
- avoiding surveillance by painting a picture online with the abundance of data
  - why this is better than simply dropping out of online activity altogether

## Government

- why communism is bullshit and is its own antithesis
  - why north korea isn't communinist (it's autocratic/military/monarchy) and why N.K. should be a synonym for full of shit
  - north koreans obviously aren't allowed to study government.  otherwise, they would know exactly how oxymoronic and [synonym for word-missing-the-meaning] they are
  - why i slightly respect chinese communism (but why it's not exactly communism)
  - what's required for communism to work and why this inherantly plants the seeds of its own destruction 
    - the agencies required for surveillance gain the power and motivation for more power
    - I.E. the KGB subverting communism into oligarchy to magnify their own power.

## History

- why the Norwegian crusade was a badass medieval crusade
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Crusade
- the ancient geography of the mediteranean would have radically shifted political/economic centers of power
  - NOAA bathymetry map: https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/
  - gawker article on underwater sicilian megaliths http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X15300535
  - look for conjunction of < 100m depth and extended river pathways.  
  - identify altered currents and smooth waters.
  - doggerland
    - where was the water?  what parts of the english channel/north sea show the most glacial activity?
    - compare celtic megalithic culture & sites with river locations.  
      - english channel river system
    - why did cultures disperse to western england and eastern denmark?
      - probably because tsunami destroyed most of doggerland in 6,000 bc
      - which could account for the lack of megalithic culture in that region
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland
    - persion gulf flooded
  - flooding islands as impetus to develop seafaring technology.
    - large islands created around 12000BC, ever dwindling resources and expanding population
    - pushes people to develop seafaring boats to escape .. or not

## Religion

- why there will never be another world religion based on the acts of one man

## Politics

- Why TPP doesn't even make sense
- How I boycotted oil for two years
- China's plan to rule the world:
  - loan us tons of money
  - sell us shitty shit that breaks in 2 years
  - we'll spend all our money on stuff yet need to continue buying more.  remember, this is money that we've borrowed from china, yet we're giving it all back to them.  they get the money back that we borrowed, but we still owe trillions in debt.
  - meanwhile, they're pillaging all our industrial & military secrets through espionage and cyberwarfare. remember, we invested billions in researching these technologies, using the funds we borrowed from china.  we did all the hard work, yet they steal our technology.
  - build up tons of industrial infrustructure to produce these goods that america buys, while american industrial infrastructure rots.
  - ????
  - profit
- diversity & entropy
  - using entropy as a tool to mak observations about diversity
