- open sourced my brain:
  - hacker news post

blog on why i don't drive
- as protest
- because of barrier to entry

blog on skiima-cohort-report
- convert to an example project for skiima
- blog about it.  convert it to a rails project?
- also set up an example rails project for skiima, showing a dashboard
  and etc
coding for the muse device
- how i got it working
  - check forum post & update
- why i had to recreate the project over and over again
  - review git commits (then consolidate, so messages are gone)
- problems:
  - file structure issues
  - needed to add "-lc++" to "OTHER_LDFLAGS"
  - obscure errors when accessing IXNMuseManager with the API (everything else worked alright)
    - but the net effect was: i had to wall off access to the lib within objective-c which kinda sucked
    - i have practically zero experience with objective-c and also, my design was overly complicated

compare 21st century america to fall of rome as warning
- compare prescription medication to lead in aqueducts
  - also, we literally have lead in water

blogs on swift:
- dependency injection with Swinject. problems implementing auto-injection.
  - explain some ideas for funcitonal programming,
    - especially those combining category theory and combinatory logic
- using reflection for metaprogramming
- functional programming paradigms.  (category theory implemented in swift? Inversion-of-Control)
- modeling problems with functional programming techniques (way different than OOP)

Need for a tech-oriented language:
- one language w/ 16 or 32 chars (hex)
  - very useful in minimizing search time
- another kanji-like language
  - sym for each concept
  - isomorphic to words
  - analysis of semantics and languages in hex to produce the primitive radicals from 'first principles'
- these concepts could be universal (fucking space aliens)
- identifying the chars themselves could be a universal process
  - by making not of simple mathematic properties (particularly various kinds of symmetries)
    - and using symbols that are rotationally and symmetrically invariant
  - another pattern may be that the number of strokes for the 16-32 char lang is equivalent to the base
    - 0/1 have 1 stroke 2/3 have 2 strokes, 4567 have 3 strokes, etc.
- but the point is that there is or may be
  - a pair of universal written language forms that map to universal semantics
- that is, each sufficiently advanced race would invariably produce the same communication forms/protocols
  - and one primary advantage to this is that it would aid communication limitations imposed by speed of light
    - that is, if there were some triple of communication protocol, symbols and semantics
      - which was based on something so universal that it transcended space & time
    - then, each culture in the galaxy or universe that became sufficiently advanced would develop this
      - at least until that culture developed technology which transcended the limits of the speed of light
      - there may be a period of 10,000 to millions of years before a civilization truly transcends it
        - as the means of surpassing the speed of light and imposition of the vastness of space
          - may be very very very expensive in terms of energy
        - and thus there may be some kind of galactic ethics issues involved as well
          - who's energy is it to harvest, really
    - anyways, my point is, if the speed of light really is an issue, then a universal language would be
      - very very useful in helping alien species communicate from across the galaxy
        - esp. when the time scales of communication response might be upwards of 100,000 years
        - or millions of years in trans-galactic communication
- so, whats the basis of such a language?  math!  the "universal language"
  - the language would be based on mathmatic primitives from category theory, algebraic geometry, etc
  - and these primitives would be combined in some "universal" way to produce semantics at a higher level
- furthermore, at the exact time in which a species in the galaxy is obtaining tech for outer space exploration
  - is the exact time in which we are obtaining the tech for inner space exploration (i.e. computers, cyberspace)
  - and it is clearly demonstratable there are algorithmic benefits to placing constraints on language
    - especially if it is to be a true esparanto or a truly universal language
  - for example, constraining a language to use a base-2 number of symbols maximizes information throughput
    - this, in turn, maximizes the output of some bitcrunching versions of those algorithms
      - quantum computing is good for some things, but it doesn't really accelerate indexing algorithms AFAIK
        - that is, if you're talking about quantum computing as in quantum simulation of statistics functions
        - if instead, you mean quantum computing as increasing the number of bits available for simultaneous processing
          - then ... maybe those bitcruncing algs would be different.
          - but i'm pretty sure these versions of quantum computing are really fucking hard
            - that is, encoding 2 bits of state with each electron - e.g. (overly-simplistic) one with charge and one with spin
            - these are very difficult to design and very difficult to spatially optimize (reduce in size)
          - this is not the same thing as quantum computing as it's usually discussed (that is, as it's employed for Shor's algs)
            - but it would accelerate traditional computing
        - but quantum computing which is employed for shor's algs
          - and uses entanglement or other mechanisms to link operations as they proceed thru the processor
          - this doesn't really aid some of the most basic indexing algorithms for text
            - or for genomics, which is what led me to discovering this universal language phenomena
    - my point is that, the combination of
      - (1) algorithmic benefits and
      - (2) the ensuing insight of a truly universal language
      - therefore, may converge to produce the phenomena of a universal language
        - that is, there is both the need (#1 above) and the comprehension of the possibility & benefits (#2)
          - and these two things converge at approximately the same time in the development of a sufficiently advanced civilization.
- boom.

      - ... there is something more here?
  - tabula rasa, zen and the art of beginning
    - it's important to observe yourself as you know knothing
      - but how can you know to do this or know how to do this
        - if you most crucially need to observe yourself as you know nothing?
      - how does one instill the art of observing the right things in themselves if they know nothing?
    - these are classic problems that have been poured over and meditated on for millenia
      - particularly the zen thing i just mentioned,

  - which brings me to my next point
    - everything that has been done has been done countless times before
      - [lead into examples? or fully develop thoughts first]
      - ancient math was developed that acted as the basis for ancient philosophic logic & thought
        - Banach–Tarski paradox is incredibly important and i believe developed in ancient times
          - i cannot recall what it is crucially important in philosophy
          - this is completely baseless by the way.

radial aspects of pulsar and planetary discovery?
- if we've detected X planets, an`d we know that only planets who's orbit crosses
  - within the diameter can be discovered,
  - how would one construct a statistical method that tells us how many to expect
  - the statistic would also have to account for the likelyhood of planet orbit and planet disk formation
    - to align with the rotation of the galaxy
- for pulsars the same thing is relevant for universal navigation systems.
  - in other words, using pulsars to pinpoint universal location works,
    - but we can only see the pulsars that are lined up with us
    - this works for galactic navigation and even for local super group navigation
  - but it doesn't work if you were in another corner of the universe (several million lightyears away)
    - you'll see a subset of pulsars that wee see, which is lined up in a cylindar that extends infinitely
      in the direction of point a and point b
  - also, how to you communicate the map off pulsars across such vast distance as thousands of light years
- how can we know how locations millions of light years away see the universe?
  - would doing so break our model of the universe?

  - affect language and the development of the brain?
  - what subtle differences are caused by languages that have cataphoric inflexion of grammer
    - versus those who have pronouncedly less.
  - by cataphoric inflexion, i mean your brain constantly has to think a little ahead
    - if i'm asking a question "how do[es] ... "
      - i have to subconsciously think about the subject before rendering the ve
        - does the verb need to be inflected plural or singular?
        - it depends on the subject of course
      - i only have thought about this because of subtle neurological symptoms
    - this is also true for lots of other grammitic subtleties in many languages
      - but pronouncedly moreso in indo-european languages
        - especially in those languages that differentiate on gender
      - and pronouncedly less so in languages like japanese and mandarin
        - they do not have the same problem because they usually avoid gender altogether
          - and usually pluralization, too.  unless the plurality is specified.
  - so what are the effects on native speakers in expression and on cognitive patterns?

- hypothetical /net/null attacks:
  - far too easy to hijack/manipulate unencrypted network connections using routing protocol attacks
  - e.g. reroute unencrypted IRC messages, then balance out the packets for that app
    - so that to the client, it appears that messages have been sent
      - that is, ACK packets are received
    - but no one actually sees those messages
  - called /net/null because it's similar to sending output to /dev/null
  - an attack like this would be fairly easy to identify,
    - but only if someone knew what to look for

- specialized hardware capabilities (esp. CPU/GPU architecture) augment VR, but at the same time, threaten it's market viability
  - talk about divergent hardware threatening the viability of VR devices by making it far too complicated for consumers

    - the tech may face a setback of years
- differences in learning CS through academics and through experience
  - why CS is all about
    - without consciously understanding the math behind cs

    - they see the same problem everywhere and believe that every problem that fits a mold/patterm has the same answer
    - when in fact, there are some problems/algorithms which can be made more efficient than it appears at first glance
      - and it is precisely because of the subtleties of the domain of the problem.

- ancient people's knowledge was far more advanced than we give them credit for
  - quite often, a system observed with less information is more simply understood than when perceiving the same system with much more info.
  - this phenomenon results in modern man's misapprehension that our supposedly more acute vision of reality offers more complete comprehension
  - check snippet on how ancient people could have anticipated something like the internet

    - how long would it take for them to regognize each further fraction of a leap year
      - how would they explain this?

  - ancient people's fascination with stars,
    - as they were the most dependable, most stable phenomenon of their world

## Math

- universiality of math should be evident in th progresson of alien computing technology.
  - computers are physical manifestations of certain kinds of math
  - aliens, at least terrans, should similarly progress through materials and computing technologies
  - likely had similar processor architectures and similar distinctions between computer languages (alien lisp)
  - aliens need to solve many of the same problems we do for technology
    - so they likely need to have very similar experiments to do so
    - and they make many of the same breakthroughs in a simliar progression
  - aliens then observing us would understand the problems we are facing
    - and those we are about to face
  - there would be many differences though, based on:
    - availability of resources, form/function of species and speciation
    - defining qualities of environment and the form of intelligent life
    - specific progression of technology
    - cataclysmic events

- measuring the degree to which inner/outer neural networks
  - are disrupted by variations in input and correlate this to the performance of the network
  - using this as an important meta-measure of how well these certain phenomena are captured by the network
  - an example of something that maybe should not be published

  - humans recognize objects in 4D, not 3D
- knowledge of higher-order math allows people to compress information and learn faster
  - especially for knowledge related to data manipulation, networks, api's, programming languages, etc.
  - you can more easily see similarities between things
  - new problems and technologies are simply a reformulation of old ideas
- spatial breakdown of pop-n-lock dance moves

## Technology

- how the shift to VR/AR changes the tech economic landscape
  - less need for traditional user-interfacing hardware
  - more need for software/networking/wearables/micro-computer
  - wearables will set fashion trends, as the most popular & most functional will set the tone for form/function
  - very little need for monitors
  - this is all very dependent on battery power
- why we need to get as many people to understand technology as possible
  - bc the next may be the last generation that has a **need** to learn about technology
  - therefore, if it's a threat we need to have as many people as possible who understand it
  - and why preparing for technology in this way will accelerate it's development
- defending yourself against an Omniscient/Omnipotent adversary
  - like say, a rogue department of an intelligence agency or the inevitable nemisis of AI
- how the singularity and surveillance will promote occult techniques
  - why this is good and bad

## Science

- Climate Change, Drought and Famine
  - glaciers and mountainous regions as batteries of water.
  - depleting them leads to acquifers that don't get replentished.  eventually drought and famine.
- New theory of gravity, dark matter, "ether" and no big bang: http://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html
  - gravity is an illusion, like the centripital force, space is linked to matter, matter affects space, space affects the space around it, like a fluid.  the ether is real.
  - if the universe is 13.7 billion years old and we're not in the center of it, then there should be some space beyond which we see nothing.  if not, the big bang can't be true.
- relate hallucinogens with google's dreaming neural networks

## Physics

- Quantum Gravity & Doubly Special Relativity
  - instead of being based on Position Space
  - it is based on "Momentum Space," which is similar to a vague aha moment I had
    - where i felt that, for some reason, the curvature of space would have something to do with momentum
      - if some kind of invariance were to be preserved between 3+ observers
        - (i think this was the line of thought i was following)
- can we actually pinpoint the source location for gravitational waves?
  - the difference here will tell us a lot about the universe
  - i don't think that gravity follows the same path as light
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves#Location_in_the_sky
    - admits they are using conventional methods to track gravitational waves
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Strong_field_tests:_Binary_pulsars
- how does gravity exert force on other objects, in respect to it's speed for travel
  - gravitational doppershift?
    - a relativity like theory is needed to specify how change in speed changes expression of gravity.
    - there should be a way to deduce true locations of objects by observing their estimated position
      - in relation to the estimated position of massive objects moving towards/away from them at high speeds
    - at high speeds, there should be some difference in the momentums of each object
      - that existing theories don't predict
    - the ideal situation is an object moving perpendicular to the motion of a very large object moving quickly toward it. existing frameworks should have difficulting predicting the motion of this smaller object
  - this is because the objects are not pulling on each other, they are distorting space
    - this distortion travels at a speed and has fluid-like properties
- the fluidlike nature of space should cause some changes in the behavior of spacetime
  - for large, fast moving objects.  gravity should be greater ahead of them and lesser behind their path.
  - however, the fluidlike nature will create higher level, observable phenomena
    - visible from the propagation of gravity from the object
- the total effect of an object on the spacetime around it should be equal, regardless of its motion
  - (for some reason, i really think i was going somewhere with this idea, but i didn't capture it)
    - acceleration changes the way gravity is expressed?
    - density changes the way gravity is expressed?
      - how does each component's pull on each other affect the total pull on an observer?
  - unless of course, its mass changes.
  - as the changes in space curvature radiate out, the amount of pull that is radiating out
    - should sum up to an equivalent amount
      - would the density of the object affect this amount?
        - it should.  the counteracting forces of mass that pulls against itself
          - should mean the object has less pull on space around it, with respect to the mass of the object
          - or, when divided up into infinite peices, can one say that the components to the curvature of space
            around an object always counteract each other in the same way?
            - no, but yes (maybe)
            - this is because the components of an object pull against each other with 1000 times the strength
              when the object is 1000 times denser (relationship is not truly linear)
      - that is, for a large oject, like the sun or earth,
        - do the gravitational forces counteracting each other detract from the total gravitational force?
      - this is beside the point
  - if the object is constant, the oval of distorted space around it doesn't change shape
    - if the object accelerates, that oval-shaped field does change shape.
      - ahead of the object, the space experiences a denser pull towards the object
        - but over time, it averages out to be the same (with respect to the object's changed position)
      - behind the object, the space experiences a lighter pull towards the object
  - but the point is, the total 'amount' of curvature in space around the object remains the same
    - as does the total 'amount' / time in curvature in space around the object
- the problem with testing many of these theorys is that we can only make large scale observations for gravity
- is the gravity at the center of earth truly "Zero"?
  - that is, the space at the center of a massive object would have some effect from the mass of the earth
- thought experiment: comet at the 99% speed of light, heading inwards on it's orbit around the son
  - if it's riding at nearly the speed of light, how does it experience changes in the force of gravity
    - what about 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%
- another thought experiment: an innumerable number of grands of sand in space, with the total mass of one sun
  - but the are spread out to be a sphere the volume of the solar system
  - now place a feather at any point around the sphere of equally dense sand
    - for different points inside and out, how does the feature experience gravity & space
    - for different densities of the sphere?
  - can this be used to construct a space-displacement theory of gravity?
    - and with space displacement, there should be vortexes formed by an object's motion/acceleration

- the commonality of the human condition drives humanity's desire to improve it (rewrite)
  - that is, because we all understand the effects of negative/positive events in our own life
    - as well as their effects on the lives of those around us
    - we become conditioned with the desire to overcome it
  - when people witness or become aware of extremely unfair events
    - the human condition drives our desire to correct them
    - if someone has utilized unfair tactics to target someone's friends
      - then if those people become aware of these injustice's
      - they will be capable of empathizing with the strife and they will strive for justice
      - even if this means taking on some pain themselves
  - this can be harnessed to correct social injustice on a large scale
    - through non-violent intervention, such as that employed by Ghandi and Dr. King
    - at first, people like Ghandi and Dr. King were begged by their friends to just fall in line
      - to accept that which was unfair because it was "good enough" or "it could be worse"
    - but by getting attention with the right means
      - and drawing the people around them into the fight
        - who must be willing to accept pain in striving towards a better condition for everyone
      - these hero's were able to draw even more attention to injustices
    - and this is because, when people are presented with the right information from the right perspective,
      - they will almost always make the right decision
      - they will struggle for justice or change, even to their own detriment
  - this insurmountable desire for equinimity, justice and truth often lays dormant
    - but it can be tapped through the just the right push
    - and it is driven by the human condition
      - that is, the common experiences that we all face throughout our lives

- exploiting buridan's principle
  - buridan's is pretty fucked up if you think about it
  - explain the original aristotolean version
    - food & water, man's halfway between both.  but he STARVES every time.
      - this is because he will choose what he thinks he needs most: the water
    - eventually, this was "simplified" to having two identical objects: bales of hay
      - this sorta simplifies it, but also greatly changes the meaning
      - and it was changed by buridan to having an the "ass" representing a simpleton.
  - buridans is great because it exemplifies problems in our own systems of ethics
    - and exemplifies how knowledge of someone's system of ethics or belief systems can be used to stagnate that person
      - wow, that's really, really, fucking depressing
    - so, if it can be used for controlling people through their belief sy
      - then it also speaks on the value of more-uniform belief systems
      - that is, if everyone has mostly random belief systems composed of a myriad of parent belief systems
        - then they are going to be a bit harder to systematically motivate
      - if the ability to systematically motivate people is valuable for whatever reasons (for evil or for good!)
        - then this speaks volumes on the value of systems for instilling similar belief & values systems
          - i.e. RELIGION
        - furthermore, if this ability to motivate others in this way is valuable and can be used for good or evil
          - then it must be guarded, so that it is available for good
      - systems of mass control are crucial for motivating people to pursue behavior
        - where the end goal of the behavior is moreso and indirect goal of their behavior
          - and perhaps the people participating in this behavior are not aware of the end goal of it at all
      - as evil as a system of mass control might sound, perhaps things like this aren't so bad
        - there are forces of evil at play in the world which can't be fought directly
        - by the way, this is where aristotle's politics and rhetoric come in to play
          - though i haven't read either, i'm just surmising from the themes of his Politics
          - it seems politics is a book about pursuing actions which obliquely support your group's agenda
      - ... phew i think i went a bit off topic there.
  - buridans variations - buridans awesome because you can easily variate it.
    - bales A & B.  ass equally distant.  ass already has bale C, you take bale C
    - one bale of hay is real and the other is fake, but the ass doesn't know which.
      - or doesn't know that one could be fake
    - buridan's + game theory.
      - example where two people are walking towards each other and need to decide who's going to move out of the way
    - or two planes flying towards each other and need to coordinate an action with limited time for communication
      - an action, where if they make a symmetric decision, will result in disaster
  - write about why it's important to make decisions ahead of time
    - and distribute decision making protocols ahead of time
    - this is important for distributed computer systems,
      - but also for people who may not be able to communicate efficiently, openly, etc
        - when needed to make a decision
    - there's a connection to category theory and monads here
    - is it possible for someone to innately contain all of this information
      - in otherwords , they have pre-decided on how to resolve every *kind* of decision they'll ever make
      - basically the ass has apriori knwoledge of every decision it will have to make
        - or at least every *kind* of decision
      - and isn't this what religion instills us with
        - early on, by studying religion, we equip ourselves with knowledge about situations
          - situations we haven't personally encountered and kinds of decisions we haven't made
        - this comes at the cost of freedom of choosing our own path and our own belief system
          - but it's just fucking useful to not have to expend the ti
            - to decide on every detail

## Esotericism

- how occult techniques work
  - how they hack the algorithms of the brain's neural network to redirect/focus a person's thoughts
  - how occult societies psychologically filter initiates and why
  - magick as a means to transfer knowledge secretly and meta-magick as setting up channels of communication
  - category theory
- magick and computer algorithms
  - raft consensus algorithm

## Education

- Centralizing and utilizing educational resources to accelerate K12 education, while maintaining the ability to experiment
- Removing math as a separate subject and teaching math through application
- how students learn math through the arts (applied category theory)

## Health/Biology

- Novel(?) problems in genetic modifications (altered gene expression results in propagation of epigenetic information to subsequent generations)
- Your body establishes patterns of gene expression during youth.  These patterns become difficult to change in adulthood
- the paradigm shift of epigenetics and it's philosophical implications:
  - http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150402161751.htm
  - http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-genome-s-spirals-loops-and-globules-come-into-4-d-view-video/
- DNA as a probabilistic program
  - differentiation of genomic programs and cell-types should be relatively flat
  - that is, there's a tree that represents the types of cells that cells can become
  - but, because of occam's razor, this tree should be flat because too much hierarchy induces too much complexity in the system
- "Improved MRI Scanning Techniques" (they already exist)
  - [Magnetization Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetization_transfer) + machine learning to recognize characteristic neuronal features
  - could this be combined with DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) methodology or models to help detail a functional map of the brain
  - do higher order patterns emerge in the resonance of hydrogen molecules around similar/disparate macromolecules?
    - if so, would these be detectable?  or does Magnetization Transfer already utilize the limits of what's possible here
    - higher order patterns may only emerge around specific cell types
    - is 3.0T MRI even strong enough to do anything here?
  - can ion-interactions be utilized to infer more information?  particularly Sodium 23, as it's one of the primary neuro-ions
  - what can Magnetization Transfer tell us about ion-channels in the brain?
    - if Magnetization Transfer is all about how free ions react to the presence of a strong magnetic
  - can heavy water be used as a contrast agent?  (yes, it can - [Patent (2013)](https://www.google.com/patents/US20130142724)
    - furthermore, can heavy water be combined with MT? (would need before and after shots)
      - this would be particularly effective in the presence of contrasting agents!  ... maybe

- why you should cycle nootropics and nutritional supplements
  - some vitamins/minerals competitively inhibit absorption of others
  - nootropics and herbs taken consistently for long enough time periods cause your body/brain to adjust
  - this is also true of some medications
    - by studying how brain chemistry is altered and how genetic programs respond to various medications
      - quickly cycling medications *may in some cases* allow the brain to reach a stable point
      - at this point, some med cycling could be halted and the brain -- with a consistent diet --
        - may acheive stability that it could not either with consistent medication or without medicantion
  - identifying patterns of responses to various brain chemistries and especially by identifying genetic and dietary effect
    - will be incredibly useful in properly treating mental illness

## UI & HCI

- Augmented Reality
- Tools to block access to FB

## Psychology

- application of ideas from machine learning to psychology, learning, etc.
- the situation i went through in westminister colorado, where i had to call the cops on someone i just met
- therapy for social situations.  a small group of people write dialogue for a TV show.  encourages people to think deeper behind what makes people tick in social situations.
- antidepressants, inhibited sexuality and dirty porn
- sociology: "clearing the path" - metaphor for prepping social situations for someone/some event
- how it might feel to be terminally ill
- how inundation of text (via mobile apps) and surveillance has magically changed how people perceive text and interact online

## Surveillance State

- tactics for avoiding surveillance
- why surveillance is worse in virtual reality
- what people don't understand about machine learning
- the drug war as introduction to totalitarianism
- censorship on facebook
- app to fuzz data to social accounts to prevent pattern recognition
- #‎USB‬ ‪#‎TypeC‬ as your only option for a power supply is the most ‪#‎Orwellian‬ thing i've ever seen. I give up. Show's over folks. The American Dream is over. Privacy?
- VR Manakin projects.  Implanted memories using virtual reality.
- avoiding surveillance by painting a picture online with the abundance of data
  - why this is better than simply dropping out of online activity altogether

## Government

- why communism is bullshit and is its own antithesis
  - why north korea isn't communinist (it's autocratic/military/monarchy) and why N.K. should be a synonym for full of shit
  - north koreans obviously aren't allowed to study government.  otherwise, they would know exactly how oxymoronic and [synonym for word-missing-the-meaning] they are
  - why i slightly respect chinese communism (but why it's not exactly communism)
  - what's required for communism to work and why this inherantly plants the seeds of its own destruction
    - the agencies required for surveillance gain the power and motivation for more power
    - I.E. the KGB subverting communism into oligarchy to magnify their own power.

## History

- why the Norwegian crusade was a badass medieval crusade
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Crusade
- the ancient geography of the mediteranean would have radically shifted political/economic centers of power
  - NOAA bathymetry map: https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/
  - gawker article on underwater sicilian megaliths http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X15300535
  - look for conjunction of < 100m depth and extended river pathways.
  - identify altered currents and smooth waters.
  - doggerland
    - where was the water?  what parts of the english channel/north sea show the most glacial activity?
    - compare celtic megalithic culture & sites with river locations.
      - english channel river system
    - why did cultures disperse to western england and eastern denmark?
      - probably because tsunami destroyed most of doggerland in 6,000 bc
      - which could account for the lack of megalithic culture in that region
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland
    - persion gulf flooded
  - flooding islands as impetus to develop seafaring technology.
    - large islands created around 12000BC, ever dwindling resources and expanding population
    - pushes people to develop seafaring boats to escape .. or not

## Religion

- why there will never be another world religion based on the acts of one man

## Politics

- Why TPP doesn't even make sense
- How I boycotted oil for two years
- China's plan to rule the world:
  - loan us tons of money
  - sell us shitty shit that breaks in 2 years
  - we'll spend all our money on stuff yet need to continue buying more.  remember, this is money that we've borrowed from china, yet we're giving it all back to them.  they get the money back that we borrowed, but we still owe trillions in debt.
  - meanwhile, they're pillaging all our industrial & military secrets through espionage and cyberwarfare. remember, we invested billions in researching these technologies, using the funds we borrowed from china.  we did all the hard work, yet they steal our technology.
  - build up tons of industrial infrustructure to produce these goods that america buys, while american industrial infrastructure rots.
  - ????
  - profit
- diversity & entropy
  - using entropy as a tool to mak observations about diversity
