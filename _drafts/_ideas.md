#### ML (X) A/V Lighting for Music

- tensor network for ML drumming styles applied to Ableton MIDI
  - the network that learns/recognizes/generates drumming styles or
    other instrument styles, what does it look like
- automate coordination for A/V (Lights, LED's etc)
  - but to inform/match the motions use the tensor network trained on
    the recognition of a musician's play styles for specific songs
  - needs to be able to analyze real-time audio to representations of
    musician/song/style/etc
  - the goal is to have a lighting show that runs itself, essentially
    - it recognizes the song that's being played and how many bars a
      solo/duet/etc is going on for.
    - it matches certain song regions or elements of play style to
      specific lighting transitions

#### Blockchain X Medium (see blockchain notes)

#### Backup/Analyze/Provide documentation for old electonics (& their components)

- app to backup/facilitate access to documentation for old appliance's
  electrical components & circuit diagrams
  - i'm sure there's already an app for that
  - this would be excellent with an app for recognizing gear with a
    3d/2d camera
    - it wouldn't just recognize the top-level product though, it
      could recognize the individual components and list the top-level
      VCR/DVD/etc product that the components were used in
  - an app like this would be most useful when paird with a community
    to foster reuse & recycling of antiquated gear
    - it would be useful to connect user's with suggested products to
      hack together with old VCR parts
      - kind of like suggested recipe's for individual ingredients
  - the challenge for this app would be building the community
    - it would be a bit of a challenge to break into the market
      because i'm sure there's already competition
    - so the challenge is to establish market share without running
      out of funding, so that all the appropriate pieces of the
      community can be built
- nanobrain-cloud to distributed timeshare service
  - essentially rent your brains computation power on demand (ok
    that's dumb lmao)

#### Logical Diffing of Federal USC Statutes to Produce Functionally Equivalent Documentation of Law

- parse USC federal & state law sections as "trees" to rebase the
  language so that it's functionally equivalent, but more simply
  expressed
  - rebase as in github, where you make the series of commits more
    simple. so, each bill passed through congress is like a "commit"
    in a git project. and they reference and merge in changes by
    referencing the law sections like an addressing scheme
    - but this is really complicated.
    - so it'd be useful to have software that parses this stuff
      semantically, so that the laws can be more simply understood and
      loopholes can be more easily identified.
  - an app like this would be very useful for people that are
    writing bills
    - you could have continuous integration and "automated testing"
      for congressional assistants to aid in writing bills

#### App: Train Stronger Rhyme Recognition/Generation via Neural Hack (semantic dissonance)

- present users with streams of non-sensical sentences that maintain a
  rhyme scheme. the statements don't make sense, but there is always a
  simple meter and a rhyme scheme.
  - the intention is that the semantic dissonance is jarring, which
    subconsciously compels the mind to focus a bit more on the rhymes
    it encounters
    - that is, it notices and picks up the intentional rhymes, but
      there is no valid semantic meaning of the sentence,
    - so it should force the mind to focus on the content its
      processing more, thus internalizing potential rhymes
  - ideally app would process voice allow for mutliple meters, but the
    content would be randomly generated

#### Misc Tech Ideas

- AR Meta Flashbards
- UI idea: tilt-to-reveal interaction for GIF's shared online


#### EEG Alarm Clock

- wakes you up in an ideal phase of sleep, before some specified time.
- allows you to collect data about your sleep patterns/etc

#### Oscil8 simplification:

  - a pastie dev site for configuring synth patches and sharing w/
    short-url, text & data
  - would include WebAudio MIDI interface
    - potentially emulation hardware/VST
  - simply a free tool for playing w/ Software/Web VST's and sharing
    the sounds in JSON (probably already exists)

- security idea: connect to un/secured video streams where the
  location of cameras is known: only in public places. those small
  cities and towns with primarily regional social flux will always
  exhibit lower identity flux, esp. new identities

===============


- singularity & delta-singularity can allow a group of people in power
  who control the development of technology, while restricting its
  penetration into society. this can allow them to trap the common man
  in a false paradigm, by imploding the system after collecting enough
  power with technology hidden from everyone else.

===============

- defeating the digitization of the mind: by disrupting the coherence
  of psychological/sociological information systems by rendering the
  following schematically inconsistent (i.e. incapable of embedding by
  unifying schema)
  - rendering socially distributed memories/neurological data as
    inschematic
  - rendering socially distributed information systems as
    inschematic. that is, the information systems themselves that must
    be encoded neurologically within our minds are disparate enough
    such that embedding them in such format as to be indexable is
    impossible
- the intent here is to break the ability to index information from
  the human mind by leveraging traditional psychosocial mind control
  techniques early enough in anticipation of techniques that enable
  the mind to be neurological read.
  - then, once some adversary has the capability to "read" our minds,
    it is both spatially and computationally intractible to index the
    data that is read, which is full of so much inconsistency that it
    is useless.
  - this is, from a marxist materialist perspective, rendering those
    internalized information systems as incogent & unreconcilable.

===============

effort to retain the possibility and existence of conflict or scarcity
of resources in the future when it's not necessary.
- the world could evolve into one that all but forgets conflict or
  scarcity, but there may be efforts to undermine this and encourage
  conflict to continue in order for some to maintain power
  - to some extent, conflict and scarcity have always been
    artificially driven so that some maintain power over others.
  - however, with current technological trends, we could create a
    world where scarcity is replaced by abundance and conflict ceases
    to be known
  - such a world where everyone is fully empowered means that those
    currently in power no longer have the same level of control.
    - it's basically job security for the 0.01%
- does a perfect world need banking cartels or oil conglomerates?
  - if not, what replaces them? what function did they serve to
    society? just resource management and resource distribution?
- in a world that

- intelligence is only a scarce resource when not everyone is
  intelligent
  - but if there was a set of information that was could make some
    people more intelligent because it allowed us to methodically
    process information to combinate existing ideas
    - then anyone could be much more intelligent
- at that point, being smart really boils down to
  - (1) natural ability of someones brain to process information
  - (2) availability of information


==============



- to defeat ad hoc #hashtags from being marked as shadowbanned
  content. you need to start countersignaling. prime the wrong
  hashtag. then convince people to generally switch the hashtag after
  these shadowbanning trolls try to SEO it into oblivion. it's not a
  very good strategy, but it's an effective one. plus, you get the
  data from who engages in the user-led shadowbanning SEO tactics, if
  that is in fact the cause, since people have a choice to amplify or
  phase out content on social media. if you do not see SEO tactics and
  lots of bots (not "russian") it means it is literally Twitter or NSA
  leading the shadowbanning

### Social Physics

#### Lack of Social Signal produces dissociation similar to solitary confinement and isolation tanks

- is similar to the effects that isolation tanks have on the senses,
  but for social signals

- what drowns out ambiguity? social input. it usually gives you
  relevant signals to process. i've said this over and over again. i
  am like literally in solitary confinement, even if the causes are
  incidental. it's ruining my life & the complete lack of signal is
  effectively amplified noise, when adjusted proportionately for the
  lack of input.
  - that is literally what happens in solitary confinement, but with
    complete lack of sensory signals in addition to the lack of social
    signals.
    - basically, your mind tunes into whatever signal it can process,
      regardless of whether its relevant.
  - combined with the total lack of positive incentivization, it's
    devastating in the long term. no one's listened to me yet...
  - total lack of social signal, except for a few, makes those social
    signals stronger via the complete void of alternatives.
    - this makes gaslighting much more effective because that's the
      only signal you get.
      - it helps cults isolate you from your family/friends. you are
        more susceptible when you're hearing only what they have to
        say.
      - it's it helps abusive people isolate/dominate their victims,
        - so their signal/message/input dominates the thought
          processes of their victims
      - it can strengthen interrogation techniques, though it's hardly
        the primary reason why you keep suspects in isolation (or at
        least separated)
      - effectively, it removes all alternative perspectives, when all
        signal is presented with sufficiently similar perspective
        (literally in the sense of multiple points of "vision")
    - it's a fantastic way to induce a factitious disease, if that
      person needed to look crazy, but a little heavy handed as you
      literally have to dominate their life for years in order for it
      to work,
      - especially if they're naturally social people
      - especially if you need to dominate their mental health
        narrative
      - you really have to work hard to destroy their life and whittle
        away the few social connections they might have.
      - if they have financial resources, it will not work because
        they can always *move* around, physically and socially
        - people with options will exercise those options to escape
          pain.
      - SEE THE DESCRIPTIONS FOR OT VII and OT VIII in SCIENTOLOGY
        - "put someone in a corner and keep them there."
        - hmmm... can't find this now, but it's really not worth
          looking, unless you're interested in a handbook for
          psychological torture by analogy, prolonged initiation and
          lots of money.
          - maybe another OT level? but basically, that's the idea:
            fisher price my first "project rehabilitation force" camp.


#### (In Defense of Chaotic Good)

- actually transition into a discussion on chaotic good...
  - always question everything
- "chaotic good" is generally disruptive
  - how can something that rejects order lead to goodness
    - when protection of belief/values systems, virtues, justice and
      the rule of law requires a strong rule of law in itself?
  - for order in social systems, etc: when can strong order be known
    to stand for good? and when can such an order be
    known/demonstrated to stand simply for itself?

- generally testing the ability, power, intent and beliefs of those in
  power. how?
  - by questioning/testing authority.
  - by compelling people to act when needed.
  - by directing attention to issues/problems where needed.



### Philosophy

- the phobia paradox: an irrational fear of not having any phobias
  - my problem is that i'm afraid i'm not afraid of that which i
    should fear

#### Utopia

- without experience that ushers in a sense of urgency, a strong
  opponent or ally becomes weak. this is why
  socialism/communism/utopia is always transient
- the idea of shambala was the precipice of 32 generations of
  successive kings and progressive development. no matter how close to
  perfect the utopia, its intrinsic nature leads to its demise. the
  closer to "perfection" the faster it occurs. paradise or true utopia
  is nature with a constant struggle for survival. every battle, won
  or lost, makes you stronger until there is nothing that can stop you

#### philosophy & logic - additive/subtractive reasoning

- (probably most definitely another real concept for this)

- the scientific method builds on an additive understanding of the
  world and doesn't claim anything is true unless it can be shown
  empirically or demonstrated to be true from arguments ultimately
  dependent on first principles.
  - this is additive because it builds more and more out of these
    first principles
- but there's also a subtractive view of the universe, which starts by
  assuming that everything is possible and filters

- philosophy of identity as we move towards stronger & stranger
  (singularity) ...
  - identity becomes stronger and weaker in various ways
  - technology allows us to mimic each other, our words, faces,
    actions, text, etc
    - so in this way, it's weaker
  - but then, some aspects of identity become stronger

- locutionary camoflage
  - instead of phrases identifiable to some ideology or group, masking
    your images/ideas in the locutions of another group

#### Another argument against dialectical materialism:

- the existence and structure of forms of the collective
  unconsciousness challenge the marxist dialectic.
  - these forms are intangible. some could be argued to have varying
    degrees of dependence on the material, but other aspects may be
    completely void of dependency on the material.
    - for example: the chaotic local ergodicity that is the
      Singularity. this is a shared endpoint that, for chaotic systems
      which could birth intelligent life, is predestined.
      - there are timelines which may end in catastrophe and would set
        back the reemergence of life for millions more years. or
        billions.
      - however, the idea of the Singularity exhibits effects emerging
        from the collective unconsciousness. its existence changes the
        way people act, but it is in some ways ergodic -- this means,
        given enough time and given intelligent life that emerges when
        Earth sits in the habitable zone, the idea itself affects
        material systems even though it is not itself material.
  - other ergodically emergent ideas for intelligent life include God
    (potentially), etc.
    - in this sense, i mean the existence of God as a cosmological
      explanation for the origin/meaning of the world.
    - even if the idea doesn't exist locally for your set of the
      population, its effects or it's potential/definite emergence or
      it's complete absense exhibits influence on material systems
      without emerging from them.
    - so where is this information encoded in material form? it
      doesn't need to be, but when material intelligent life
      acknowledges forces like these, it is advantageous.
      - when early humans understand that thirst & water bring animals
        to drink, then observing/understanding animal behavior near
        water sources means plentiful food.
      - here, the collectively unconscious idea is that animals and
        humans need water. waking up to that, consciously, is
        advantageous. even animals like wolves or bears may take this
        into account.
  - this needs some work, but may lead somewhere with the scourge of
    diamat, which yields the utilitarian and inhumane tendencies of
    tyrants and marxists.
    - particularly interesting is examining the collectively
      unconscious in the context of chaotic systems: can the
      collectively unconscious be defined external to the chaotic
      system or only internally?
      - but if the collectively unconscious dependently originates
        from the internal, material configurations of the matter/etc
        in the chaotic system, how can it exert influence on the
        actions of agents when they haven't created an internal
        representation of the idea?
    - this argument needs a thorough exploration of the collectively
      unconscious to identify types of origination
    - the golden ratio is another good example of a form, which
      emerges from math, but then affects nature -- from the cosmos to
      life and everything else.
      - but it is simply the MOST irrational number, as defined by
        continuous fractions. every one of its phenomenological
        manisfestations in nature result from this and other
        mathematic properties of PHI.

# Computer Science

- NDN (Content Centric Networking) is like platonism for the internet
  - refer to Van Jacobson's talk at Google in 2007
  - NDN addresses data/services on the internet by name, instead of
    location. it's a networking technology that makes DNS/IP
    redundant by naming data/services.
    - there are scalability problems
  - but, since data/information becomes addressed/organized by name,
    instead of by instance/address, it's like platonism for the
    internet.

### Graphs and Simplicial Complices of Electron Configuration Transitions

- meatstability of electron configurations
  - especially the outer shells of heavier metallic elements
  - graphs of transitions between potential electron configurations
    (in outer shells)

### molecular dynamics for covalent bonding & organic compounds

- molecular dynamics for organic compounds: digitize the space of
  possible electron cloud distributions for specific bonding
  combinations
  - can approximate nearly any real electron distribution by
    combination of elements from the "digitized" or "discretized"
    space
    - i'm really not sure what kind of space i'm describing
  - with this technique, it should be possible to idealize the system
    for a particular combination by finding the common product of the
    linear (non-linear?) discretized approximations of electron
    distribution states
  - this idea has applications for optimizations in molecular dynamics
    as well as theory VSPER & quantum chemistry
    - or something like this could already be developed in those
      sciences because you at least need something like what i'm
      describing to model the valid states of molecules
      - e.g. organic chemistry has to account for several
        conformations of glucose and does so via statistics, but this
        is a little more complicated than conformations
- i think this is covered in [non-adiabatic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry#Non-adiabatic_chemical_dynamics)
  - but there may be some optimizations to molecular dynamics software
    based on the ideas described above, with which there are likely
    crossovers with [vibrionic coupling (non-adiabatic bonding)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibronic_coupling)

### spectral dynamics

how much can a signal be scattered before it loses its particular
aesthetic qualities?
- if an electric signal for music is propagating through a gnarly
  headphone cable that causes some dA/dt signal changes to scatter
  differently, how much can it scatter before the changes are
  noticable?
  - where A(t) is amplitude at time t
- can the changes to the signal or the corresponding spectrum be
  predicted in some way? and are there ties back into group theory and
  abstract algebra here?
  - basically the changes introduced to an FFT spectrum by noise
    should correlate in some impossibly predictable way.
    - but what if it weren't impossibly predictable and were instead
      resolvable to number theory?
    - it would have to correlate to number theory in some way. i don't
      know how but it has to. I can see it.
- ... who's brain damaged now?

### 3D video techniques

- use variations in natural lighting from 2D data between composited
  shots to infer 3D geometry, etc.
  - basically, converting (SOME) 2D video to 3D, after the fact

- 3D enhancement techniques
  - stereoscopic video has more possibilities for enhancement of video
  - process interframe data using statistical modeling to increase
    resolution of 3D models from footage

### [Magnetite pollution nanoparticles in the human brain](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/31/1605941113)

- this is really sketchy.
- why is this being seen?
- what is the distribution like in the brain?
  - if it's entering through olfactory nerve & a damanged olfactory
    unit, doesn't that determine its distribution in the brain?
    - different shapes of nanoparticles would distribute differently
      in the brain. if this is natural, that should show.
    - smaller particles should reach 'farther' into the brain, as
      brownian motion via blood vessels and fluid would allow smaller
      molecules to move farther
      - larger nanomolecules would penetrate furter
  - if these particles get inside of someone's brain via some other
    means in any significant way, that means the distribution of
    ferromagnetic particles would react
  - if it's natural, there should be some natural distribution of
    these particles in urban environments and the distribution of
    particles in someone's brain should reflect that.
- because of the changes in distribution of type/shape/size of
  ferromagnetic molecules, any variation or alternate administration
  method should be easily spotted in the distribution of particles
  - ... lulz
- when did this start? has the rate or distribution of particle shapes
  changed?
  - we really need to be able to determine when this started and where
    it's coming from, especially if it's impairing neurological
    function
  - there should be some kind of bitemark analysis here.
    - similar to like looking for specific patterns of neurological
      damage for individial neurotoxins.
    - again, it'd be like reading tree rings. it would depend on amount
      of exposure, geography, habits in life, etc.
- enough ferromagnetic material in the brain could augment the
  functionality of transcranial magnetic stimulation
  - but if it's entering through the olfactory nerve & unit, then it's
    not going to distribute evenly. these are large particles (nano,
    but large)
  - so, if someone wanted to induce a stronger or more specific
    electric current in a specific area of the brain, then these
    magnetic particles *may* help in doing so.
    - that's already possible with TMS
- something along these lines *could* be aerosolized (a la
  "chemtrails") but then probably wouldn't present itself in the brain
  in an acceptable distribution

================

With automated censorship, how do we manage the risk that someone
who's not in violation isn't affected? This is a legal argument in and
of itself because by affecting the free speech of one person via
manipulation of social media algorithms, you are also affecting, and
therefore regulating, the speech of everyone using that platform!

### fdsa

It's similar to the "indirect affect on aggregate commerce" argument
presented by the federal government in the 2005 Supreme Court case,
[Gonzales v. Raich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich). This
argument referenced the precident set in the 1942 Supreme Court case
on taxation of wheat,
[Wickard v. Filburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn).

In Wickard/Filburn, Filburn produced his own wheat for private use to
feed his own animals. This was in violation of the recent 1938
Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which was intended to stabalize
prices of crops. IMO, the fact that Wickard/Filburn involves the AAA
implies a fundamental difference in the relation of the commerce
clause to each: the act of using personal wheat and the act of selling
an illegal substance. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes the
Marihuana Tax Act (MTA) completely irrelevant by completely preventing
cannabis transations.  IMO, that could imply the federal government
doesn't have any authority to regulate trade of cannabis.

The AAA and the CSA are fundamentally different! in Wickard/Filburn,
Filburn flouted the intent of the law by producing excess wheat and
therefore reducing local demand for wheat. This does affect interstate
commerce in that it changes the supply, demand, price and cost of
wheat. However, IMO, the only reason the commerce applies to the
Wickard/Filburn case is because of the nature of the AAA law itself!
IMO, it simply does not apply to the CSA in the Gonzales/Raich case,
but holy shit, the government has some creative lawyers. And whereas
the Wikipedia states the SC opinion mentioned Raich's argument as
weak, I disagree. Yes, prohibition is well within the government's
authority, but the CSA only deals with economics and trade indirectly,
AFAIK. Yes, it bans the trade of schedule 1-3 substances, except
without DEA/FDA authority, but the CSA's approach to the realities
black market economics is the equivalent to an ostrich with it's head
in the sand. The 1937 MTA involved trade via it's sheisty,
non-existent marijuana tax stamps, but is completely eclipsed by CSA,
IMO. And actually, if you stick to the spirit of the constitution,
Raich's tenth amendment argument holds water: where in the
constitution does it mention states

on crops he raised
himself to feed his animals.

the government argued that, even though Filburn's
goods and services only affect himself or his state, the absence of
the demand on the national or global economy


this argument circumvents the spirit of the commerce law somewhat and
invites government overreach.

Nonetheless, it's interesting in that
the government will

- references
  - stanford/etc studies about how bernie sanders had the election
    stolen from him
  - voting machines can be rigged in seven minutes or less


### Combat Poor Democratic Processes Via Well Coordinated Social Media Amplification

- the idea -- completely circumvent the *process* of any national,
  transnational, internation governmental organizations:
  - with a universal "protocol" for "voting" over social media.
    - it's universal and *it's simplicial*. it must be that it
      provides an alternative mechanism for referendum -- effectively
      and without question in it's reliability/etc
  - it's a protocol that is so easy to teach, easy to discover, easy
    to participate in that, assuming:
    - (1) the telecom/internet infrastructure is in place
    - (2) identity has already been verified and can be trusted
    - then this protocol can be used to get worldwide feedback on a
      small number issues every day.

- basically, you propgate the idea that there is one multiple choice
  national or global issue per day. if you care about it, you "vote"
  with a social-media post that contains a hashtag (and perhaps an
  identifier or something)
  - the difference b/w this and any normal tweet storm is that there
    is an agreed upon time for *everyone* to tweet their answer at the
    same time
  - in effect, this hacks newsfeed/socialmedia algorithms to
    prioritize this issue and the response for it.
    - the response structure also contains some information

- it would mostly be used to get newsfeed algs to promote the people's
  message, with the ultimate goal being to increase dialogue on
  whatever topic the idea is about.

- for authenticity and authority of this decision:
  - *for authenticity:*
    - because the time range to post is limited to 5 minutes
      (nationally or globally), this sorta implicitly limits the
      effect that bots can have
    - it is assumed that the verification process for social media
      provides some measure of authenticity, though that's not perfect
      - over time, especially if 3D facial recognition is used to
        guarantee current identity, then the notion of authenticity
        becomes much stronger
    - the protocol stresses unique responses. so the spectrum of
      words/grammar/semantics in responses can be used to measure
      authenticity
      - along with possibly some short md5 hash
  - *for authority:*
    - it's assumed that any authority is conveyed by the effect of
      millions of people posting at the same exact time
      - there is no organization other than the people who get people to
        care enough to schedule a tweet/post
      - there is no official democratic process centered around this.
        - you just either do tweet or you don't tweet
            - no one blocks you out. no funding process to get the
              referendum on the ballot.
              - *NO MONEY REQUIRED*
              - (... except to get the information out about it)
    - so, the authority of this mechanism is balanced against any
      shortcomings in authenticity (lack of validation), availibility,
      etc

Yeh, they are taking an organized approach to policing online debate
and systematically pushing out conservative moderators from FB Groups
and Reddit

So they get every welfare check cashing one of em to stifle the
opinions of hardworking conservative thinkers

Liberals abused the NSA to censor topics, politically, so they could
swing the vote come election time. They use demagoguery to corral
discussion of conservative-friendly topics to FB Groups and/or
Reddit. Then they "stock the pond" of Reddit and FB Group moderators
so these fucking bolsheviks can censor by veto. And don't forget,
liberals fucking run silicon valley and they've been systemically
pushing out conservatives for at least a decade, so those on he right
would be so culturally out of touch, they couldn't figure out what was
happening to stop it.

#### singularity (nihilism and lack of skills)

- these two ideas feed into each other
  - nihilism leads to lack of motivation to develop skills
  - lack of skills leads to lack of understanding and then lack of
    purpose (which leads back to nihilism)
- that's a feedback loop

### Intelligence is not Necessarily Born, it's Made


also. IQ is a number. every person of "average" intelligence -- single
sigma deviation -- is similar. every person of +3 or more sigma
deviation is their own genius. there is no genius that is like
another.  this actually breaks down when you get to higher sigmas of
devlation. so, like +4 and +5 sigma IQ, they are effectively capable
of emulating all lower intelligences. (or so my non-authoritative
understanding goes) and thus, hyperintelligence is convergent so
intelligence itself is paradoxically both divergent and convergent,
when intelligence is considered qualitatively

### Personal Learning Process

- possibly blog about my own learning process
- that International Supply Chain article isn't the only such
  article I've consumed in the past 3 months which has accelerated
  my acquisition of knowledge to personally unknown levels

- step one: find the PDF's *gimme all your PDF's*
- step two: review the PDF's on disk
- step three: rename the files, so they're more easily identified
  on my Kindle, which references the filename and has a limited UI
  - but from the perspective of a reader, the Kindle DX is
    amazing. the Firmware/OS is a bit old, but the battery lasts
    nearly a month... yada yada.
  - again, organizing these docs helps me prestructure the content,
    so i know what kind of questions to task my subconscious
    with. suddenly, my mind is racing with questions and sometimes
    it's too much.
- step four: load them on my kindle and pretend like i might
  actually read 200,000 pages of content someday
- step five: maintain an "on deck" list of 20 documents, with enough
  variety to prevent myself from getting bored.
- step six: pick an article on a topic i am minimally familiar with
  (for as long as there are things I know almost nothing about)
  - this ensures that i maximize my rate of learning by establishing
    a habit of "jumping into the deep-end"
- step seven: read about one topic until it feels like my brain is
  running out of energy.
  - take notes if necessary, but it's really slow.
  - if it looks like i'm too far behind, maybe i should find a class
    on coursera. or if it looks like i need to learn new math to
    understand financial engineering, then do that.
  - in the mean time, until i learn that particular math, then
    high-level video lectures or conference talks will suffice.
    - this is what i resort to when i don't understand enough
      verbage in a paper. this is a really slow way to learn and it
      really sucks when you can't skip the content you already know.
- step eight: switch to another topic until i don't feel like
   reading anymore
- step nine: take a break or watch TV, while my subconscious is
   updating itself.
- step ten: wait for spontaneous ideas to emerge. get excited
   and pretend that no one has thought about them before.
   - remember, i don't communicate with other people. i'm socially
     isolated, so i can't simply ask someone "is this true? is this
     new? does this sound cool?"
   - the only source i can ask is google, which isn't so bad, but much
     slower than a friend with a master's degree in X,Y, or Z
   - this has the unintended consequence of proving that most
     everything I write down comes from within myself (though
     admittedly, much of it is inspired by that one ars technica
     article i read that one time)
- step eleven: smoke weed and think deep thoughts. be the 'jack handy'
  you were meant to be...
  - i hate to mention this, but smoking weed once a month or once a
    week actually helps tremendously, though it also hinders in many
    ways.
- step twelve: rinse, repeat & sleep
  - try to avoid getting too distracted by:
    - lack of income and funds
    - lack of stimulation
    - fatigue and brain fog from lack of nutrition
    - depression
    - impaired hippocampal functionality from protracted depression
      (short-term memory and oher cognitive problems indicating
      neurological changes induced by depression ... & perhaps
      permanent)
    - shiny, but completely irrelevant things
      - a new project, idea, etc.
    - ruminating on depressing factors in my life,
    - feeling that i have been surreptitiously medicated
      - which is very real, by the way, but usually happens only to
        uncooperative patients refusing meds during in-patient care
    - wasting time inspecting my food & eating utensils, trying to
      avoid surreptitious medication. it's basically impossible, by
      the way, unless you can lock your refridgerator. it's a
      time-intensive, unrealistic fear.
    - worrying whether my mom is sabotaging me, which might be more
      depressing than anything else in my life, regardless of whether
      it's true

- that's pretty much it.
  - the problem? it's a !@#$'ing terrible process. there is absolutely
    nothing optimized with this process, except perhaps the immense
    love for learning that it requires to continue, in spite of the
    fact I made less than $2000 in 2015 and less than $500 in 2016
    ... in America, land of opportunity
  - it could be so much better if:
    - (1) i had community
    - (2) i engaged in regular dialogue with similarly passionate ppl
    - (3) i could maintain nutrition/medication/energy
    - (4) i had friends that were into the same things
    - (5) i had other "normal" friends too
- my complaint is that (even for someone self-diagnosed with
  Asperger's) its !@#$'ing trivial to understand HOW to optimize my
  life to both:
  - (1) maximize my rate of learning and
  - (2) improve my own social life.
- yep, that's right. the guy that self-admittedly has a problem
  understanding social life, perhaps more than any other personal
  "deficit" can *quite simply* describe *how easy* it would be to
  improve my life.
  - why is it so hard? because i can't, in good conscience, sell
    myself short. yeh, i could get a job at best buy or something
    else simple.
  - but couldn't someone like me do sooo much more? if i didn't know
    that to be true, i would have given up on myself a long, long time
    ago.
- as much as others claim to help, 95% of what i'm asking for is
  refused with tactics that control/derail the conversation
  - e.g. make david angry about something. anything. it's easy.
  - e.g. make david guilty about something. anything. it's easy.
  - e.g. make david know that it's his fault. everything.
  - e.g. generally prefer to avoid conversations with david, if at all
    possible. (the flipside of this is that it limits my desire to
    engage in conversations)
- e.g. do not budge on anything. the stakes are high (apparently)
  - so, anytime i ask for something, there are about 6 tactics i find
  employed against me, which strain the relationship and make me
  feel like i should rather not ask for anything at all.
  - this stands in contrast to the simplicity of many suggestions i
    have described for:
    - (1) improving my social life
    - (2) improving the efficiency of processes related to a project
    (app or startup)
    - (3) helping me find other people who can help me on a project,
      distract me from my pain, etc.

### Hyperintelligence/Singularity

sufficiently intelligent being should evolve into one of several
*types*, given the proper experiences
- but a being that is more intelligent than that should evolve into
  one that can embody all of them.

- there may be a parallel to a turing test for Hyperintelligent
  Beings: can a being emulate all beings?
  - particularly, can they emulate you at a high-level -- not just
    superficially (patterns of voice/text and parity of locution)
  - can they emulate anyone? everyone?
- in this way, intelligence becomes convergent, yet it is first
  divergent. that is, high-IQ individuals are each their own
  high-intelligence and not necessarily comparable.
  - yet, at sufficiently high intelligences (which may only appear in
    artificial intelligence) they become sufficiently similar because
    the definitive trait of hyperintelligence is the ability to
    emulate all other beings..

### Internet Privacy Snippet

With Chrome, I use the Ghostery plugin, but I don't actually disable
the external server requests.  I have a few reasons for this.  One of
them is that I want some of my data be sent because it ... uhh
... makes my voice heard to some extent.  A lot of people have the
opinion that privacy is a major concern (and it is serious for most
people), yet, they prevent their voices from being heard.

I have a strange philosophic argument where 100% the information that
upload online will be preserved and eventually privacy settings on
individual apps don't matter because eventually 100% of information
will be accessible everywhere.  So it seems like



### Astragalus and Herbs

Astragalus increases hemoglobin levels in red blood cells
- it's shown to be useful for athletes to take on a long-term basis
  - this may be because it increases oxygen retention by red blood
    cells. (look at study)
  - more oxygen in blood means less anaerobic glycolysis, which leads
    to lower lactic acid.
    - body switches to anaerobic glycolysis when it doesn't have
      enough oxygen available
  - more oxygen means energy can be processed more efficiently
    - less lactic acid means less soreness

- similarity mapping from neural lace stream to render data to video
  from the stream's data format

  - there would be a ton of imperfect data from a neural lace, but it
    should be easy to match a location or recreate the actual visual
    field via similarity mapping

# medical ideas

- discretization & delineation of anatomical space
  - {interpreting as: functional spaces mapped into the tissue
    networks of organs (e.g. the distance from nearest capillary,
    along with a means of "indexing" the capillary networks)}

### Blog on the Myopia of Modern Medicene

- (from 2014 ... not so great really)
- comparing where we are to where we need to be
  - to the available real-world applications of of mathematics, esp
    when you've developed various maths.
  - basically the better the data we get with improved methodologies
    - the more we collect and can process,
    - the more patients we can categorize, cluster and cross
    - the more

### Homeopathy as Conventional's Medicene's Straw Man

    got attacked by a drug lord with a drill}



### forensic genomics

#### Forensic proof of CRISPR/etc

- proof of genetic engineering or genetic therapy by sequencing
  epigenomic state and looking for abberations in the distribution of
  genetic program changes in a tissue sample from organ
  - probably after death ... womp womp
    - or maybe not
  - but the emphasis here is to find abberations in the patterns of
    distribution of epigenetic state
    - and compare against the epigenomic variations in samples from
      other other organs & tissue types
  - if there are epigenomic aberrations in other organs besides the
    target gene's activation tissues, this may imply poorly
    implemented gene therapy

#### Forensic Proof of toxin exposure, even relatively long-term

- analyze liver tissue & CYP450 (& CYPXXX) enzyme distribution/usage
  to determine estimates for toxin typology and exposure
  - this could help determine when someone has been exposed to
    long-term toxins
    - {this needs specific use cases, because it won't be very widely
      applicable}

### Medical Device Ideas

#### BioAssay from Fingernail Scrapings

- device to scrape top of fingernails while preserving spatial
  information about a sample. so, it scrapes enough off the top of
  your fingernail to get samples that preserve temporal information.
  - the samples can then be analyzed for:
    - Toxins: Arsenic, Mercury, Thallium, Lead, etc
    - Mineral Deficiencies: Magnesium, Calcium, Potassium
    - lack of vitamins/minerals for specific periods of time can be
      correlated to symptoms of illness much more easily
      - any time you have temporal components in your data, it greatly
        expands the kind of inferences that you can make
  - the difference here and one-off urine tests is that the doctor
    understands a history of the patient's mineral deficiencies
    - instead of a single value that is expensive to collect
    - this would have been incredibly useful in my case.
  - this would also be useful in childhood neglect cases
    - or just in the case of identifying children who are not
      receiving proper nutrition from their diet, which is common.
    - lack of minerals like Mg, Ca, K, etc can lead to lost
      opportunity during childhood growth & development
      - almost every child & adult in america has multiple mineral
        deficiencies: usually Magnesium is one of them.

  - regardless of the solution to this problem, people need a simple
    way of quantifying their nutritional intake that provides a stream
    of time-series data.
    - this can be correlated to health problems, so that we can
      actually solve them, instead of being bankrupted by them.
    - there is so much data we could be collecting that we're
      not. these devices and processes should reach the consumer, but
      evolution of medicine is very slow bc of strict regulations.
    - almost all of our food in America is grown own minerally
      deficient soil. the food is GMO and is tailored for a marketable
      presentation, but that is it.
      - *if you read the nutrition labels, there are almost zero food
        items in america that give you 100% of a _single mineral_ in
        10 servings or less!*
      - buying minerals in ionic form (as they are included in the
        most common multivitamin supplements) they are only absorbed
        by your body if they happen to create the bioavailable form.
        - you have to buy food-derived mineral supplements.
        - Magnesium Stearate, Magnesium Oxide, etc., etc do not get
          absorbed at high rates. it is sometimes sufficient.
          - but if you have a serious mineral deficiency, you must
            take food-derived supplements. there is only one
            supplement with magnesium & calcium that i trust, but it's
            very expensive ($40/month)
      - this is just an example of how hard it is to eat healthy and
        stay healthy in this country.
        - you're constantly marketed to, but so much of it is bogus.
        - then, on the other end, we're being dragged down to
          bankruptcy by health care costs and we wonder why.
          - it's the food, first of all. this doesn't fix the problem
            that exists now, but fixing the food prevents the problems
            we encounter later.

#### Raspberry Poo

- it's a computer on a suppository w/ microchip
  - include microphone, etc
  - "surgically" place the device, so that you can pass a check
  - surgical precision check
  - simple remove/activation med(?)
  - async data transfer

misc religion:

- read chapters from Kings 1/2 and take notes 4 articles
  - stream while reading the chapters
- article about why the 10 commandments are important and shouldn't
  offend anyone if the state wants to display 10 rules it'd adhere
  to. I'd rather live in a government that has constraints.

================

argument that as society evolves faster, it's harder to be sure
society is really moving forward on the correct path.
- it becomes harder for us to observe when some critical needs/roles
  are no longer being fulfilled by society or social institutions
- similar to premise paradox of creativity, but moreso the
  sociological and epistemological consequences of technology-driven
  and/or exponential societal innovation
- furthermore, it's exponentially more difficult to understand whether
  you're going to have the right education programs (& etc) in place
  to properly fill the roles needed one or more generations down the
  road.
  - you have to anticipate demand for products and jobs you don't even
    know about yet and how that may affect
