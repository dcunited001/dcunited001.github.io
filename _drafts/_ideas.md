### startup ideas

- Blockchain X Medium (see blockchain notes)
- app to backup/facilitate access to documentation for old appliance's
  electrical components & circuit diagrams
  - i'm sure there's already an app for that
  - this would be excellent with an app for recognizing gear with a
    3d/2d camera
    - it wouldn't just recognize the top-level product though, it
      could recognize the individual components and list the top-level
      VCR/DVD/etc product that the components were used in
  - an app like this would be most useful when paird with a community
    to foster reuse & recycling of antiquated gear
    - it would be useful to connect user's with suggested products to
      hack together with old VCR parts
      - kind of like suggested recipe's for individual ingredients
  - the challenge for this app would be building the community
    - it would be a bit of a challenge to break into the market
      because i'm sure there's already competition
    - so the challenge is to establish market share without running
      out of funding, so that all the appropriate pieces of the
      community can be built

- parse USC federal & state law sections as "trees" to rebase the
  language so that it's functionally equivalent, but more simply
  expressed
  - rebase as in github, where you make the series of commits more
    simple. so, each bill passed through congress is like a "commit"
    in a git project. and they reference and merge in changes by
    referencing the law sections like an addressing scheme
    - but this is really complicated.
    - so it'd be useful to have software that parses this stuff
      semantically, so that the laws can be more simply understood and
      loopholes can be more easily identified.
  - an app like this would be very useful for people that are
    writing bills
    - you could have continuous integration and "automated testing"
      for congressional assistants to aid in writing bills

effort to retain the possibility and existence of conflict or scarcity
of resources in the future when it's not necessary.
- the world could evolve into one that all but forgets conflict or
  scarcity, but there may be efforts to undermine this and encourage
  conflict to continue in order for some to maintain power
  - to some extent, conflict and scarcity have always been
    artificially driven so that some maintain power over others.
  - however, with current technological trends, we could create a
    world where scarcity is replaced by abundance and conflict ceases
    to be known
  - such a world where everyone is fully empowered means that those
    currently in power no longer have the same level of control.
    - it's basically job security for the 0.01%
- does a perfect world need banking cartels or oil conglomerates?
  - if not, what replaces them? what function did they serve to
    society? just resource management and resource distribution?
- in a world that

- intelligence is only a scarce resource when not everyone is
  intelligent
  - but if there was a set of information that was could make some
    people more intelligent because it allowed us to methodically
    process information to combinate existing ideas
    - then anyone could be much more intelligent
- at that point, being smart really boils down to
  - (1) natural ability of someones brain to process information
  - (2) availability of information

### Philosophy

philosophy & logic - additive/subtractive reasoning (probably most
definitely another real concept for this)
- the scientific method builds on an additive understanding of the
  world and doesn't claim anything is true unless it can be shown
  empirically or demonstrated to be true from arguments ultimately
  dependent on first principles.
  - this is additive because it builds more and more out of these
    first principles
- but there's also a subtractive view of the universe, which starts by
  assuming that everything is possible and filters

- philosophy of identity as we move towards stronger & stranger
  (singularity) ...
  - identity becomes stronger and weaker in various ways
  - technology allows us to mimic each other, our words, faces,
    actions, text, etc
    - so in this way, it's weaker
  - but then, some aspects of identity become stronger

# science

### molecular dynamics for covalent bonding & organic compounds

- molecular dynamics for organic compounds: digitize the space of
  possible electron cloud distributions for specific bonding
  combinations
  - can approximate nearly any real electron distribution by
    combination of elements from the "digitized" or "discretized"
    space
    - i'm really not sure what kind of space i'm describing
  - with this technique, it should be possible to idealize the system
    for a particular combination by finding the common product of the
    linear (non-linear?) discretized approximations of electron
    distribution states
  - this idea has applications for optimizations in molecular dynamics
    as well as theory VSPER & quantum chemistry
    - or something like this could already be developed in those
      sciences because you at least need something like what i'm
      describing to model the valid states of molecules
      - e.g. organic chemistry has to account for several
        conformations of glucose and does so via statistics, but this
        is a little more complicated than conformations
- i think this is covered in [non-adiabatic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry#Non-adiabatic_chemical_dynamics)
  - but there may be some optimizations to molecular dynamics software
    based on the ideas described above, with which there are likely
    crossovers with [vibrionic coupling (non-adiabatic bonding)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibronic_coupling)

### spectral dynamics

how much can a signal be scattered before it loses its particular
aesthetic qualities?
- if an electric signal for music is propagating through a gnarly
  headphone cable that causes some dA/dt signal changes to scatter
  differently, how much can it scatter before the changes are
  noticable?
  - where A(t) is amplitude at time t
- can the changes to the signal or the corresponding spectrum be
  predicted in some way? and are there ties back into group theory and
  abstract algebra here?
  - basically the changes introduced to an FFT spectrum by noise
    should correlate in some impossibly predictable way.
    - but what if it weren't impossibly predictable and were instead
      resolvable to number theory?
    - it would have to correlate to number theory in some way. i don't
      know how but it has to. I can see it.
- ... who's brain damaged now?

### 3D video techniques

- use variations in natural lighting from 2D data between composited
  shots to infer 3D geometry, etc.
  - basically, converting (SOME) 2D video to 3D, after the fact

# dreams

dream where this dog (a great dane) kept licking my face
- kind of a silvery coated great dane
- i'm not sure how i met the dog. i was in some building with open
  space and open floors, like a dance studio, but in the back area
- when i met the dog, she was with her owner, who was also a
  photographer (very famous locally or something)
  - the dog seemed to be one who had been raised somewhere like floyd
    and wasn't accustomed to meeting people very often.
  - it's personality seemed to indicate that she wasn't guarded and
    never needed to be reprimanded for being a dog.
    - the dog didn't seem to know what it meant to be a dog.
- anyways, the dog saw that i was kinda down.
  - it had something to do with the night before and being alone
  - she immediately started licking my face, which i normally hate,
    but i just didn't do anything.
    - she kept doing it for a few minutes and the owner thought it was
      hilarious... i have no idea it was a dream
- the owner tried set us up for a photo, but in doing so, the dog
  suddenly lost interest in licking my face which prompted our
  interest in the first place.
  - no matter what we did or how we tried to egg her on, she wouldn't
    do it anymore after that.
- kind of a wierd dream, but there was a point to it, i promise

# Memory

### [Magnetite pollution nanoparticles in the human brain](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/31/1605941113)

- this is really sketchy.
- why is this being seen?
- what is the distribution like in the brain?
  - if it's entering through olfactory nerve & a damanged olfactory
    unit, doesn't that determine its distribution in the brain?
    - different shapes of nanoparticles would distribute differently
      in the brain. if this is natural, that should show.
    - smaller particles should reach 'farther' into the brain, as
      brownian motion via blood vessels and fluid would allow smaller
      molecules to move farther
      - larger nanomolecules would penetrate furter
  - if these particles get inside of someone's brain via some other
    means in any significant way, that means the distribution of
    ferromagnetic particles would react
  - if it's natural, there should be some natural distribution of
    these particles in urban environments and the distribution of
    particles in someone's brain should reflect that.
- because of the changes in distribution of type/shape/size of
  ferromagnetic molecules, any variation or alternate administration
  method should be easily spotted in the distribution of particles
  - ... lulz
- when did this start? has the rate or distribution of particle shapes
  changed?
  - we really need to be able to determine when this started and where
    it's coming from, especially if it's impairing neurological
    function
  - there should be some kind of bitemark analysis here.
    - similar to like looking for specific patterns of neurological
      damage for individial neurotoxins.
    - again, it'd be like reading tree rings. it would depend on amount
      of exposure, geography, habits in life, etc.
- enough ferromagnetic material in the brain could augment the
  functionality of transcranial magnetic stimulation
  - but if it's entering through the olfactory nerve & unit, then it's
    not going to distribute evenly. these are large particles (nano,
    but large)
  - so, if someone wanted to induce a stronger or more specific
    electric current in a specific area of the brain, then these
    magnetic particles *may* help in doing so.
    - that's already possible with TMS
- something along these lines *could* be aerosolized (a la
  "chemtrails") but then probably wouldn't present itself in the brain
  in an acceptable distribution

================

With automated censorship, how do we manage the risk that someone
who's not in violation isn't affected? This is a legal argument in and
of itself because by affecting the free speech of one person via
manipulation of social media algorithms, you are also affecting, and
therefore regulating, the speech of everyone using that platform!

### fdsa

It's similar to the "indirect affect on aggregate commerce" argument
presented by the federal government in the 2005 Supreme Court case,
[Gonzales v. Raich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich). This
argument referenced the precident set in the 1942 Supreme Court case
on taxation of wheat,
[Wickard v. Filburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn).

In Wickard/Filburn, Filburn produced his own wheat for private use to
feed his own animals. This was in violation of the recent 1938
Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which was intended to stabalize
prices of crops. IMO, the fact that Wickard/Filburn involves the AAA
implies a fundamental difference in the relation of the commerce
clause to each: the act of using personal wheat and the act of selling
an illegal substance. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes the
Marihuana Tax Act (MTA) completely irrelevant by completely preventing
cannabis transations.  IMO, that could imply the federal government
doesn't have any authority to regulate trade of cannabis.

The AAA and the CSA are fundamentally different! in Wickard/Filburn,
Filburn flouted the intent of the law by producing excess wheat and
therefore reducing local demand for wheat. This does affect interstate
commerce in that it changes the supply, demand, price and cost of
wheat. However, IMO, the only reason the commerce applies to the
Wickard/Filburn case is because of the nature of the AAA law itself!
IMO, it simply does not apply to the CSA in the Gonzales/Raich case,
but holy shit, the government has some creative lawyers. And whereas
the Wikipedia states the SC opinion mentioned Raich's argument as
weak, I disagree. Yes, prohibition is well within the government's
authority, but the CSA only deals with economics and trade indirectly,
AFAIK. Yes, it bans the trade of schedule 1-3 substances, except
without DEA/FDA authority, but the CSA's approach to the realities
black market economics is the equivalent to an ostrich with it's head
in the sand. The 1937 MTA involved trade via it's sheisty,
non-existent marijuana tax stamps, but is completely eclipsed by CSA,
IMO. And actually, if you stick to the spirit of the constitution,
Raich's tenth amendment argument holds water: where in the
constitution does it mention states

on crops he raised
himself to feed his animals.

the government argued that, even though Filburn's
goods and services only affect himself or his state, the absence of
the demand on the national or global economy


this argument circumvents the spirit of the commerce law somewhat and
invites government overreach.

Nonetheless, it's interesting in that
the government will

#### singularity (nihilism and lack of skills)

- these two ideas feed into each other
  - nihilism leads to lack of motivation to develop skills
  - lack of skills leads to lack of understanding and then lack of
    purpose (which leads back to nihilism)
- that's a feedback loop


===============

### Personal Learning Process

- possibly blog about my own learning process
- that International Supply Chain article isn't the only such
  article I've consumed in the past 3 months which has accelerated
  my acquisition of knowledge to personally unknown levels

- step one: find the PDF's *gimme all your PDF's*
- step two: review the PDF's on disk
- step three: rename the files, so they're more easily identified
  on my Kindle, which references the filename and has a limited UI
  - but from the perspective of a reader, the Kindle DX is
    amazing. the Firmware/OS is a bit old, but the battery lasts
    nearly a month... yada yada.
  - again, organizing these docs helps me prestructure the content,
    so i know what kind of questions to task my subconscious
    with. suddenly, my mind is racing with questions and sometimes
    it's too much.
- step four: load them on my kindle and pretend like i might
  actually read 200,000 pages of content someday
- step five: maintain an "on deck" list of 20 documents, with enough
  variety to prevent myself from getting bored.
- step six: pick an article on a topic i am minimally familiar with
  (for as long as there are things I know almost nothing about)
  - this ensures that i maximize my rate of learning by establishing
    a habit of "jumping into the deep-end"
- step seven: read about one topic until it feels like my brain is
  running out of energy.
  - take notes if necessary, but it's really slow.
  - if it looks like i'm too far behind, maybe i should find a class
    on coursera. or if it looks like i need to learn new math to
    understand financial engineering, then do that.
  - in the mean time, until i learn that particular math, then
    high-level video lectures or conference talks will suffice.
    - this is what i resort to when i don't understand enough
      verbage in a paper. this is a really slow way to learn and it
      really sucks when you can't skip the content you already know.
- step eight: switch to another topic until i don't feel like
   reading anymore
- step nine: take a break or watch TV, while my subconscious is
   updating itself.
- step ten: wait for spontaneous ideas to emerge. get excited
   and pretend that no one has thought about them before.
   - remember, i don't communicate with other people. i'm socially
     isolated, so i can't simply ask someone "is this true? is this
     new? does this sound cool?"
   - the only source i can ask is google, which isn't so bad, but much
     slower than a friend with a master's degree in X,Y, or Z
   - this has the unintended consequence of proving that most
     everything I write down comes from within myself (though
     admittedly, much of it is inspired by that one ars technica
     article i read that one time)
- step eleven: smoke weed and think deep thoughts. be the 'jack handy'
  you were meant to be...
  - i hate to mention this, but smoking weed once a month or once a
    week actually helps tremendously, though it also hinders in many
    ways.
- step twelve: rinse, repeat & sleep
  - try to avoid getting too distracted by:
    - lack of income and funds
    - lack of stimulation
    - fatigue and brain fog from lack of nutrition
    - depression
    - impaired hippocampal functionality from protracted depression
      (short-term memory and oher cognitive problems indicating
      neurological changes induced by depression ... & perhaps
      permanent)
    - shiny, but completely irrelevant things
      - a new project, idea, etc.
    - ruminating on depressing factors in my life,
    - feeling that i have been surreptitiously medicated
      - which is very real, by the way, but usually happens only to
        uncooperative patients refusing meds during in-patient care
    - wasting time inspecting my food & eating utensils, trying to
      avoid surreptitious medication. it's basically impossible, by
      the way, unless you can lock your refridgerator. it's a
      time-intensive, unrealistic fear.
    - worrying whether my mom is sabotaging me, which might be more
      depressing than anything else in my life, regardless of whether
      it's true

- that's pretty much it.
  - the problem? it's a !@#$'ing terrible process. there is absolutely
    nothing optimized with this process, except perhaps the immense
    love for learning that it requires to continue, in spite of the
    fact I made less than $2000 in 2015 and less than $500 in 2016
    ... in America, land of opportunity
  - it could be so much better if:
    - (1) i had community
    - (2) i engaged in regular dialogue with similarly passionate ppl
    - (3) i could maintain nutrition/medication/energy
    - (4) i had friends that were into the same things
    - (5) i had other "normal" friends too
- my complaint is that (even for someone self-diagnosed with
  Asperger's) its !@#$'ing trivial to understand HOW to optimize my
  life to both:
  - (1) maximize my rate of learning and
  - (2) improve my own social life.
- yep, that's right. the guy that self-admittedly has a problem
  understanding social life, perhaps more than any other personal
  "deficit" can *quite simply* describe *how easy* it would be to
  improve my life.
  - why is it so hard? because i can't, in good conscience, sell
    myself short. yeh, i could get a job at best buy or something
    else simple.
  - but couldn't someone like me do sooo much more? if i didn't know
    that to be true, i would have given up on myself a long, long time
    ago.
- as much as others claim to help, 95% of what i'm asking for is
  refused with tactics that control/derail the conversation
  - e.g. make david angry about something. anything. it's easy.
  - e.g. make david guilty about something. anything. it's easy.
  - e.g. make david know that it's his fault. everything.
  - e.g. generally prefer to avoid conversations with david, if at all
    possible. (the flipside of this is that it limits my desire to
    engage in conversations)
  - e.g. do not budge on anything. the stakes are high (apparently)
  - so, anytime i ask for something, there are about 6 tactics i find
    employed against me, which strain the relationship and make me
    feel like i should rather not ask for anything at all.
    - this stands in contrast to the simplicity of many suggestions i
      have described for:
      - (1) improving my social life
      - (2) improving the efficiency of processes related to a project
      (app or startup)
      - (3) helping me find other people who can help me on a project,
        distract me from my pain, etc.

### Internet Privacy Snippet

With Chrome, I use the Ghostery plugin, but I don't actually disable
the external server requests.  I have a few reasons for this.  One of
them is that I want some of my data be sent because it ... uhh
... makes my voice heard to some extent.  A lot of people have the
opinion that privacy is a major concern (and it is serious for most
people), yet, they prevent their voices from being heard.

I have a strange philosophic argument where 100% the information that
upload online will be preserved and eventually privacy settings on
individual apps don't matter because eventually 100% of information
will be accessible everywhere.  So it seems like



### Astragalus and Herbs

Astragalus increases hemoglobin levels in red blood cells
- it's shown to be useful for athletes to take on a long-term basis
  - this may be because it increases oxygen retention by red blood
    cells. (look at study)
  - more oxygen in blood means less anaerobic glycolysis, which leads
    to lower lactic acid.
    - body switches to anaerobic glycolysis when it doesn't have
      enough oxygen available
  - more oxygen means energy can be processed more efficiently
    - less lactic acid means less soreness
