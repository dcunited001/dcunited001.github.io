# [A Spectral Theory of Information](#a-spectral-theory-of-information)

A critical idea for understanding sociological dynamics, generally and
especially in the 21st century, is **spectral information
theory**. Without it, you can't make predictions about trends on
social media. You can't even understand the causal implications of
your own actions in our technocracy.

It essentially provides a spectrogram for information, where
individual instantiations of information are frequencies and their
amplitudes correspond to their prevelance. One way to explain it to
children is "What's your favorite word? What do you think your
friend's favorite words are? What do you think the class's favorite
word is?" -- that's not so complicated, is it? Put away your crayons
and your liberal arts degree(s), this is the stuff marketing and
communications is made of, folks. With advances in computation and
analysis, it's about to become cold, hard science.

### [The Era of the Subjective is Coming to an End](#the-era-of-the-subjective-is-coming-to-an-end)

We will discover that the capacity for subjectivity evaporates as our
collective computational prowess expands. That's right:
post-modernists be damned, subjectivity has always been a fleeting
illusion. The good [old] news is that the bars of your newfound
structuralist prison are reigned in by limitations imposed by
computational complexity and free-energy. The degree by which the
potential for subjectivity is mediated is a problem of social
engineering and metamodernism: to balance the energy requirements of
computation with the needs of society for the realized
phenomenological benefits for efficient computation, society must
adapt itself informationally. Language, knowledge and other cultural
artifacts need to be architected to maximize the benefits of
computation. Without cheaply indexed language and culture, humanity
depletes itself of energy without gaining phenomenologically
significant returns on technology.[^caelis-ruissant]

  - This conceptualization for information crosses into the territory
    of music theory! ... mapping
    information in terms of *tones* and *information chords* that
    correspond to times-series emissions of patterns of cliques via
    algebraic graph theory. The graph-theoretic structures can be
    mapped to an over-arching, all-encompassing ontological structure
    of generalized information-geometric tones & chords. A universal
    language should be based on this ontological structure -- and
    recursively analyzing the overlap between semantic mappings of
    language pairs should provide insight into the structure of this
    global generalized ontological structure.

### [調: Acknowledgement of the Spectral in Eastern Languages](#acknowldgement-of-the-spectral-in-eastern-languages)

In Japanese, the concept of 調 (chou) means both *investigate* and
*tone*. The symbol 調 is used in words that represent "condition;
state of affairs", "investigation" and "auditory tone".  At first
glance, this seems counterintuitive -- but when you investigate, you
seek to ask questions that indicate the amplitude of informational
tones. 調 is composed of the symbol 周 (circumference), modified by
the radical 言 (say, word). If you wanted to see how far across the
social graph information had spread, how would you identify where to
look and how broadly? You would probably investigate.

**Choushi wa dou?** means, loosely "what's going on?". Other
derivations from 調 more clearly imply the combined denotative
*semantic tones* from 調: investigate (information acquisition) and
tone.

#### 調和: Harmony

#### 調査: Investigation

#### 調合: Compounding or Dispensing a Medicine

#### 調子外れ: Discord

#### 調律: Musical Tuning

#### 調味: Seasoning (literally tone-flavor) -- with connections to 意味 (literally idea-flavor)

#### 調号: Musical Key Signature

#### 調波: Harmonic (wave)

#### 調声: Tonal Mark (viz. Pinyin)

#### 調べ直す: To Re-examine or Reassess

#### 調心輪: An Aligning Ring, which guides a piston's motion to stabalize its timing in an engine

#### 調べ合わす: To Tune To or To Check Against

Other interesting words in the same semantic vain can be delineated
from the characther 曲's connection to both music and curvature. where
線 simply means line, the combined 曲線 means curve.

In the west conceptualizing in terms of the spectral is almost
entirely relegated to the obscurantism of the occult, native speakers
of eastern languages get these concepts for free -- no initiation
required! While the semantics of many of the same concepts do appear
in Western languages, they appear in idioms, in myths or in forgotten
aspects of etymological evolution. The Han Dynasty's writing system,
which propagated from Middle China to Japan and Korea, slowed
linguistic evolution in the Far East by binding morphemes

You can see how the practices of Shinto and Taoism openly deal with
managing the spectral content of information. Though it might be
sacrilegious, if one were to run computational linguistic analysis on
Ema tablets, you would produce spectral insights into the collective
desires of the community served by the shrine.

![Ema Tablets](/img/posts/2019-03-05-disnormalization/ema-tablets.jpg)

The practice of hanging and burning Ema tablets facilitates an
exchange of information that helps priests and religious organizations
tune into the needs of their community. Christianity has similar
practices -- dedicational prayers, devotionals, or even confessions --
where the [teleonomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleonomy) niche
fulfilled is to facilitate informational exchange critical to serving
the community or to orient individuals to be receptive to change.

### [Wat? You Mad Bro?](#wat-you-mad-bro)

In the West, you practically need to sell your firstborn to the
Illuminati or your soul to the Masons to operate with these
concepts. It is forbidden knowledge and, albeit cryptically, the
impact that the spectral has on western societies is covered in the
book [The Law is a White Dog](). Accumulating "informational taint" by
one's actions or social associations ...

In the west, the consequences of association with tainted individuals
range from mildly burdening your reputation to all-out [Corruption of
Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attainder) in the
extreme. Corruption of Blood, in its legal implementation, is a
practice associated with attainder, but as it and other forms of
attainder can occur implicitly or as a consequence of a sociophysical
program, it is not strictly dependent on a legal mechanism. The Law is
a White Dog deals with the spectral consequences of accumulation and
diffusion of taint in society -- in America, the Constitutional
provisions prohibiting Bills of Attainder have been circumvented by
secret law and secret precedent, as well as the prohibitions of Cruel
and Unusual Punishment.

Secret law itself seems carried out by occult traditions and is
thereby extra-legal: you are never nominally punished, but are
subjected to "extra" helpings of legal process until whatever shadowy
forces behind the scene that direct law and "order" see that society
at large believes that the individual's punishment has been meted out
fairly. Nothing will be left of the individual's social memory, except
ghost stories. If [the extralegal bullshit that happened to me in this
case](https://github.com/dcunited001/bb8) had been pulled off, I would
never be able to receive a Visa to live in Japan. Do these people
care? No. It is a foregone conclusion to them that my life is already
and always will be *forfeit*. Forfeit to what? I don't even know.

The same mechanisms by which these spectral processes proceed are nigh
verboten for open discussion in the West, but so commonly understood
in the East that they have been encoded into the semiotic and semantic
structures of the Han Dynasty's written language for over two thousand
years. Why? Because the individual is sacred in the West and the
collective is enshrined in the East. Again, why?  Because the West was
always reacting, economically and sociopolitically, to developments
occuring in the East. To congeal to a sociopolitical collective was to
conform to dynamics with causal momentum set in motion by the
East. Why? In addition to the geoeconomic distribution of resources
and commerce, it is because the day begins in the East and the causal
implications of economic or sociopolitical events ripple westward,
giving the East an timelessly insurmountable advantage for proactively
driving dynamics the West would respond to. This advantage has
subsided in the modern era, but the impacts to the evolution of
language and especially philosophic thought will never be erased.

### Explain The Image of a Spectrogram

- Where the amplitude of each Idea-Tones' frequency can be seen as the
  aggregated attention invested in that idea over time - Whereas the
  frequency axis in an audio spectrogram is simply linear with special
  relationships encoded into harmonic frequencies, the axis is far
  more convoluted for an information spectrogram.  - And while it
  isn't so simple to explain, the conceptualization of ideas plotted
  in an infospectrogram is still relevant.

- Useful as an ontological structure that algebraically provides a set
  of generalized statistical models, which may be used to analytically
  approximate any statistical system -- regardless of tensor rank,
  which is increased by every algebraically irreducible direct sum.
- Similar to the algebraic structures describing convexity in high
  dimensions or enumerations relevant to Gaussian curvature.
- Does the difference between norms (as distribution) and beliefs
  about them provide a basis for descent using fisher metric to find
  the infogeometric analytic structure(s) that generate(s) the
  perceived norm.
