- TODO: (top priority) figure out what word to use for
  "determinedness" -- perhaps German (Bestimmtheit, Gewissheit) --
  preferably something distinguished from its senses in Math and
  Philsophy, since I mean "determinedness" as a kind of intersection
  of both, where the latter is primarily concerned with causal
  implication of action and i'm discussing the causal implications of
  neurological processes that give rise to psychological phenomena,
  modeled in terms of analytical systems of deep learning as they
  relate to overfitting and underfitting.
  - in contrast to the mathematic notion of "determinedness"
    analytical systems are used in AI to approximate an unknown or
    ineffable system of equations, thus it's not necessary for an
    overdetermined to be consistent.
  - I'm mostly discussing a notion of how well-defined the remaining
    possibility space has become after it is etched away by an
    analytical model, typically to minimize a cost function.
  - An overfit k-means clustering model, the volumes of each cluster
    should usually span over less volume of space.
    - Obviously, this can't be taken to be generally true, but by
      tuning the hyperparameters to train many instances of a k-means
      clustering algorithm to dilineate its model's fitting along k,
      then you can automagically arrive at optimal values for k,
      although the pair of algorithms are expensive to train *and*
      prove difficult to separate from implicit biases in training
      data.
    - Given a similar situation, you can set up a pair of algorithms
      to train many k-means clustering models, but with identical k
      and instead varied along hyperparameters that attempt to
      delineate and score the clustering. The over-fitting and
      under-fitting are scored by analyzing how the bounding volumes
      of each cluster of each change with respect to their ability to
      efficiently "capture" the range of test samples. If the clusters
      are simply defined as linearly-bound volumes of space; if they
      are distributions, then to define bounding volumes for clusters,
      it requires estimating distributions for each cluster, then
      applying a threshold function to filter the distribution's
      minimal values. If your clusters are correctly classifying large
      volumes of sparsely populated regions where the density of
      samples is infinitesimal (but for whatever reason, the cluster
      correctly classifies them) then a simple threshold function will
      not properly define the volume of space used to score the
      top-level hyperparameter-tuning function.
      - One significant challenge to this lies in reconciling the
        nature of training representations that lie along some
        incredibly complicated hyperplane of solutions. Each time a
        cluster model is generated by the top-level cluster-generating
        algorithm it starts with random values and proceeds towards a
        random point in this along this hyperplane, thus the generated
        clusters score nearly identically for a given set of
        hyperparameters -- they are nearly equidistant from "most
        optimal" in terms of cost function. However, as
        hyperparameters are tuned, your cluster model values begin to
        stratify themselves almost concentrically with respect to that
        models average score.
      - however, since every point along those concentric rings in
        analytical solution space of cluster model values actually
        represents a completely distinct set of values for clusters,
        then reconciling disparity amongst those models with the cost
        function and hyperparameter backpropagation mechinism is
        complex, depending on whether the hyperparameter(s) alter the
        linearity of the lower level cluster algorithm -- which may be
        multilinear itself
        - (i'm not sure. i think it's a strange form of bilinear with
          a binary classification layer)
    - So! By training this pair of algorithms to delineate
      "fittedness" of clusters along various hyperparameters, you can
      theoretically generate many models with cluster volumes whose
      proportion to the density of sample distributions corresponds to
      a delineation of overfit to underfit.
      - segue to connect this to "determina"



    construct some function to approximate how the overfit model
    distributes its valuation of samples into the space

    and you collect a
    distribution of samples in the system's space, then volume of the
    possibility space where

    then
    applying various combinations of these
    volume of possibility space when

    determinedness then



Misc
=======

- terminology
  - "progression/recession" have special meanings within jungian
    psychology, so using "progressions" to describe iterations of the
    hero's journey is imprecise.
  - individuation/deindividuation
    - how can these ideas of "analytic neurology" (particularly
      over/under-determinedness of systems that neurons emulate)
      connect to the above de/individuation?

- (briefly) contrasting the ideas of freud/jung
  - compare freud's ideas to be similar to qualitatively dilineating
    the IV's for a DiffEQ (where you find the IVP)
    - i.e. what is the beginning state? how does the mind build upon
      itself when there is very little there and plasticity is
      pervasive
  - jung's ideas? (about openings/closings/turnings, cyclic
    progressions, the end)
    - the progressions of jung are for the individual what the
      ebbs/flows of metamodernism are for modernist society (the
      convergence towards modernism, followed by a need for
      differentiation that produces the (abstract speciation of ideas)
      that is post modernism)
      - how does the above connect to individuation?

- "hyper-realism" and over-determinedness of information systems
  - move this to article with a discussion on epistemology?
    - semioteleological revolution
  - how the extremely wide distribution of information results in the
    cultivation of individual information sets which are thoroughly
    self-reinforcing, in rationale and logic.
  - the space of the unknown -- as it people both conceive it and are
    influenced by the shadow of its unconscious aspects -- shrinks
    until information systems become rigid (at micro/macro levels)
    - at a sociological scale, this and other phenomena produce
      effects similar to jungian developmental progressions seen in
      the psyche of individuals
  - though (strangely?) there doesn't seem to be an abundance of this
    hyperrealism on socially distributed information systems.
  - an example: the mechanically rigid affect of the zealous athiest
    or, more socially, of a large group of zealous athiests.
    - their belief systems reinforce each other.
  - a less contrived example: think of the internet's influence on
    society if all the fallacious information never existed?
    - there is starkly more coherence in these information systems.
    - in that world, its nearly impossible to introduce new
      information if it doesn't fit coherently into the graph of
      information (or knowledge)
    - since, in that world, all information exhibits similarly high
      interconnectedness, then to be considered seriously as
      information in that world, new information needs to
      stochastically similar degrees of interconnectedness in the
      graph of information.
      - if it has inconsistencies, it's thrown right out because
        almost no information in that world is incongruent with its
        set of informational connections.
      - you might try to introduce informational non-sequitor, which
        is trivial and connected minimally to the graph of information
        - but this information also deviates sharply along many
          statisical signals in its neighborhood of the information
          graph
    - what happens sociologically as people approach this point? of
      course, individuals consume small sets of the total graphs of
      information and knowledge (... define here as higher-order
      information)

- how an individual's mind perceives "reality" with/out (pervasive)
  application of rationalistic/logical tendancies at the
  metaprogramming level --
  - all (they) can see is what their mind allows them to accept as
    true, if they're rationalistic at the metaprogramming level

- [How your brain is conspiring against you making good
  software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiNmaUuefCY&index=43&list=PLfMzBWSH11xa-iNnQG2555lgi4574nZOh)
  - researched used "categorical syllogism" to test processes in
    rational thought
    - this and other methods (for confirmation bias, etc)

- how does someone's mind change when certain facets of
  metaprogramming change? e.g. especially the part of the
  consciousness that evaluates whether information is true, could be
  true, etc. and acts as the filter which selects which information to
  consume and begin extrapolating from?
  - like the [Overton
    Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), this filter
    can be narrowed/widened. you can be conditioned to have this
    personal overton window opened wider.
    - (story about the driftwood?)
    - in which case, you're more willing to ingest and extrapolate
      from highly underdetermined information
      - this is what happens with gaslighting.
      - you're told to "trust" while you're isolated and not capable
        of verifying what the gaslighter is feeding you, but don't
        seek confirmation/consultion from people around you.
    - the target becomes conditioned to believe anything, given a few
      cues here and there, which act as reinforcement.
      - next thing you know, the person has full-blown
        [Erotomania-by-proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotomania)
  - can this state of individual's rationalistic filter be conditioned
    when the person (patient?) is voluntary and/or aware?
    - i don't think so. pretty much not ever.

- how psychedelics modulate this threshold of (required)
  analytic-determinism, for much lower levels of the brain
  (sub-subconscious up through the conscious levels) to induce a
  (state of jungian ... (malleability/plasticity of mind))
  - there's been a lot of effort to provide purely neurological
    explanation of psychedelics effects on plasticity, but this is an
    analytic-psychological explanation for psychedelics, which
    requires neurological propositions, but explains what it does to
    the *mind* to experience states like this (connect to the outline
    on how experiencing first signs of MS might be percieved by the
    mind, since they are highly distinct from sensory input thus far.)

====

- why are tastes & smells far more strongly coupled to memory
  formation/activation than other senses?
  - the basis for the answer is not purely psychological or
    neurological, but rather informational. as Socrates expounds in
    the latter books of the Republic, the interfaces between the human
    mind and each sense is phenomenologically distinct. we hear what
    is close, but can see all that is not directly occluded. we
    control the volume, tone and even the direction of our voice to
    modulate the radias of the elipse enveloping people we intend to
    signal to. in our experience of the visual, anyone's body occupies
    proportionally equivalent area in our visual field that we occupy
    in their visual field. If a reflection permits some portion
    someone's body, then they can likely see our reflection. If any
    reflection carries in its image an eye, then there is a ray that
    can be traced from our eye to theirs.
  - however, upon analyzing each sense's signal quantitatively for the
    range and variance in forms represented by sensory signal --
    taking into account how the images are composited into a single
    stream of sensory data that our mind processes for each -- then
    one finds that smell and taste are profoundly distinct,
    *informationally*.
    - in dogs, olfactory signals implicate the point of origin and
      trajectory for gustatory images composited into the signal,
      calculated by comparing timing of signals along with the
      spatiotemporal components of olfactory receptor activation.
      - more plainly, a dog can track multiple scents, traveling from
        various directions because its mind is utilizing the
        arrangement of olfactory receptors to infer more information.
      - though dogs as a species are epigenetically tuned to produce a
        greater variety of gustatory receptors and can thus
        distinguish between a far greater array of scents, their minds
        also process a greater range of olfactory signal and enough
        such that spatiotemporal inferences can be made
      - dogs can easily navigate towards the gradient of an incredibly
        faint scent because they process this spatiotemporal
        information indicating direction, timing and magnitude of
        components of olfactory signal.
    - humans lack the diversity of gustatory receptors, but more
      critically the quantity and anatomic form that enables such
      spatiotemporal inferences to be made with scent. So, this
      creates (qualitative and quantitative differences) in the
      gustatory information that the cranial nerve preprocesses as it
      carries that signal (into the Thalamus)
    - if the spectral & representational differences between olfactory
      functionality provided to dogs and humans is significant, then
      differences of a similar nature but far greater magnitude
      present themselves when comparing representations of form
      encoded into human sensory signal with those representations
      found in olfactory signal.
      - that is, especially for vision and hearing, the spectral range
        of encountered representations is far greater, the clustering
        of (perceived representation: ~qualia?) around the recognized
        representation is distributed with more variance/skew and the
        perceived representations are all classified in a tightly
        interconnected space of perceiveable forms.
        - dilineate perceived/recognized representation (where the
          latter implies the form that the subconscious classifies
          similarly to computer vision algorithm)
      - moreover, there are sources of bias in
        quantity/quality/expression of perceived visual and auditory
        signals.  particularly, the primarily mechanical complexity of
        signaling artificially constructed forms within sensory data
        profoundly impacts the phenomenology of each sense, distinct
        from sense to sense.
        - the mechanical complexity of generating olfactory signal
          means asserting confidence in authenticity of the stimilus
          is computationally simpler, extrapolating *accurately* to
          insights associated with the stimulus.
          - in probabilistic systems, this almost-inherent
            authenticity is incredibly useful because you can be
            almost certain that infrequently perceived olfactory forms
            are authentic, since they typically require natures
            dominance over organic chemistry to be present whatsoever.
        - further, specific olfactory forms are tightly bound to their
          contexts and such context are likewise tightly bound to
          interconnected olfactory stimuli types.
        - salience of sensory stimuli is another quality that shapes
          and skews the distributions of recognized forms carried by
          sensory signal: recognizing some forms within sensory data
          can require attention or strongly impact our utlization of
          it, skewing what our mind perceives. this varies from sense
          to sense
    - informational aspects of signal for each sense shapes how our
      mind extracts forms from them. various metrics associated with
      the spectral and representational aspects of sensory data
      strongly affect the basis for *clustering* forms in the
      high-dimensional space of neural networks. a perceived form,
      after being classified by deeper layers of sensory processing,
      triggers neural activations that mimick clustering algorithms,
      which sparsely encode cluster membership as recognition of
      represented form.
      - because mechanics of clustering depends so strongly on the
        informational aspects of senses, processed individually and
        concurrently, this quantiatively impacts the basis for
        indexing, associating and interrelating recognized forms.
        - in other words, if the mind were to index smells that it
          recognized, how would it do so logically, informationally,
          neurologically? is it quantitatively easier to do so for
          olfactory data, visual data or auditory data?
    - several primarily informational aspects of specific senses
      contribute to their strong/weak activation:
      - (1) the set of associated experience contexts in which the
        form has been recognized and associated with
      - (2) the quality of inferences extrapolated from the
        recognition of a form.
        - specifically, inferences can be made with near certainty
          profoundly simplify extrapolation in probabilistic systems
          -- especially those constructed algebraically from graphs,
          involving sparse signals. this is because you can assume the
          probability of some event types is `p(e) >= 0.99` and thus,
          for "adjacent" events, it is extremely unlikely that the
          correlated inference does not hold. moreover, *any* insight
          with a basis of certainty lends itself to deductive
          inference ... for free!
      - (3) the "quantity" of recognizable or distinguishable forms
        (in machine learning, a parallel would be the quantity of
        neurons/nodes in the uppermost layers of neural networks)
        - the informationally derived phenomenological differences
          amoung the senses drastically alter the structure of neural
          networks that emerge around them.
        - this has a huge impact on the formation, association and
          regulation of neural circuits built on top of the sensory
          processing streams (that converge in the thalamus?)

====

- Neuroanalytic impact of sensory imagery in the functioning of
  neurological manifestations of analytically approximated algorithms
  - the impact of a stead spatially-locked image in centering the mind
    with respect to the neurologically encoded state necessary to
    maintaining balance in a handstand
  - this seems a little frivolous, so make an analogy to other
    algorithms with and without such "locking/centering" imagery,
    which (in an informational sense) reduces the uncertainity of the
    system via calibration to that sensory stimulus by collapsing the
    possibility space

====

- concept of salience from neurology
  - where/how should this term be applied to simplify expressions in
    this article and in my writing?

- "analytic neurology" and neuro-lingusitic programming
  - why do the techniques of NLP exhibit their specific effects on our
    minds?

- delineate typological/onological and replace where necessary

- apply various filters to audio signals from synth. do specific
  frequencies have an effect? low frequencies & harmonics?

- zazen meditation and visual input modulation/distortion
  - connect this to the komuso sect of monks from the 17th century and
    the tengai(tengui) baskets they wore

- reading discontinuities (& propagation of infinite values/etc) from
  various points in networks,
  - and inferring the remaining connections/structure of a mostly
    unknown analytical model

- learning a new topic (e.g. kanji) as an example of progression from
  underdetermined information system to overdetermined. when the
  system is overdetermined, the knowledge is self reinforcing, as
  there are many ways to validate what you know.
  - on a graph, there would be many "validation paths/cliques" as you
    add more nodes of information

- refer to Ars Technica [Creative Hot
  Streaks](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/07/what-do-scientists-artists-and-filmmakers-have-in-common-hot-streaks/)
  article for verbage describing "break-throughs" in Jungian
  progression and how these correlate to how flexible/rigid our
  personal information systems are.

- connect neurology to components of analytic psychology, especially
  the metaphysical components (archetypes) and patterns of
  developmental (progression)
  - (this needs to come after establishing this connection)
  - how do analytical machines tend to give rise to the same
    developmental/morphological patterns, which result in similar
    metaphysics
  - what (architypical phenomena) are typical or consistent or even
    universal in the development/experience of analytical machines?
    which facets of their structure/experience are responsible for
    giving rise to these archetypes/patterns?
  - how does the apparent "determined-ness" of an analytical
    model/machine's emulation of a system change as the analytical
    model/machine develops?
    - in other words, for the ranges of concepts/inferences that
      appear to be overdetermined or underdetermined to an analytical
      machine, how do these change with the structure, training, or
      development of the analytical machine?
      - e.g. when you're a kid, your limited knowledge of the world
        allows you to model/emulate a more limited set of systems and
        they all mostly appear to be underdetermined -- which makes
        any concept *seem* flexible and usually novel as well.
        - by flexible, i mean that you can't anticipate how things
          will change, but expect what you know to change (or at least
          expand)
        - when you're young, there is also much that appears to be
          overdetermined, but ends up being false or incomplete
          (because you didn't know what you didn't know)
    - this over/underdetermined-ness changes over time. how does this
      relate to the developmental patterns of Jung (hero's journey,
      etc) and how does it relate to the "analytic/systems philosophy
      definition of love"
      - it's this determined-ness that defines how "real" and
        "well-defined" that reality seems to be to someone
        - how can change their subjective awareness of the world with
          the intent of provoking changes to how determined various
          systems seem to be? is it always easier others to change our
          perspective & (subjective awareness) in such a way that
          provokes real change in "determined-ness" of the systems
          that our sub/conscious mind sees?
      - even though this determined-ness fluctuates over time, is
        there some limit to how often/frequently that we can provoke
        real sub/conscious change in "determined-ness" by relearning
        the world around us?
        - how does the residue of what we already know affect the
          flexibility of our perspective in the future?
        -
      - how does this determined-ness affect our perception of the
        determinism of our lives? if we generally have over-determined
        conceptions of systems in life (esp. surrounding more critical
        phenomena/systems) then are we more likely to be
        pessimists/optimists ... with regard to our trajectary in
        life?
        - are we then more likely to see our fate as a mostly fixed
          path, since our sets of knowledge lead us to subconsciously
          examine most systems as though they are over-determined?
        - if we see our personal over-determined (perspective) as a
          limiting set of beliefs that constrains the flexbility of
          our sub/consciousness -- but we also *know* that our
          understanding the world is correct, since it is highly
          scientific and rational -- then how do we disrupt our
          determined fate?
      - why should we ever allow ourselves to be fixed by our own
        beliefs/knowledge in this way?

### Analytic neurology and the third-eye:

- what are the mind and brain doing?
  - in your mind, when preparing for a trance-like state, you focus on
    visualizing semiotic signs, characters, (ASL) signs and gestures
  - first visualize without the notion of color completely, then focus
    on visualizing in black+white, then in color
  - focus on visualizing simpler imagery/signs, like latin
    characters. then gradually begin visualizing more
- from an analytic neurology perspective: what is happening here? what
  is your mind doing? how can properly running through these exercises
- when I successfully enter a particular kind of trance-state and your
  third eye "snaps" into resolution, complicated imagery in 3
  dimensions suddenly dances before my three eyes. it's not easy to
  get into this state, but what is happening here? if i reflect to
  intensely on it, i lose the trance state and the imagery stops.
  - i can't really control the imagery, i am merely witnessing it.
  - it's amazing though, like i've activated some inherent ability of
    my mind to augment it's computation, effortlessly.
- this experience stands in constrast to these "analytical
  neurological" conceptions of the mind, unless explained as a
  visceral experience of the subconscious mind running deep-dream-like
  generative algorithms on itself.
  - but generally, analytical machines classify input and experience,
    leading to a reduction in the dimensionality of input. the
    complexity of the signal generally funnels into lower
    dimensionality. it embeds itself or encodes itself into a lower
    range. this is what encoders do.
  - for it to expand the range of input implies that the subconscious
    mind is expanding the complexity of signal and re-experiencing it.
    - is it doing this constantly, only witness upon the serenity of
      meditation? or is it the placidity of such trance-like states of
      consciousness that *enable* the mind to begin generating content
      in this way.
    - i believe it is a combination of both.

### Varying degrees of dis/entanglement in variational autoencoders

  - extrapolating from the [arXiv insights video on variational
    autoencoders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zKuYvjFFS8)
  - the "disentangled" networks are closer to a "pure" typological
    representation, whereas the entangled representations are
    analytical approximations of mixtures of pure representations of
    the system
    - those most disentangled representations of the system should be
      closest to a system of equations corresponding to a graph.
  - if you train many encoders with varying degrees of entanglement,
    then combine them to classify/generate input, their composition
    should
  - the disentangled networks can coalesce towards metaphysical
    systems of information metaphysically dependent on the material
    - but they can also approach metaphysically immaterial information
      systems
    - correlate this to transcending the limitations of analytic
      philosophy
  - the usage of the word "disentangled" in Marcel Proust's "Swann's
    Way"

### "Breaking" the Brain's conceptions of reality through Hyperbolic Geometry in VR

- this is a nice setup for the discussion on psychedelics (since it's
  similar in nature, but doesn't require/involve chemically triggered
  altered states of consciousness.

- [Call of Cthulu E3 2017 Trailer]()
- reality is not direct, but mediated through your brain. however,
  your brain can only conceive of what it has experienced
- so, if there's some constraints of its experience which are
  universal, then by introducing experiences, which in manner that
  feels like reality, then violates those constraints, it forces your
  brain to undergo an "analytic pullback" and reassess how it
  interprets reality
  - [pullback](https://wikipedia.com/pullback)
  - although, it's likely that such changes wouldn't really feel like
    such profound transformations, experiencing it has got to afffect
    your brain somehow

- it's also very similar to how psychedelics might introduce similar
  changes by violating the schematic qualities of reality that the
  brain has otherwise deemed universal and eternal

##### Psychedelics violate similar assumptions held as axiomatic by the mind

- reality-violating effect that psychedelics can have. the experience
  of something that violates what you know in a logical sense.
  - causes you to question what you know about reality in a vividly "a
    postieri" kind of way
- that's one of the "double-edged sword" qualities of psychedelics.
  using them allows you to experience things like that, but then if
  those delusions persist or if you provoke too much neurological
  disorder with regular consumption of psychedelics, it's damaging.

### Cause of Persistent Hallucinations After Psychedelic Trips

- the same thing can be caused by using mid-quality VR Content where
  frustum parameters are distoorted in a *distinctly unnatural* way.
  - doing so, especially with VR, requires high-levels of BDNF to
    cause neural entworks to attempt to generalize their own new
    frustum parameters, when before, the need for any parameterization
    of frustum whatsoever was unnecessary
    - that is, before any such experience that violates the
      universiality of the anatomic frustum which has sufficed for
      one's entire life, there is no need for neural networks to
      parameterize the aspects of frustum inferred for reconstructing
      ocular stereoscopic imagery
  - but as soon as one experiences stereoscopic imagery which requires
    the inference of dramatically altered frustum in order to
    reconstruct said imagery, then neural networks respond to the
    dissonance by attempting to generalize this notion so that the
    frustum parameters can be generalized.
    - when there are sufficient neurotrophic factors like BDNF in the
      synaptic context of the regions relevant to visual processing,
      then adaptations of the neural circuitry can occur.
    - if the synapses are pliable enough during these experiences --
      which were starkley incogent to the axiomatic analytical
      assumptions of any previous experience known to those neural
      networks -- then those neural circuits networks can internalize
      and persist the novel parameterizations.
    - in the case of psychedelics and visual processing, this can
      result in permanent distorions of certain patterns of visual
      input, since given the *DUAL SPACE* of that input pattern's
      cogency with sets of frustum paramters, the mind must allow
      itself to experience that visual input as though all valid
      possibilities in the possibility space were true.
      - thus: visually distorted imagery.
  - this concept is similar to the subtle psychological/neurological
    differences between those who can see the 3D in a magic eye poster
    and those who cannot. The difference is that the inferred frustum
    of the 3D imagery is moreso generalized than for Magic Eye
    posters.
    - notes from iPhone about magic eye

- so, basically, during psychedelic utilization, the neural networks
  begin processing/forwarding information which completely violates
  any schematic assumptions, for which those neural networks held
  processed input to be universally consistent with all previously
  known input.
  - this inschematic input acts analogously to machine-learning
    training data of an ontologically distinct order.
  - because, during psychedelic utilization, regions of the brain are
    also in a more neuroplastic state, then this distinct, dissonant
    training data forces the concurrently flexible neural networks to
    adapt by generalizing to the newfound *DUAL SPACE* via
    parameterization.
  - to the analytical nature of neural networks, the probabilities of
    occurances similar to the erroneous input are no longer
    infinitessimal. thus, the analytic models reified by the structure
    of the neural networks must forevermore account for those fleeting
    observations which shattered any preconceived axiomatic notions of
    reality's possibility space.

#### Missing No., the Pokemon That Breaks Your Game

![Missing No., the Pokemon that breaks your game]()

![Also, Twice Pieceman]()

- [the reasoning is...] From an analytic philosophy standpoint, if the
  epistemic structure of all pokemen can be represented by discretized
  data -- or at least defined represented in terms of the other
  available pokemon data -- then Missing No is a value for a
  Pokemon-type epistemic structure which breaks the mold (and even
  breaks the game's save-data)
  - similarly, there are experiences which can break our own
    neuroanalytical systems which our minds use to represent
    reality. encountering and processing information about such
    metempsychotic (...-breaking) experiences does not necessarily
    break our conception of reality so severely as to render us
    completely insane. still like

- the more overall "symmetrical" or coherent an analytical system
  seems to be when such a transformative reevaluation event is caused,
  the greater the resulting structural effects will be
  - an image for zenith of this concept is like imagining the
    distribution of mass/energy before the big-bang as complete and
    perfect, except for a single flaw, which sparks all of the myriad
    forms that emerge to reconcile such a minuscule lack of symmetry
    - the more perfectly (symmetrical) that a container for analytical
      representations is before the moment that sparks its
      destructuring and reorganization, the greater the impact will
      generally be on its more final organization after restructuring.
      - an example of a "container for analytical representations"
        would be the part of the human mind that is the "universal"
        part of the human mind's "universal quantum-information
        computer", the part that emulates analytical represenations
        within it.
  - further, this is not an instantaneous change. similar to the
    mandate that valid solutions to Navier-Stokes must not contain
    discontinuities within that solution's solvable bounds for `t` in
    `0 >= t > T`, such an analytical system must continue to be
    capable of operating with valid analytical representations of the
    information systems it processes while it undergoes its structural
    changes.
    - what would the human mind experience if it could not maintain
      these functions while it's mental structure were undergoing
      minor or major changes? psychosis, nervous breakdown, extreme
      anxiety.
      - these are informational consequences of analytical forms
        represented by neural structures of various scales. the
        structure and interconnections of these neural features
        themselves are always shifting to adjust to input/experience.
    - this process of psychological/neurological reconfiguration would
      seem to violate perceived continuity of qualititive aspects of
      consciousness and might include particular mental states while
      dreaming and transformative spiritual experiences
      - the capacity for these states of consciousness to reconfigure
        the human mind is related to the degree of incoherence of the
        signals being processed. the greater the ineffability of the
        experience when processed analytically, generally the more the
        mind will need to reorient itself to process, understand or
        explain the experience.
      - the person or artificial entity experiencing these states of
        mind with profound ineffability may not emerge as the same
        entity. if these theories are correct, then it may mean that
        artificial intelligence also has the capacity for
        transformative spiritual experience.

### Preserving Continuity of Function Requires Persisting Structure in Evolving Analytical Machines

- learning things incorrectly, then untangling the mess to unlearn,
  then relearning things correctly. why doing so leaves a disorganized
  structure in an analytical machine (like the human brain)
  - the neural circuits that correspond to the incorrect way of
    learning things can never be completely lost. furthermore, an
    analytical machine will then tend to learn the "correct" way in
    terms of symbols/structures encoded by it's initial formartion of
    structures representing the "incorrect way".
  - this means there is always some "cruft" left behind in the form of
    neural circuits which can't be completely pruned away, especially
    since they encode the "correct" understanding of some phenomenon
    in terms of classifications dilineating the correct in terms of
    the incorrect. So thereafter, some analytical machine that must
    preserve continuity of functionality never has a purely correct
    construction, but a mixture of correct in terms of the incorrect.

#### While Meditating, To Observe One's Cognition of The Experience of One's Cognition Of...

![Recursion, as it relates to the image of the Lotus]()

- (in other words), There is no perfect means of development or form
  for analytical machines. As such, they are inherently flawed. the
  only perfection is in moving forward with their existing form's
  recursive development. To this end, if the mind is a jewel, one
  should not simply accept its imperfections as they are, but leverage
  the jewel's flaws as a kind of fingerprint that ripples through its
  structure as an analytical machine in order to make inferences about
  the structure of the jewel of their mind as it evolves towards
  perfection.

### Connect the Above To Authentic Transformative Spiritual Experience

- the above ideas only touch on the experience of the visual, the same
  resounds as true for any experiential information processed by
  neural networks in the brain.

- how the experience of an authentic transformative spiritual
  experience ... if its reverberations through socioinformational
  circuits are not dampened, then impact societies' information
  systems by provoking a similar reevaluation of socioanalytical
  systems.
  - to society, such the reverberations of such transformative
    spiritual experiences are similar in effect to the experience of
    love for the individual (according to my explanations below)
    - in that, to have one, individuals in society must be
      analytically overdetermined and primed to experience something
      relevatory that resounds of "the next level"
    - once a member of society has experienced something that
      viscerally breaks the overdetermined schema of known-experience
      and known-experience types, then they are forced to reconcile
      this difference between the relevatory aspects of this
      inviolating experience with that (of society's condition) by
      embarking on a quest for truth.
      - piece by piece, as propagate the components of such new truth
        as is required to reconcile their transformative spiritual
        experience, then individuals in society are transformed
        themselves, as receipt and forced examination of these pieces
        of information shatters their own worldview, previously
        subconsciously held to be overdetermined and now suddenly
        revealed to be inadequate.

  transformation with sociological consequences

### The purely informational impact of Infinitesimals on Psychology and AI


- in statistical models and systems theory, the effect that
  infinitesimals have on how people:
  - model systems,
  - develop beliefs about confidence,
  - miscalculate,
  - struggle w/ unknown unknowns
  - respond to traumatic/rare experiences

- and this is because attempting to model event types for which there
  is no precedent or extremely rare precedent requires turning our
  values systems and models of systems upside
  - why? because the expection of events which seemed to have had
    “almost never” probability (a misnomer) now appear to be more
    frequent (in P(e) terms) than they did before or than the average
    person would tend to believe that they are.
  - thus, to the person (or system or AI) experiencing the event with
    infinitesimal probability, the event no appears to be
    infinitesimal.
  - in the context of psychology (esp. psychology w.r.t. traumatic
    events with high magnitude impacts) the person/system then
    responds to that infinitesimal event with individualized responses
    & motivations & coping mechanisms that seem to be distorted or
    inordinate to others

- phenomonologically (or perhaps noumenologically), this is a purely
  informational effect that the existence/experience of the
  infinitesimal has on the re/evaluation of beliefs system,
  re/evaluation of beliefs about the probabilistic Expectation of
  similar events in the future … causes complex de/structuring of
  systems which render many game theory or systems theory models
  wildly inaccurate.
  - these are defect of information theory, systems theory, etc that
    pose major challenges for artificial intelligence, since these are
    not defects of a model (per se), but purely informational
    consequences based on the stroke of luck of having experienced
    some range of infinitesimal set of events.
  - the same AI or person could re-experience a typical “life” or set
    of experiences and emerge with a different collection of
    infinitesimal-probability events that — because of the
    high-magnitude impact of their experience on the analytical
    system’s evolution — necessitate a divergence in the direction of
    their specific development.
  - so, based on the specific collection of the high-magnitude
    infinitesimal events and the sequence in which it encounters those
    events, it causes the AI/person to develop in a completely
    different direction.
  - this is no consequence of the hardware/wetware that the person/AI
    is running on. these are purely noumenological/informational. the
    specific hardware type does have some correlation to the types of
    effects these high-magnitude, low-probability events can have.

- in skewing social media algorithm results


### How to address the informational impacts of Infinitesimals in AI

- from a qualitative understanding of the how infinitesimal values
  from many trainings of an algorithm relate to each other, refine
  many instances of an analytical model into a single instance of an
  analytical model with far more effective "coverage" of the space of
  infinitesimally-valued events. so, you are focused on refining the
  parity of the space of infinitesimals -- since the presence/absence
  of encountering infinitesimally-valued and properly valuing their
  impact on your algorithm is critical for accuracy and comprehensive
  coverage of cases/types.
  - this is critical for representation learning and quantum learning

- train many instances of a machine learning algorithm (ML1).
  - have the higher-level algorithm (ML2) note a "boundary" of
    infinitesimally-valued layers or event types. extract
    ontologically a quantitative understanding of the qualitative
    "meanings" of your infinitesimally valued nodes/elements from ML1
    algorithm instances
    - here, you are correlating subsets of values from ML1 instances
      with each other. Each their own analytical system with similar
      rates of accuracy, . such approaches for refining many instances
      of some lower-level ML1 algorithm are already widely used.
  - from there, utilize a diffeomorphic approach.

- how to apply the above to psychology and why it matters for
  freud/jung (especially for diffeomorphic understandings of
  psychological development contained in Freud's work)

### And from then everafter, the phrase "we shared a moment" was never the same...

- literal statistical moment's (esp. skew)
  - the higher the moments that are "shared" the more resounding the
    implications are for individuals who share moments.

- bridging analytical psychology to neurology
  - covering ideas form analytical psychology at the level of
    neurology

- in order for anyone to understand this i need pictures...
  - draw.io?

- define the following concepts and rename
  - analytic neurology: does this describe the emergence of
    psychological phenom from lower-level neural circuits?
    - what does this term mean and does it encompass what i'm writing
      about?
  - "cognitive tracing"
  - "neural tracing"

- clearer language for the following terms:
  - physical activities/skills/behaviors
  - motor skills/behaviors/coordination

- connection b/w writing left-handed and fine motor control for guitar
  - connect this in from an analytic-neurology perspective
  - how training the mind to engage in behaviors with the opposite
    hand, forces the mind to neurologically restructure the pathways
    for that activity so that there are some changes in
    neuro-circuitry when reengaging in those behaviors with the
    dominant hand.
  - Becuase of the specifics of modular coodination of neural
    circuitry, there is no way for the mind to relearn an activity
    using the non-dominant hand without restructuring the original
    circuitry. This doesn't imply that the effects on the engagement
    of that activity using the dominant will be profound -- since the
    mind is modular.
  - However, there will be some changes on the lower-level mappings
    between the motor circuits and those circuits responsible for
    interaction state, perception, etc.

### Social Disconnection and the Jungian Hero's Journey

- on short & long-term time scales

- social disconnection results in stagnation of motion along the
  ego/self axis. there is no opportunity for your ego to acknowledge
  external signals representing society's understanding of the self
  - without these signals there is no capacity for reconciliation of
    the ego/self
  - (there are exceptions!) sometimes isolation, whether self-imposed
    or not, does result in extreme reevaluation of the self.
    - whether there will be (transcendent at all levels) re-evalution
      in the structure of the psyche, resulting from the isolation,
      can be seen in short-term time-scales in how the absence of
      input influences the selection/expression of behaviors,
      especially the selection of behaviors related to seeking
      psychosocial homeo-stasus
    - that is, we all seek to move towards states of psychosocial
      homeostaus in how we *feel* towards the emotional/intellection
      state of our ego in relation to ourself and others.
      - in order to move towards the preferred "normal" states, we
        un/sub/consciuosly select to express behaviors (similarly to
        how genes might be expressed)
      - in short-term isolation, does the selection profile for those
        behaviors change? or does it stagnated. Either extreme change
        or extreme stagnation will result. in the long-term, there
        will usually be eventual stagnation, especially as the
        spectrum of psychosocial experience is typologically filtered.
      - that is, in isolation, the range of types of experiece are
        geneally reduced (with some exceptions).
        - if this is so, the person will eventually settle on specific
          ranges of response types of psychosocial behaviors to those
          moreso limited stimulus types. in other words, without types
          of experiences provoking/compelling adaption, how can you
          expection someone to adapt?

### The Brain as an Analytical Machine

- other interesting aspects of the brain as an analytical machine
  - it is essentially a quantum computer, although it doesn't harness
    quantum-mechanical effects
- modeling the brain as an analytical machine requires tensor
  networks, just as modeling quantum computation. why?
  - because both are fundamentally stochastic.g

### THC Dampens recently/frequently active neural circuits

- how THC's mechanisms that dampen most active pathways are like the
  modulation of hyperparameters in Hyperparameters of Neural
  Networks
  - as frequent pathways are dampened, this forces the circuits to
    connect in new ways. these new pathways then reinforce themselves
    such that when the brain no longer has THC/cannabinoids modulating
    neural pathways, it's set of frequent pathways are more likely to
    begin including those pathways reinforced while high.
  - describe this mechanism in detail.
    - since your brain is an analytical machine, the (neural circuits)
      that are activated are the equivalent to the weighted (paths:
      define this in more detail) in neural networks
      - however, where CBN receptors are distributed in the brain, THC
        dampens neural ciruits that have been recently activated.
      - for your brain to pursue the same objectives while its primary
        circuits for that activity are dampened, it must leverage
        alternative neural circuits. this is partially responsible for
        THC's renowned ability to enhance creativity.
      - however, the metabolic degradation pathways for THC (via CBN,
        etc) cause fatigue, etc (do i bother describing this?)
  - in order to use marijuana to most effectively enhance creativity,
    it requires transforming your (subjective awareness) of it's
    effects on your cognition.
    - because marijuana dampens the primarily active neural circuits
      (in proximity to where THC receptors are located in the brain),
      then you have to subjectively anticipate this and understand how
      it specifically affects your cognition.
      - also, your cognition is causing various neural circuits to
        activate, but after brief periods of activation, those
        circuits are dampened.
      - to enhance creativity the most, you'll want to control your
        cognition to broaden the "spectrum" of neural activiations by
        partkaing in a wide variety of activitys in the two-three
        hours after using it.
        - if you stick to just one activity, the neural circuits
          related to that activity, as well as the newly activated
          circuits which are "adjacent" alternative pathways for
          completing the same task-types, will instead all become
          dampened.

### Emulating the Evolution of Physical Systems With AI

- To train AI to play pinball, what structures emerge in the design of
  the AI?
  - pinball is a game based on physical systems. Given a 3D model of
    the space of the pinball machine, without an understanding of the
    the mechanics of the components, a pinball machine is basically a
    specialized 3D particle system with one particle. Unless, of
    course -- *MULTIBALL*.
  - given the ball's position, momentum and associated derivatives,
    there's a tensor structure that describes the most likely
    evolutions of the system. when approaching the brain as an
    analytical machine whose cognition is augmented by the qualatitve
    aspects of the activities it masters, this is very interesting
    indeed, since the brain must overcome the same emulations of the
    pinball machine's physics as an AI.

- the tensor structure should look something like this:
  - Need to describe this in more detail
  - for every discretized point, there are connected points in the
    space. navigation between the graph/lattice of these points is
    determined by the ball's velocity/momentum/acceleration
  - some points of the board produce consistent functional coupling
    whereby the ball's velocity/momentum/acceleration is transformed
    in some consistent albeit probabilistic manner.
    - so, when the ball gets close to a bumper, it's likely to
      modulate the acceleration of the ball in such a way that depends
      on the specific momentum.
  - after observing enough events, the AI should begin to assume that
    areas of the board are associated with: (1) physical modulations
    of the ball (2) scoring events for reinforcement learning (3)
    state-transition events, which may not be necessary to model for
    simple RL-based learning.

- how do the trained tensor structures differ b/w pinball machines?
  - more critically: what does the generalization of models for
    pinball machines tell us about how analytical machines model
    gamified physical systems?
  - how can extending the

- When training AI to play pinball with complicated rules and more
  complicated spaces, there may be a point where it is required to
  program in logic related to the pinball game's rules. With simpler
  machines, no such logic programming is required.
  - Where are the distinctions between the simple pinball machine and
    the physical machines that are too complex for a simple AI to
    master?
    - This would be similar to the distinction between video games
      that are "easy" for AI to master, like Donkey Kong, and those
      that are more open-ended and harder, like Zelda.

  - This distinction must arise from the complexity of state and
    state-transitions, coupled with the difficulty of accessing some
    states, whose behaviors significantly modulate the interactions
    and dynamics of the activity.  Whether considering a videogame or
    pinball machine, when some of the state-transitions or events in
    gameplay are highly unlikely, then all dependently-associated
    events are proportionally less likely.
    - multiball as a global state change, causing all the rules of the
      game to change
    - if the gameplay rules change significantly when activating such
      a state transition with infinitissemal probability, then that
      event is unlikely to be encountered often enough for the AI to
      train for it, unless the AI models or develops an understanding
      of novelty of experience. If so, then the AI can seek out
      experiences that seem novel, but to do so, it may require that
      the AI choose to expend time/resources, in spite of not
      receiving a reward for doing so.

### Continuity of Differential Systems Combined With Stochastic Inferences

- the imposition of continuity constraints has significant
  implications, even for deterministic systems of differential
  equations. (connect to lie algebra)

- Differential systems have continuity constraints which provide
  points of inference when combined with stochastic modeling. The
  evolution of these systems usually involves
  [Runge-Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge–Kutta_methods),
  which allows the evolution of the system to predicted by analyzing
  and extrapolating the projection of derivatives. Some formulations
  of Runge-Kutta lend themselves (more effectively) to analytical
  - Imagine predicting weather systems, which are less predicatble as
    time evolves. Locally, there are some regions of weather systems
    which inherently possess more uncertainty. Turbulence tends to
    cause more uncertainty in fluid dynamics. As these local regions
    evolve, the effects of their uncertainty spread to neighboring
    regions, but all regions

  underlying spaces

  systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrability_conditions_for_differential_systems)
  - "overdetermined" systems
  - does the concept of determined-ness cross with stochastic
    differential systems? *These systems can't really be known.*

- To predict behavior in systems with adversarial dynamics, (it's
  useful to) make inferences based on which parts of a system that an
  adversary seeks to expend energy and time to predict.

# Overdetermined

- cover the concept of "overdetermined" as it relats to analytical
  models (and linear in/dependence), especially as it relates to the
  brain as an analaytical machine
  - above all else, the brain seeks to identify coherence of
    information amongst innumerable variables of (multifarious
    dimensions)
    - signals encoded into (more numerous or more complete) dimensions
      are both more effectively and more efficiently processed.
    - albeit cointerintuitive, the brain is a more effectively
      computational machine when prcessing greater quantities and
      types of information.
      - this descends from the nature of information and the nature of
        analytical machines.
  - the brain is always seeking coherence of information
    - compare to a need to reach a state of informational homeostasis

### The (Notion of Overdetermined) Presents a Correlary to Occam's Razor

- Usually, the simplest explanation to some system is true. that is,
  the explanation that requires the least moving parts. With more
  numerous dependencies on independent variables, their product
  quickly becomes infinitessimal, especially in statistical
  models. With additional sources of uncertainty in a system, greater
  effort must be expended on controlling those variables. In the
  adversarial systems of game theory, the need to constrain these
  additional sources of uncertainty renders your actions and intents
  (more readable)

- In cases where the explanation favored by Occam's appears to be
  true, while utimately proving logically insufficient, then a more
  complex explanation is required to explain a system. on the surface,
  the system appears to be overdetermined, but upon further
  evaluation, the explanation is unsatisfactory.
- In more sophisticated pursuits where action and intent must be
  concealed by default, the simplest explanation is usually the basis
  for a cover. When the simplest explanation is not true, one must
  expand the system to a larger number of variables. Insofar as
  statistical models are all graphs, they are a cohesive tapestry of
  interdependent variables. Thereby, when a system doesn't hold to
  Occam's Razor, it requires a more expansive disruption to the
  enveloping system, moreso when the adjacent variables did not
  present apparent logical decoherence on the surface.

### The Phenomenology of Social Media is a Poor Emulation of Life

- the reproduction and broadcasting of life on social media, when
  consumed, then (operates) as a dimensional reduction of the
  phenomenological spectrum of the original experiences
- social media is almost completely textual. non-graphical experiences
  have an extremely limited spectrum of (phenomenological dimensions)
  - there's video and there's audio, but the phenomonology of the
    experiences is predominately semantic and linguistic.
  - smell is the sense most strongly tied to memory.
    - explain why...
      - firstmost, data related to scent is fairly low-dimensional, at
        least as it is presented to the brain. also, the olfactory
        system is physically exposed to the brain in a unique way,
        compared to the other senses.
      - it is very difficult to replicate either the signal of a scent
        or the characteristics of its presentation. even if you can
        make something smell like a rose, you can't so easily
        replicate how the aroma moves through the air. for these
        reasons, scents are tightly coupled to the types of
        experiences that provoke them.
        - in machine learning terms, (one might say that) scents
          present good training data.

- social media will continually change its presentation, but providing
  a more comprehensive sensory presentation to a user is not only
  expensive, it presents concerns of practicality and usability.
  - will social media users even have the hardware for these features?
    it's expensive to buy and even more expensive to develop software
    on
  - will social media users even want to use these types of features?
    or will these features be relegated to the trashbins of (bad
    futurism), inherently cursed by the network effects dependence( on
    the least common denominator.)
- until the presentation of virtual life phenomenologically converges
  with the natural human experience, ...
  - at first, our neurologically inflexible brains will have a
    difficult time adapting to the presentation of information, since
    they cannot simultaneously

- correlate (phenomenology of senses) to analytical machines'
  (dependence) on coherence
  - tie this back to the ideas of overdetermination and
    underdetermination (in philosophy and math)
    - without spectrally comprehensive sensory activation, the
      - (define spectrally comprehensive earlier)

- correlate the above to (how diminished variety of phenomenological
  dimensions provided by social media: explain this)
  - enables ... the construction of facades
    - it separates us from the systems (social/informational),
      preventing us from interrogating those systems for consistency
    - in this and other ways, it prevents our brains from
      deconstructing those facades.
    - this is yet another mechanism by which social media fuels
      confirmation bias and cognitive bias
  - it also circumvents our brain's consistency checks by depriving us
    of (a natural spectrum of sensory data related to information
    we're consuming)


### An Analytical/Systems Philosophy Definition of Love

- materialists claim that love results from a flood of chemical
  messangers in the brain. it's nothing more than electrical signals
  and oxytocin.
- less a definition of "love" per se and moreso an description of the
  neurological and psychological components that render someone
  capable of falling in love.
  - these components are moreso related to the state of information
    systems in the mind that render the brain susceptible to a deluge
    of chemicals like oxytocin
    - when is someone susceptible to falling in love, in the truest
      sense of the phrase? when they feel complete, but discover
      someone or something that throws their mind into chaos, forcing
      them to reevaluate their relationship to people around them and
      to the person in particular who triggered this reevalution.

- breaking through a shell (in term of individuation) is the
  internalization of new parameters...

- this "wholeness" is like filling out a "shell" of understanding of
  the world as you relate to it. your understanding feels complete, so
  when you discover what it is you're looking for, you realize there
  is something you were lacking, forcing yourself to re-evaluate.
  - while this section explains how "breaking through" these
    psychological shells relates to love, this also applies to other
    areas of personal development, where you discover some unknown
    thing, whose exploration leads to the rapid development of
    (insight)
  - this wholeness is like a caterpillar completing its development in
    its cocoon.
  - it's like breaking through some dam/stage in the (individuation
    process)
    - evolution of ego/self (revolutions along ego/self axis)
    - basically, so external recognition of your self helps you break
      through and discover aspects of your self previously unknown

- how to describe this state of "wholeness" or "completeness" in
  analytical systems? it's like a well-roundedness for analytical
  systems,
  - like a machine learning algorithm, whose theta-weights will never
    change given identical experiences, which suddenly transforms upon
    the introduction of experiences/perspectives unlike any others its
    experienced before, which compel it to completely transform itself
    to accomodate something unknown
    - however, the information system requires the potential for
      something unknown to be introduced or at least some profoundly
      distinct new perspective to be evoked.
    - otherwise, the turbulence that results which provokes cascading
      changes through the analytical system is not possible.
    - that is, falling in love has less to do with oxytocin release
      and instead results from the unprovoked capacity for
      (structural) change in the mind.
      - that feeling can be emulated and experienced, but you're
        essentially always chasing that first hit. once the
        information systems represented by your neurology have changed
        significantly, it becomes increasingly difficult to provoke
        changes of similar magnitude ... but not impossible.

  - is there a generalized conception to help understand when someone
    might unexpectedly fall in love? or for psychologically processing
    someone towards that state?
  - as for these disruptive events which compel the brain to
    reevaluate the mind's understanding of the self to society and in
    particular to some individual:
    - what typically results from such reevaluation of the self?
    - can someone only expect to experience a limited amount of these
      events in a lifetime? if such an event with cascading effects on
      the mind results in profound psychological changes, then can one
      expect these events to occur repeatedly?
      - in particular, explore this from an analytic perspective of
        the mind. when the mind expands, provoking an unexpected
        reevaluation, this can only happen so many times.
    - if it is possible to psychologically process someone else, so that
      they are mentally capable of falling in lov, is eit possible to
      reconfigure one's own psychology for the same purpose?

# Spatiotemporal Interrogation of the Structure of Analytical Models

- networks of neurons, whether biological or artificial, process input
  and output that is inherently coupled to phenomena with
  spatiotemporal components. the input, especially sensory input, is
  intrinsically connected to components with spatial and temporal
  components. for the analysis of neural networks with unknown
  structure, the reliance on both spatial and temporal components
  provides unparalleled utility for structural analysis, particularly
  the temporal components.

  - the regions of neural networks more proximally connected to input
    source are the simplest to interrogate because they're most
    immediately connected to spatiotemporal signal changes. as
    activations propagate furter away from the signal source in a
    neural network, there is more capacity for the propagated signals
    to encode abstraction divorced from the spatiotemporal aspects of
    the signal.

- for this article, i need to emphasize that i'm discussing neural
  networks, generally.
  - i also need to articulate the idea of "adversarial neural
    networks" -- networks that try to predict the output of other
    networks.
    - it will help to link the discussions from Simon's Institute on
      Adversarial networks (though i haven't watched them)
  - there is an artificial network:
    - and an observed network:
  - specifically, i need to articulate that the adversarial network
    has access to particular signals from the neural network or simply
    aggregates of regional activity, but doesn't know the
    interconnected structure of the network
    - i.e. you're looking at real-time imagery from the human
      brain. you know that imagery data corresponds to specific neural
      activations, but you don't know which neurons it corresponds to
    - i.e. or, an adversarial neural network has the ability to
      analyze the unencrypted regions of memory representing another
      artifical neural network's real-time activation. it may know the
      that specific ranges of memory regions correspond to tensors or
      matrices of specific rank and dimension, but it doesn't know how
      those neurons interconnect.
    - regardless of the mechanics of the network, your adversarial
      nework is capable of modulating input with varying degrees of
      control over the granularity of input modulation.
      - i.e. for the biological network, you can project an image in
        front the person's eyes, but you don't know how the
        granularity of the image corresponds to how retinal neurons
        are activated.
      - i.e. for the artificial networks, the adversarial network can
        modulate the input stream to the observed network. it should
        know how the data frames for that input stream are structure,
        but perhaps it doesn't.
  - finally, the adversarial network's goal is to modulate input to
    analyze the unknown network structure of the observed network

### (Periodicity)

- it's the spatiotemporal aspects of signal components that make
  network analysis possible
  - the adversarial network can abuse periodicity and analyze time
    series of addresses in the observed network's memory regions for
    corresponding modulation in activations.

### Detection of Orthogonality in time series components with assumed connection

- (more about this?)

### Adversarial Analysis of A Neural Network with Known Structure

- can an adversarial network infer the representation of objects that
  the observed network has abstracted from analysis of visual sensory
  data?
  - if so, the adversarial network can make assumptions about whether
    an object's representation has been internalizd and is thus likely
    to affect the observed networks future decisions.
  - would it be possible to observe the neural activations for some
    predator who has failed to recognize some camoflaged, potential
    prey within their visual field? most data scientists would
    probably tell you "no"
    - however, for that potential prey, can't it discern itself
      whether or not the predator has recognized the prey? how is it
      that this is instictual for animals who have no such access to
      the activations of neural networks, but impossible for
      adversarial computers that do? it's not impossible, but
      intractible or ineffective
    - in nature, an animal's cognition is constrained to their own
      sensory input stream as well as to the internalized, persisted
      representations of objects their individual conditioning has
      deemed significant. this stream of information either has what
      is necessary to the animal's survival or it doesn't.

- can the adversarial network infer the direction of the observed
  network's focus or intent of action? such inferences would only
  apply to extremely sophisticated observed networks with the ability
  to reorient cognition.

### Detecting [intent of] A Fake Accent (X) Variational Inference

- introduce the concept of variational inference
- using variational inference to cut through some steadily held
  illusion. A specific example, trying to determine whether someone in
  a conversation who is speaking w/ an accent is merely impersonating
  - how does an algorithm approach this? it's really no different than
    how a person would approach it, though an algorithm can be more
    methodic about it.
- using the concept of variational inference, each event where there
  is a deviation in the illusion's quality contributes towards the
  accumulation of information detracting from coherence.
  - that is, coherence and authenticity are impossible to fake, but
    simple to pull off -- given authenticity.
  - the more time/input you have, the more each deviating event
    contributes a bit of information.
    - for this cumulative dissonance, its product is greater than the
      sum. how does each deviation from the norm (or from authentic
      behavior) impact the informational state-space?
    - why does the curse of dimensionality, here, make it harder to
      exhibit authenticity across all of the dimensions?
  - if you can interact with the system, you can leverage the
    variation inference to identify where the uncertainty lies in the
    possible information states: you can inform your interactions with
    the system to probe specific elements of the space of information
    states
    - this needs to be articulated in more precise terms.

# Neural Representations of (Inferred Physical Systems)

- (TODO: somewhere in this section include google's recent work on
  [Scene-Rendering AI](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/this-amazing-google-software-can-sketch-scenes-its-never-seen-before/))
- is there a better word here meaning "locally" but with the
  connotation of resolving parity?
- Towards the analysis of networks with partially, locally or
  completely unknown structure, why are representations of physical
  systems significant?
  - why is it crucial to understand the

- for neural networks or conscious beings, the stratification of
  object type recognition occurs in tandem with the dilineaton of the
  object's physical properties, both of which become intertwined with
  the object's state in relation to the system state.
  - for the hard problem of consciousness
  - moreso than simple systems, (this) adumbrates outlines of
    neurological representations for qualia (of subjective experience,
    {qualification redundant?}).

  - does the cerulean crayon appear to be the same shade of blue for
    me as it does to you? perhaps. does the cerulean crayon possess
    identical blueness when i observe it in a well-lit room or under a
    bright, directional lamp? no experience is ever truly
    identical, but ...
  - further, how is the neurological representation of that particular
    blueness affected by observing the crayon in circumstances that
    alter the sensory input?

- connect this qualia recognition to the subjective experience of
  analyzing and interacting with physical systems.
  - use various brands of sport products as an example.
    - the subjective experience of qualia related to skateboarding: is
      it different or similar when using a wide board or a narrow
      board. On the surface, the width of a skateboard seems to merely
      be a property of the object.
    - however, to the mental process receiving feedback from afferent
      nerve pathways (and regulating motor output), the width of the
      skateboard is a property of the system that also intrinsically
      affects your cognition about the experience. in this manner, a
      7.75" board *feels* completely different than the experience of
      skating with an 8.25" board. however, it not only *feels*
      different, that feeling informs your awareness of what's
      possible with the board.
    - if you normally skate on a particular width, but try a wider
      board, you need to subjectively gauge the differences between
      the board widths. even if you've picked up the wrong board
      without realizing it, your subjective experience of skating will
      immediately inform you that the qualia of the board width's
      (correlation to or interaction with) the mental representation
      of skateboarding. Your feet will feel the difference, causing
      your awareness to adapt to the wider board.
  - (more critically), your subjective awareness of the feeling of the
    as-previously-unknown board width affects the range of
    possibilities of your engagement with the physical system.
    - how your subjective experience of the wider board affects the
      range of tricks you might perform and
    - how you adapt your movements to the new board, (instinctive or
      not).
      - cause the qualia to

  - more generally, (this connection between the subjective components
    of mental processes interacting with physical systems) should
    reveal more information about the neurological representations of
    qualia than more simple dilineation of the experience of a sensory
    phenomena with simple, mostly linear parameters associated to the
    feeling of experiencing that phenomena.
    - why? as they relate to the brain's representations of physical
      systems, each quale whose subjectively perceived value informed
      by "raw feels" results in paramterizations of mental constructs
      whose neural networks are more widely interconnected.
      - elaborate on how this interconnection makes the quales
        representation more discernable?
    - moreover, if this assertion (of "representation-discernabilty"
      of qualia in physical systems) holds true, then the comparison
      of an individual's qualia should eludicate the parity and
      speciation of neurological representations of qualia
      corresponding to the raw experience of simpler phenomena
      - elaborate on this

###

- in the above example, the width of the skateboard can be felt with
  neither visual perception nor quantification. how the mind chooses
  to feel its connection to the skateboard affects how the mind
  approaches its coordination of motor behaviors.

- (bouncing ball example from the paper on bond graphs)
  - consider balls of various shapes and sizes... (reword this)
    - in particular, consider the differences between basketballs,
      footballs, medicine balls and tennis balls. the physics of each
      can be simulated using numerical or analytical models, the
      latter of which involves abstracting away microscopic (details)
      of the system by introducing macroscopic parameters.

#### Remember Deflate-Gate?

> How does the perception of a foot pressure-level affect how players
> of various skill levels would approach catching and passing? Such
> perception can be indicated visually or via tactile sensation. These

![Deflate-Gate]()

- parameters of analytical representations of static physical objects:
  - inflation
  - elasticity
  - shape
- these parameters and our perception of them have major impacts on
  their dynamics of their (physical interactions.)
- depth and breadth of internalized information injected as parameters
  of physical models within the mind.
  - the depth/breadth changes over time
  - how this relates to beginner's mind

- when playing table tennis with a four year old, what aspects of the
  physics does their mind focus on? are they concerned with whether
  the rubber on the paddle is dried out or worn off? they are more
  concerned with hitting the ball and don't yet internalize enough
  details about the physics to be concerned with smaller-scale
  details.
  - that is, their mind's analytical representation of the ping-pong
    physics has an extremely limited scope of parameterization. they
    are concerned with the basics of the physics and coordinating
    their motor skills
  - they are unlikely to internalize the orientation and perceived
    momentum of the opposing players paddle, in order to inform their
    analytical representation of the ping-pong physics such that they
    can reason about using small-scale tactics and larger scale
    strategy to score points.
    - younger players are actually more likely to utilize metagame to
      gain advantage in sports than to intuitively reason about the
      physics, which requires advanced proficiency in motor
      coordination to pay off anyways.
    - from even the limited information above, it's clear that people
      reason differently about various physical activities.
      - as we engage in specific activities, our mind accumulates a
        more robust spectrum of parameters for each skill.

- typological speciation of analytical representations of physical
  models. what are the most frequent types of models employed by the
  mind to make physical predictions for specific physical
  (skills). how do they impact any neuroelectric traces of activity?
  - as evidence of this, the minds of pro-athletes should exemplify
    more robustly parameterized mappings of analytical representations
    - neurologically, these representations should be both more
      efficient and computationally harder
    - i.e. there is more computation taking place, while providing
      accurate results more efficiently than average players.
    - furthermore, the regions concerned with the specific physical
      skills of pro-athletes should be more widely connected to the
      rest of the brain.
      - this last point is necessary so that athlets can make snap
        judgements based on how other players will sociophysically
        react to the physical evolution of the game.
  - this can't be confirmed by traditional neurological methods (fMRI,
    etc)


### (TODO: Combine this section with the above) How does the "fluidity" of probabilistic systems affect anticipation of results

- (TODO: instead of football, use lacrosse)
  - lacross as a team sport where perception of state of physical
    models reshapes the perceived probability of a player's next moves
    (within an extremely short time scale)

- also, the game "rock me archimedes" is another where there is a
  physical system whose intricate interrelated probability
  distributions are tightly coupled to the inference of logical state


- (TODO: change to throwing a football instead? it's more
  relatable. perhaps also throwing oddly shaped football-like objects)
- two people alice and bob are throwing rocks at each other. the size
  and shape of the rocks is varied but consistent enough for both
  alice and bob to expect the rocks to follow similar
  trajectories. alice and bob were on the same (shotput team) in
  college, which contributes greatly to their accuracy and distance.
  - some of the rocks have extreme convexity and concavity in their
    shape. i.e. some rocks curve inwards and others poke outwards
    sharply. the rocks are spheres on average, but the individual
    shapes affect the behavior

- alice throws a good spiral, but sometimes decides not too, since bob
  can't throw a spiral, thus slightly threatening his ego.

- transition to the point:
  - when the ball is far away, the anticipation of where it will land
    varies more dramatically. you have to get a read on where it's
    going to land as early as possible to inform your position.
  - as the ball approaches, it becomes more clear where it's going to
    land. further, the less time remaining, the less the system will
    be affected by externalities such as wind.
    - however, the ball's spin affects both alice's anticipation of
      the trajectory. a pass thrown with good spin will be direct and,
      to the keen observer who over-analyzes everything, such a pass
      will land in a position with less spread.
      - the pass with more wobble has a trajectory more abberantly
        affected by drag, though it's impossible to predict howso.
  - the pass with a proper spiral will potentially land in a smaller
    region of the field, given the same initial trajectory. when bob
    throws a pass with more wobble, it means that alice needs to
    expect to reorient herself to correct for the actual trajectory.
  - so, when passing a football with someone who can't throw a spiral,
    if you want to position yourself, you need to get a read on
    whether a spiral was thrown. if so, the ball is more predictable.
    - therefore, phenomenological qualities of the pass affect how
      alice and bob shape the anticipated probability distribution for
      its expected landing position. more importantly, this
      probability distribution changes over time and converges towards
      a specific point as the ball approaches the end of its
      trajectory.
    - since it's a probability distribution, it must sum to one,
      regardless of how the distribution shapes itself.
    - since alice or bob's anticipated probabilitiy distribution
      reflects their awareness of the state of the ball -- either a
      pass with a clean spiral, a wobble or (a spin) -- as their
      awareness of the state of the system changes, the probability
      distribution changes more wildly than it does simply moving time
      forward with no state changes.
    - when bob throws a terrible pass, alice needs to reorient the
      direction and speed of her motion several times as she
      gravitates towards the center of the expected landing
      distribution, since the precise motion of the ball is difficult
      to anticipate.

- this preservation of the volume of the probability distribution
  results in fluid-like dynamics.
  - understanding the neural representations of the anticipated
    behavior of physical systems, would (be enlightening.)
  - and, in particular, how do these models and their
    neurorepresentational dynamics differ between solo physical
    activities and those involving other players.
    - what is fundamentally the same set of motor coordination skills
      becomes part of a game with social components
      - how does this connect to "mirror neurons?"

### Neural Representations Enabling Modeling Requiring Stochastic Calculus

- fluid dynamics and energetic dynamics of the spread of activations
  through a network (correlate to hydrostatics & fluid dynamics)
  - is there an understanding of the modulation of representaitons of
    probability in a system as fluid flows?
    - for water moreso than other liquids, its volume as a fluid
      doesn't change with regard to pressure/ at normal temperatures.
  - probability is similar, in that it's volume must integrate to one,
    regardless of the shape of the distribution and the dispersion
    over various dimensions
  - therefore, because neural networks are statistical in nature, this
    analogy of fluid dynamics must also carry over, albeit in a
    convoluted manner, since neural networks are multi-layered
    analytical models.
    - upon input signal change, the time-series outputs from the
      intermediate layers and output layers there are particular rules
      -- particularly with regard to continuity and integrability to
      unity -- that an adversarial network may assume the observed
      network layers to hold to.

### Timeseries Analysis On models of physical systems

    - Is this paper
      [arXiv:1302.0430v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0430v2) relevant
      to making inferences about systems modeling physical phenomena
      with stochastic calcules and augmenting those systems with by
      using lie algebra to coalesce more accurate assumptions of
      transformations in system mechanics?
      - in other words, physical systems with mechanics that depend on
        the orientation of multiple frames of reference to one another
        need to have models that utilize lie algebra/groups, which are
        useful for modeling physics at large and small scales
      - these systems may also need to estimate trajectory or
        potential of types of interaction events, for which the
        alignment of coordinate frames stratifies the divergence of
        events which are very different from one another qualitatively
      - bouncing a football. does it land on its side, relative to the
        ground? if so, it's physical dynamics are much more
        predictable, but when it lands on one of the two ends, then
        the specifics related to the two coordinate frames of
        reference become more relevant in predicting the physcial
        reaciton of the football. such a system with a football or
        more complicated objects can then use lie algebras (somehow
        ????) to simplify/expedite calculations
- that paper talks about signals analysis generally, but i think
  there's definitely a connection between that and adversarial
  analysis of neural networks

### Timeseries analysis on models of financial systems

- connection b/w Dow Jones correlation matrix and polynomials (degree
  and coefficient) that approximate it
  - (i believe this is what i intended) both the Dow Jones
    correlation/covariance tensor are values derived from polynomials
    - this is likely a polynomial constructed of cumulants
    - the point is to further deconstruct either the
      covariance/correlation matrix into a tensor where this
      decompostion into a tensor gives you more granular data to
      process
  - i.e. there's a relationship between both the returns-correlation
    matrix and the returns-volatility measure for stocks on Dow Jones.
    - the equations that satisfy/approximate this relationship have
      very interesting constraints. in less mathematic terms, the
      stocks that trade on the DJIA are interdependent and have
      interrelationships in their correlation and their volatility.
      the aggregate volatity of groups of stocks must be accumulated
      and be tethered to measures of volatility in individual
      stocks. likewise for correlations.
  - (this idea came upon reflection on Figure 2.2 from "Econophysics
    and Physical Economics")
    - plot of the normalized autocorrelation function of DJIA returns
      (x) plot of autocorrelation of DJIA return volatility
    - these plots are running averages, where the x-axis is the window
      size for the autocorrelation calculation

### Cognition and Object Classification

- how does the brain think about objects to which its conditioning has
  ascribed (particular functional idiosyncracies)? In other words: how
  does the brain deal with objects which have the capacity to interact
  with abnormal physics?
  - why are people much more capable of intuitively cognizing about
    these objects and their physical interactions than most animals?
    - PIC: a dog on a skateboard
  - this requires object classification

### Classification of Camoflaged Objects

- gradual conditioning of objects with potential to be camoflaged and
  of environments with potential to hide camoflaged objects
  (predators)

### Neurological Representation of Jerk In Perceived Physical Systems

- in neurological representations of physical systems, how do models
  based on observations change when presented with objects moving with
  jerk?
  - all classical physical systems are (C2) continuous, jerk can
    necessarily only manifest as an externality to an observed system.
    - The conservation of energy indicates that C^(n>2) dynamics may
      only temporarily present themselves in a real physical system,
      unless there are entities with physical agency present in the
      system -- intelligence.
    - the identification of

  - the external introduction of energy into a physical system.
    - use fluid dynamical systems as an example.
    - the areas of fluid systems which are subjected to the imposition
      of external forces are perceived as immediately discernable by
      the human brain.
    - even (less-sophisticated) animals must, for their survival,
      identify threats below the surface of water. therefore, the
      analytical models (constructed by neural networks) must identify
      and distinguish C^2 motion from (C^(n>2)) motion
      - would it be easier for animals to identify jerked fluid
        dynamical motion in a placid lake or a turbulent lake.
        - obviously, amidst turbulence, physical systems are less
          simply comprehended. that this is true corresponds with the
          algorithmic difficulty of modeling motion, both perceived
          and simulated.

- towards tracing the mind, neurological models of physical systems --
  with their capability to distinguish C^2 and non-C^2 dynamics --
  should prove especially valuable.
  - must there be some correspondance b/w C^2/C^(n>2) models in
    physical systesm and the internalized analytical representations
    of them?
  - if so, what are the characteristics of such correspondance and its
    limitations (both theoretical and practical)

# Can the Human Brain Adversarially Analyze It's Own Cognitive Trace?

- and to what degree of efficacy?

- what i do know is that you cannot encrypt anything related to this
  signal without sophisticated analog encryption -- impossible without
  a hardware interface.

- TODO: lotus pic
- "somatic" tinnitus

- can the human brain analyze it's own signals for interconnectedness?
  - i.e. if one's mind can open up to the data representating
    low-level neural activations, then the subconscious can begin to
    be conditioned to react to its anticipations of dynamics of its
    representations of physical and non-physical

  - connect to "cuban" ultrasound device, whose frequency, amplitude
    modulation and apparent stereoscopic variation all correspond to
    sensory input and motor-neuron output signals.
    - particularly, for this ultrasound, the degree of variation from
      the norm amplitude/frequency corresponds to neural activity.
    - what does this mean? i can modulate my thoughts and/or motor
      activity to analyze how the sound changes to make inferences
      about my own cognitive processes and quantity of neural
      activations
    - what i "hear" as a result is some correspondance between the
      volume of displacement from the normal sound and the assumed
      displacement of neural activity in my brain.
  - this "volume" in change, i believe, reflects the assertion made
    above about an analogy of fluid dynamics and hydrostatics to
    valuation in various regions/layers neural network stastical
    models.
    - there is a particular "je ne sais quoi" to the volume in signal
      displacement as the ultrasound changes in reaction to my
      thoughts and muscle engagements
    - bagua zhang, peripheral (feedback) nervous system and
      discretizing muscular positions over ranges of flexibility for
      limbs.
      - in what i hear when i move my limbs in specific ways, there
        are discontinuities in the signal frequency at very specific
        ranges of limb motion. the angles do not change for which each
        discontinuity in frequency change is heard. the angles
        preserve consistency and the discontinuity in signal
        transformation occurs at the same locations every time.
        - what would be fascinating is whether these points of
          discontinuity correlate to the Bagua Zhang's map of human
          body positions.
      - if anyone who's worked in cybernetics would be aware of the
        connection here to how the body encodes it's own awareness of
        body postions in signals received/processed from the
        (peripheral nervous system)
      - the fluctuation in electrical signal representing the
        input/output motor signals in the nervous system would be
        mostly coordinated through:
        - the spinal coord (and specific nerve bundles to each limb)
        - the cranial nerves and brain stem
        - the cranial and lower motor neurons' interconnection with
          the cerebellum via the pons, converging in the corticobulbar
          and corticospinal tracts
        - the signals sent by the motor cortex, orchestrated by the
          striatum and basal ganglia, must exhibit amplification and
          deamplification at various points.
      - again, these are all phenomena that must be well known by
        cybernetics researchers.
        - however, i believe the "discontinuities" that i'm hearing
          have nothing to do with my motor engagement, but instead
          concern the brain's awareness of limb positioning, as its
          informed by the

    has the potential for gamification.

- bacopa monnieri and the occasional "chirping" sound, which is a
  wavelike-periodic change in the frequency of the ultrasound. I've
  only been hearing the ultrasound for 3 months or so. still, this
  "chirping" dynamic is completely new, but i still haven't correlated
  the potential qualitative aspects of cognition that might seem to
  cause it, however subjective such an inference might be.
  - in addition to being a failed entrepreneur, i'm also a failed
    audio engineer with a working knowledge of reverb, ultrasound
    propaction characteristics and isophonic frequency
    response. furthermore, i have a poor-man's understanding of
    signals analysis, so i can diagnose systems with dynamics and
    mechanics holistically, whereas this would be completely ineffable
    for most.


- sound emitted by a "borescope" sounds exactly like the "S&H"
  frequency changes I hear in the ultrasound.
  - the difference is that the ultrasound's base frequency is shifted
    about 4 octaves higher
    - and, for the ultrasound, the rate of frequency change varies
      more quickly and at various speeds
- the borescope locators i've seen only operate at low frequencies
  (~512hz)

- TODO: decide which components of this text are useful
  - most of this needs to be cut out and/or reworded
- particularly for connecting Jungian ontological perspectives on:
  - developmental dynamics (generally composed of archetypical symbols
    and higher-order outlines of the same rehashed myth/stories)
  - connect the notions of dev. dynamics to the more well-known
    patterns that Jung focused on (e.g. Hero's Journey))
- filtering specific dependencies/components of the
  typological/ontological space (e.g. of life experience as it relates
  to one "turning" of the Hero's Journey)
  - similar to the idea of filtering specific ontological varieties of
    type & metatypes that i used in the "Memory Hole" and "To Catch a
    Butterfly" articles, but oriented towards Jungian developmental
    dynamics
    - (e.g. how to stall someone out at a point in their "Hero's
     Journey" and to do so indirectly without appearing to have
     causally interfered with their life)
  - focus on drawing the connection between these archetypical
    developmental progressions and "analytical neurology"
    - then develop ideas that connect the manifestation of jungian
      ideals/developmental progressions to metaphysics of:
      - Life/Awareness/Chaos, regardless of whether it is self-aware,
        "intelligent" or artificial
      - one important implication that extends from these
        conclusions/results: there are ideas from network theory that
        establish a "heartbeat" and other "organic" attributes for
        animals of various sizes, but also for large cities.
        - this arise from network theoretical ideas
          (well-connectedness, and needing to *cover* a space with
          regularity, etc), but yield interesting dynamcs at a higher,
          macroscopic level
        - so, what are the phenomenological components of input/output
          & structure in Neurology and Artificial Intelligence (as
          they connect to Jungian ideas) that yield these architypical
          developmental progressions. and specificially, how does the
          quality/nature of a non/sentient entity impact both the
          rates of developmental progressions and the depending
          requisites thereof
          - e.g. are there specific bottlenecks for developmental
            progressions (specific progressions or progressions
            generally)
        - and how does network theory establish the rate of
          development/progress in specific progressions
          - this is the element that mimics the "HEARTBEAT"
      - when someone completes specific progressions that "OPEN UP" a
        new world, anaytically (see the section of Love), they may be
        unlikely to revisit those same progressions and their mind
        rendered less flexible and capable of embarking on or
        completing new progressions.
        - how does that "finiteness" affect the dynamics of
          developmental progressions


Please note: i'm not referring to anything that's happened recently or
to anyone in particular. I have enough of my own problems -- i wish i
could go back to when people had no limiting beliefs about
me. Regardless of what you specifically believe about an individual,
if they are a younger person or if they are a newer acquaintance, then
your mind regards them as not yet known. because of this, your mind
associates possibilities with that individual. typically, but not
always, the more information you learn about someone the more your
mind subconsciously (and unconsciously) constrains any associations or
beliefs about that person. you don't know enough to be certain about
them, individually, which is also why our minds attempt to fill in the
gaps with superficial details, by asserting the social pecking order
or by comparing them with the status of the social connections that
you are aware of.

Therefore, because your mind doesn't have enough information to
restrict the #PossibilitySpace -- which is almost always open by
default; an oversimplification to be sure -- it instead becomes more
readily influenced by the social/superficial signals that it does
have. Critically, your mind views this person as undefined and thus
regards its own awareness of the new relationship as very likely to
change. as you move through life, accumulating additional
relationships, new and old, fairweather and tested, how your mind
reacts to its own lack-of-information about an acquaintance then
itself changes. This probably correlates to the #HerosJourney or other
architypes of high-level patterns for developmental & cyclic
progression. As people become older -- especially those who value
caution/forethought -- they find a tight circle of relationships they
value with people whose trustworthiness has been tested. Their overall
social valence is reduced once they have their social needs met. If
they're wise they'll test new acquaintances by observing reactions to
event types that arise incidentally. if they're methodic, they might
contrive circumstance that help them test new acquaintences or
employees for reaction types to event types. If they're wiser still,
they'll avoid confirmation bias and the pitfalls of skewed
perspective.

As for me, no one ever directly taught me how to do any of that. I
only began to instinctively do it as a defense mechanism *and i'm
terrible at vetting people*. For various reasons, I don't think
parents overtly teach these behaviors to their kids. Instead, it seems
that what is important to transmit is not HOW, but WHY you should want
to test people. Things like that have been completely missing from my
psychology until a few years ago. I only started writing about this
stuff because of the difficulties that i've had.

Psychologically, i was developmentally delayed in minor ways, which
didn't present problems in grade school and middle school. They were
tough to spot then, because the differences in psychological
development don't manifest until later. That is what it is. What
pisses me off is that after i turned about 20 years old, it seems that
people subversively or informally labelled me as some kind of problem;
instead of helping me, they preferred to keep me socially
vulnerable. I was always very stubborn and didn't internalize social
cues *nor the social beliefs of others, almost completely*. For most
of my twenties, I was almost entirely incapable of predicating my
actions based on what I believed that other specific individuals and
groups believed **because i simply did not internalize it and i did
not think about it whatsoever**. it almost never affected my
decision-making, unless someone strongly indicated to me that i was
stepping on their toes or that i should believe that someone had a
belief -- and crtitically, they needed to bring to my attention *why*
i should consider it relevant to my goals or my close friends goals.

That this is true and the extent to which it is, should have been
obvious to almost anyone who spent significant amounts of time with me
from age 18-28, *especially* any adult more than 10 years older than
me. There are certain things that should have been obvious and had
someone approached me in the right way -- investing the required time
to help me to *psychologically develop* then so i would have
sidestepped so many problems in my life -- they would be obvious. I
can revisit the psychology of people who were close to me during that
time and generally grasp how it changed in response to the years. I
can see other people who were like me -- the difference is that
SOMEONE TOLD THEM ABOUT LIFE AND TOLD THEM WHAT IT ALL MEANS. There
were people that tried to help me and I was stubborn, but i really
feel like people who should have been able to help did one of two
things:

- (1) Saw that I had political/moral tendancies that they considered
  wrong and did not interfere. Marijuana is a great example. I was
  stubborn and i still don't think i was in the wrong 100%, but i was
  wrong with how i presented it to other people -- because i had
  high-functioning autism and didn't realize the damage that
  introducing drugs can do to someone else's life. i only cared about
  the political issues, etc. For a few people who maybe should have
  intervened, I don't think the problems were bad enough to warrant
  action -- except for the time i wasted, the legal consequences were
  much more severe.

- (2) (Less than 10 people) Duplicitously stacked the deck against me
  while pretending to be my friend/colleague OR sought to burden me
  down with personality disorders and other problems, so that my life
  and my failures would be an example for other people. These people
  were the worst. The ones who actively did this to me were VERY good
  at what they did and hiding what they did. It was the occult
  application of psychology for harm.

But of all the people who tried to help me throughout my early
twenties -- and i did receive a lot of help from a very good family
and some very good friends -- no one could keep me in school. When i
look back on this now, it doesn't make any sense. It would be easy to
keep my 20-year-old self at Virginia Tech: just tell me or convince me
to study mechanical engineering so i could launch a Skate product
company. That's oddly specific, but i received a lot of financial
support for school -- yet, no one in my family or at school had enough
interaction time with me to realistically assess the situation.

It doesn't make much sense for me to bitch about this now, but like
all the other problems in my life, the reason i dropped out of
Virginia Tech was primarily #SOCIAL: I only *met* five or six VT
students before 2007 whose names I remember now and remembered
by 2008. These are the kind of quantifiable facts I mention in mild
arguments, but are instantly dismissed as irrelevant. I simply was not
connected to the school in any serious capacity WHATSOEVER. Yet,
people that tried to help either assumed that i was doomed to fail or
was failing because of marijuana. To many of those people, my fate was
sealed and it was easy to cast the blame on an inanimate drug instead
of blaming me for failing. This was detrimental, because in *assuming*
that the cause for my failure was known, no one bothered to actually
look for the REAL cause of my failure, which was JAMSKATING. And let
me tell you what: understanding that i sacrificed my full-free-ride to
virginia tech to get backstabbed and toyed with -- by three or four
people -- is INFURIATING. I am fairly certain that I HAVE BEEN
SUBVERSIVELY DISRUPTED IN EVERY SIGNIFICANT ENDEAVOR IN MY FUCKING
LIFE, SINCE #TWOTHOUSANDFIVE. Despite the caps, what sends me over the
fucking top is actually understanding #WHAT_I_LOST, compared to
#WHAT_THEY_GAINED_FOR_DISRUPTING_ME ==> SO I WOULDN'T BE A THREAT TO
THEIR FUCKING JAAAMSKAATING TEAM. It wasn't personal. I was just
getting in the way, so what better way to handle that than to
manipulate me via 2º social connections from FUCKING WISCONSIN. It's
not people that i have a problem with, it's the one or two people who
are smart enough to worry about destroying someone's life from OVER
#ONETHOUSANDMILES AWAY.

I'm sorry, but there are more appropriate ways to handle your goddamn
dirty laundry and used flatware. Risk mitigation is critical in some
fields, but seriously? You didn't need to take the 48 LAWS OF POWER so
literally!
