- consensus on policy, operations & interface (w public, governed,
  etc)
- summarizing many of my philosophical ideas in one word that
  addresses and balances metamodernism: finalism

misc
===========

- terminology:
  - settle on clear distinctions b/w governance, government, etc
    (governmental) so that it's more general. this connects to social
    systems of any size, but especially to those systems with
    well-defined rules (for....)
  - clearly distinguish resource from resource type from an
    instantiation of a resource type
  - information economics terminology
  - common knowledge

- fluid dynamics
  - viscocity
  - turbudity
  - LCD terminology

- [Open Source Governance
  Models: From BDFL to Consensus Seeking](http://www.nodesummit.com/prior-video/node-summit-2017-open-source-governance-models-from-bdfl-to-consensus-seeking-myles-borins/)
  - Governance in business: management, internally/externally facing
    policy, board of directors.


- financial/social/informational resource types =>
  financial/social/informational economics
  - this may simplify some discussion

### Ebb & Flow between Order/Chaos, Stability/Change in Geopolitics/Geoeconomics

- those who benefit from some geopolitical or geoeconomic order are
  compelled to maintain that order; those who don't benefit or suffer
  as a consquence will try to disrupt it
- Those who establish orders of global significance learn to
  anticipate such disruption generations into the future by learning
  from history. Rome and other empires are good examples, but each
  built an understanding of stabalizing mechanisms from how their
  nascent, preimperial leaders understood each civilization's
  mistakes.
  - For Rome, innovations like aquaducts/etc allowed the empire to
    flexibly position cities/towns so they were decoupled from
    geographic features, which may not be economically or militarily
    optimal. road systems optimized key logistical processes for trade
    & military purposes. this afforded Rome many stabalizing
    advantages.
  - the ideas behind anti-fragility describe the architecture of any
    system which gains stability by transforming turbulence into
    system structures. every difficult event causes the system to
    adapt mechanisms for handling that type of recognized/experienced
    problem. This is possible since s/phys systems are not bound by
    equilibrium dynamics of purely physical systems.
  - the more stabalizing mechanisms, the better. generally, the
    development of options for handling growth, reinvestment and
    stabalization increased the lifetime of the empire. empires have
    always been born, fated and doomed by:
    - commincation (esp. speed)
    - economics & potential for growth
      - factors of resource constraints (like those in conflict
        theory)
      - particularly, managing inflation and fiat currency
        - its basis, perpetuation and protection
    - qualities of transportation
    - the perpetuated strength of the culture
    - the rate of realized geopolitical growth and long-term
      management of geoeconomic growth
    - the rate of population expansion, of various classes of citizens
      "inside" the empire and those on the "outside", combined with
      the motivations/expectations of each
    - the control over belief/confidence, but also the utility of
      belief systems in serving the people
  - ultimately, empires rise and fall based on how they retain/project
    strength by redistributing gains to the people. empires are like
    (slow-growing) pyramid schemes: they take from they outside and
    distribute to the inside. if their don't serve the interests of
    their subjects -- or some external influence causes people within
    the empire to become disillusioned, it spreads like a slow poison
    from generation to generation. the people lose the power they
    gained by focusing their energy. this usually happens as a
    paradoxical consequence of prosperity and relief from
    constraint. the people whose empire gradually crumbles no longer
    remember what made them great.
    - of course, the world order of today's empires are distinguished
      from that of previous centuries in that a chaotic change in
      world order may lead to apocalyptic scenarios. there is no
      progression of rise and fall which is acceptable. some systems
      are perpetuate by shielding themselves from adverse
      events/dynamics yielding unacceptable risks or losses. however,
      when perpetuate themselves by (placing themselves or the
      connected sub/systems) dangerously out of balance, than when a
      correction occurs, (the consequences may be magnified.) this is
      potential (existential paradox) of outlawing minor conflict
      (aggression) and instituting progressive norms/institutions in
      international relations.
      - (link to argument in caelis ruissent)

### What distinguishes today's power centers from ancient civilizations?

- why did civilization collapse repeatedly in the ancient world?
  - the biggest example seems to be 11th century BC, before the notion
    of systemic collapse could have been known?

- it seems to be caused by a dynamic between ruling class and the
  people, both within and outside of their civilization. when a empire
  rises without a plurality of surrounding competing interest, perhaps
  potential empires in their own right, that would unquestionably rush
  in should this empire's levee break -- then the ruling class in such
  a society feels no need to take on such risks as the people's
  development of technology. instead, the ruling class understands how
  to operate within the status quo and sees no immediate external
  threats justifying development of technology and distribution of
  power.
  - until global population would expand to reach such a point, then
    each isolated civilization to emerge atop the intersection of
    geoeconomic leylines would rise and rise, until like the Tower of
    Babel, it's growth would outpace its stability. growth problems
    are usually good to have, but can be lethal to your corporation or
    nation if not accounted for beforehand. running an empire or
    interoperating with one requires geographic distribution of power,
    especially before telecommunication.
    - each significant delegation of power is a potential threat
      tomorrow -- such delegation is a two way street and both parties
      are aware of the benefits and risks, today and tomorrow.
  - so until humanity had experienced the rise and fall of
    civilization after civilization, then none would emerge to be
    geoeconomically stable enough for the pursuit of rationalism,
    modernism and globalism.
    - another mechanism: history's lack of experience to provide a
      social memory that gives civilization a resilience to systemic
      faults.
    - another mechanism: the development of rationalism as a stable
      basis for pursuit of objective progress, to which confidence in
      objectivity and progress can be universally demonstrated.

### Permeability of Individuals to Information

- how individuals' permeability to information changes with age
  - further, the number of generations living simultaneously in a
    society affects the typology of social interactions, globally
  - the viscocity of information exchanged between them is affected by
    intergenerational dynamics
  - experience tends to (petrify) internalized information systems. as
    people age, they accumulate a greater variety of experiences to
    draw on. this tends to reinforce the analytical systems our brains
    process.

### Life Expectancy and Dynamics of Intergenerational Social Influence

- when the number of generations simultaneously alive contracts,
  expands or is otherwise systematically impacted, it im
  pacts the
  mechanics, dynamics and frequencies of the typology of
  intergenerational social interactions.
  - consider alzheimer's disease. if the rates of alzheimers or
    disease progression timelines were to increase, what macroscopic
    effects would that have on social interactions?
  - japan's life expectancy is 85 years. for nation's whose life
    expectancy is a decade or two less, how does that affect how
    individuals of various generations influence each other?
  - over the next decades, as the average life expectancy crosses 100
    years and then 120 years, how are intergenerational dynamics
    impacted systemically

###

- a discussion in Plato's Republic concerns the perhaps cyclic
  progression of governmental forms
  - what were the factors Plato/Socrates listed as driving this
    progression?
  - how does this description intersect with a total generalization of
    governance?

### Already becoming communist without even understanding why

- We're already gravitating closer to Communism or other totalitarian
  systems of governance. Why?
  - Social media is prepping us to have tightly regulated social
    resources. Social media must quantifies social interaction, so
    that algorithms can influence it. At the moment, there is no over
    ideological bent to how Facebook regulates social interaction, but
    we are creating many of the same tools to do so, accompanied by
    the cultivation of social responses to the ubiquity of data-driven
    social manipulation.
    - These social responses include economic responses -- SEO and
      more behavioral responses where groups collectively work
      together to manage their own social resources not unlike how
      commercial groups facilitate commerce of financial
      resources. When people organize around a facebook group and use
      the community for the benefit of the admins, they are
      facillitating commerce of social resources.
    - Other social responses include the development of beliefs,
      social norms and the reflections of each -- i.e. beliefs about
      norms, norms of belief, beliefs about belief, etc.
    - Society is adapting to the changes in viscosity of resources: of
      social-type, financial-type and informational-type. The systems
      are fast-evolving and complex; they don't so simply permit those
      on the inside from understanding how the systems are changing.
  - At the same time, mechanisms for value accumulation, storage and
    commerce that involve primarily financial resources will become
    less viable. This will pace economic problems; as liquidity
    becomes scarce and the distribution of economic opportunities
    becomes more restricted, this eliminates savings as a store of
    value and generally makes financial resources less accessible. The
    result is that people will gravitate towards the commerce of
    influence using what is available and less viscous: social and
    informational resources, but we will find those are difficult to
    exchange as well.

- therefore, our societal and governmental systems will approach the
   zenith of totalitarian configuration, regardless of the nominal
   ideology its supporters rally behind or what anyone names it in the
   end.

main outline
===========

- this is a collection of notes that have accumulated. These seek to
  generalize systems of governance by decontructing (any instantiation
  of a system of government) in terms of how that entity and its
  (citizens) relate to three (most general) sociophysical resource
  types. specifically insofar as how they:
    - initially accumulate
    - preserve and acquire
    - interact with
    - attempt to control
    - provide networked access to
    - etc.

- think of any implementation of some given ideology or an ism,
  disdained or self-proclaimed. imagine perhaps some fantasy realm's
  theocracy, a group of tribal leaders with influence over regional
  families, or even your precariously unstable junta whose
  revolutionary leadership suffers constant flux.

- for all governmental systems, modeling the mechanics/dynamics of
  society's projection of influence onto three sociophysical resource
  types (dilineates systems of governance ontologically), producing
  measures of correspondence between the sociophysically modeled
  system and the systems studied in political science.
  - overly complicated? inaccurate?
    - i'm not sure the average person would immediately appreciate why
      this is useful. or why it's distinct from "political science
      crossed with data"

- however constructed, if the methods of construction are (effective,
  sufficiently general and clearly connected/clustered around the
  ontological forms of governmental systems defined in political
  science), then one framework can connect all forms of governance.
  - (what does/not make such a system possible) is far less
    interesting than how the interrelations between systems are
    useful,
  - this ontological map of governmental systems connects ... (this
    was kinda important)

- (these three primary sociophysical resources, whose characteristics
  are fundamental and whose implications resound into the
  inter-institutional edifices of that society.)

- financial, social, informational resources and an overview on how
  all forms of government/society can be dilineated based on how they
  control/disseminate (diffuse) these resources

### What are these general Sociophysical Resource Types?

- social resources
- financial resources
- informational resources (which encompass the previous two types)
  - since all social/financial interactions produce information and
    are determined by information's influence on behavior

- multiple simple examples of each resource type

- what are the kernels of these resource types?
  - they are informational:
    - information necessary for finance
    - that necessary for social (...)
    - that necessary for the acquisition and development of knowledge,
      which is solely informational
  - how does understanding these kernels empower individuals to become
    affluent in influencing financial, social and informational
    resources?
    - what are the minimal levels of knowledge required for each? how
      do we construct institutions in society for
      propagating/inculcating knowledge of the three?
      - what are the institutions for development of knowledge of
        social resources?
        - religious institutions, belief systems, families, etc.
        - some of these are more effective than others.


- ok that is what it is. there are resources, some people have them,
  some lack them. this is straightforward.

- reflect on this quote from Twilight of the Idols...

> Things the Germans Lack

- what's less straightforward than the (possession/etc) of resources
  in proportion to the people around you is...
- for various groups and institutions in society, their patterns of
  resource utilization (for resources of these types in relation to
  those of other resource types)
  - and critically (their projection influence onto resources of a
    type) comes at the expense of "spending in the other direction" --
    though not so simply as to be additive or linear.
  - (for groups whose potential energy gives them relative complete
    dominance over other groups in their domain), it is the projection
    of influence and (intentional orientation) thereof that causes
    less dominant groups to respond *economically* by orienting their
    projection of influence toward unchallenged less resistant
    (pathways or conduits of influence) ... uhg rewrite this

### Viscocity of Sociophysical Resource Exchange

- that is, any arbitrary system of governance establishes (in/formal)
  processes that prioritize the direction of that system's (potential
  authority/influence) towards instantiations of the three resource
  types, with "preference" towards some types over others.
  - however, for individuals and small social groups, the projection
    of influence by dominant groups effectively stagnates many of the
    potential (conduits) for exchange of social, financial,
    informational. If the smaller players are to reap greater gains
    from the expenditure of sociophysical resources, then they
    seek less resistant routes of influence-exchange.
    - Thus, trends emerge where the people respond unconsciously to
      the state's direction of power by investing their sociophysical
      resources to what provides or allows for freedom. From the
      channels of exchange for sociophysical resources, this freedom
      is the ability to move both yourself and your resources, without
      the imposition of resistance, along open sociophysical channels
      of exchange -- financial, social or informational.
    - when dominant powers impose their interests, rules and norms
      onto the shared sociophysical fabric of exchange, drag in the
      motion along the threads in that fabric generally render
      (ineffectual) self-directed motion

- This results in the tendancy for a government to focus on a primary
  and secondary resource type. The channels of exchange for these two
  types are relatively viscous, leaving the channels of the third type
  less viscous
  - 6 permutations of priotization of control, but to simplify, focus
    on the three types, distinguished by the primary mechanisms set
    to: financial, social and informational. i.e. what does it imply
    when each is the channel with highest viscosity?
    - correlate this to the formula for physical viscosity. viz. what
      is the S.I. quantity in physical fluids that causes viscosity?
    - how does viscosity lead to stagnation of mutation rates for:
      - finanical channels of exchange (and social/informational)
  - herein, can mechanisms of all types become stagnated?
    - if so, what does this mean for the common person's experience in
      such a governmental system?
  - when financial exch. mech. exhibit the greatest stagnation, this
    reduces the "turnover rates" for financial control
  - when social exch. mech. exhibit the greatest stagnation,
    similarly, this leads to perpetuated social hierachies
  - when informational exchange mechanisms exhibit the greatest
    stagnation, this leads to suppression of memetic mutation rates

- explain how diffeomorphic analysis of spaces enables digital video
  processing, but also applies to any topological spaces, even the
  topology of the metaphysical.

- when it appears that social/financial channels will become viscous,
  people have the option to retreat into informational resources. they
  can manipulate/optimize the state of [common knowledge]() by trying
  to harmonize the distribution of key types of information.
  - this enables people to work together after social/financial
    channels are (prohibitively viscous), without the need to
    communicate
  - *at least some solutions* to the [two generals problem]() require
    the establishment/propagation of knowledge about communication
    protocols **before** the need arises to communicate.
    - totalitarian movements anticipate this (without the need for
      s/phys theories or terminology) but the crackdown on exchange of
      information is a signal people will definitely feel, at least
      indirectly, before they lose the ability to stand up.
    - when people shift into informational resources for this reason,
      they do so by: extending myth, creating pattern languages,
      communicating in unpredictable ways, pulling their social circle
      tighter, trying to harmonize information containing rules for
      protocols of communication, etc
  - there can also be less-extreme motivations for harmonizing
    informational resources.
    - e.g. when savings-rates are low, if people are poor, they may
      respond by shifting towards social channels to exchange
      influence. but if the knowledge of how to do so is limited, then
      the resulting information economics are supply-bound.
    - e.g. when obsolescence of norms/traditions/incentivization
      rapidly accelerates, the existing distributed information
      becomes less relevant, requiring social exchange to adjust to
      cultural changes. Cultural evolution to recent technological
      advancement is the most impactful example of this dynamic.
      - here, informational/social economics have changed, since those
        who are less socially connected to the change tend to adapt
        less quickly. in these periods, the economics of financial
        resources will also likely change as a result.
      - those who are more connected to relevant information for how
        to leverage or interface with the cultural changes have
        significant social/financial advantages as a result.
      - with accelerating/decelerating obsolescence, the state of
        [common knowledge]() (esp. that which is still valid) will
        usually tend to decohere (according to mechanics of economics
        of information which determine rates of replication and
        thereby supply...
        - TODO: more precise terms for info economics here; much of
          this discussion depends on details of how specifics are
          stated. (e.g. how to define an "obselete" piece of
          information? or, better, how to define information widely
          distributed enough to be considered common knowledge, but
          which is not "erased from common knowledge" per se, but is
          no longer relevant? ... perhaps rates of
          reference/replication of information in common knowledge,
          but those have their problems)
        - epistemological dynamics impacting the most widely
          distributed information/norms (esp. those which confer
          advantage) .... how can these result to changes in the
          distribution/utility of useful knowledge?
        - how people view value/utility of pieces of information
          determines whether they choose to replicate it. but when
          anticipation/expectation surrounding knowledge becomes
          unclear (as the section on expansion/contraction of kantian
          category of anticipated epistomological dynamics discusses)
          then the valuation of information (it's "pricing") may
          become incredibly distorted, as would other aspects of
          information economics

- the *state* of [common knowledge](), as it applies to the content
  below (i.e. neo-kantian perspective on epistemology)

- (diffeomorphically, of the three configurations above), the
  viscosity of informational resources is the most interesting, from a
  neo-kantian perspective on epistemology. when the idea of kantian
  categories are applied to nascent developments in the structures of
  knowledge, then from this lens, the (opening/developing) paths
  forward are considered.
  - when this lens is (clouded), then the futuristic anticipations of
    the future that diffuse (popularly) into that society become
    anachronistic -- and often humorously so.
  - when such a lens is clear and widely propagated by thought
    leaders, then the surface of impending scientific, academic and
    phenomenological developments becomes well known.
    - two examples of this happening:
      - (1) western civilization's propulsion towards the inevitability of
        modernism from the 17th through the early 20th centuries.
        - explain this a bit.
        - examples: the rockefellers and gas/oil investment versus
          investment in eletrical infrastructure and the technological
          devleopments thereof
          - Before Tesla's development of alternating current, for
            General Electric and other magnates of industry, the
            unfurling of electronic technological development into
            industry was to be slow and controlled. (They) saw no
            other way to package infrastructure implementation and
            delivery of electricity to consumers by direct current,
            which starkly limited
          - The early telecom industry did, however, seem to foresee
            the development of digital technologies, eventually,
            though they greatly misestimated the complexity of
            electronics required
      - (2) never again, would this lens (reverberate with clarity) in
        the minds of thought leaders -- until the era of the internet,
        which set humanity on its current course to rapidly our
        cognizance of (nascent development),
        - where the tools of data science have became democratized,
          this neokantian aperture continues to widen, until no doubt,
          there is no more developments humanity alone will be capable
          of realizing.
        - present day applications of neokantian diffeomorphic
          analysis of epistemic structures: the fields of
          - patent data science (expand on patent data science)
          - biotech investments

- trichotomous

- (... segue) to the design of the system, second-order effects may be
  unintential, but can be critical to the system's intended function,
  whether its (participants or designers) are cognizant of those
  secondary effects. (especially true of less-formally defined systems
  of governance)

### These resources form a kind of Triumvirate

- this and the definitions of resources need to be introduced earlier.
- introduce the notion of triumvirate before/after discussing (..types
  in relation to other types)

- usually, the governmental system seeks to control two of these
  resource types

- as the senses were dilineated phenomenologically by plato, each
  sense is shown to be distinct in their presentation to the mind
  (etc..)
  - similarly, there are fundamental differences between resources of
    each type.

### Mandala Theory (X) Unified Ontological Theory of Governance

- what does it mean for interactions between neighbors of various
  types of governance systems?
  - i am likely to compete with my neighbor, my neighbor is likely to
    compete with me and it's neighbors, but to develop independence
    from local resource constraints, then if i cooperate with my
    neighbor's neighbors, i am likely to find that the adversary of my
    adversaries presents useful mechanisms of influence in political
    theory
  - geopolitically and economically, how do these insights extrapolate
    in the context of specific compositions for local governmental
    systems?
    - in the modern era -- especially that of the post-war era, how
      did dominance over regional political interests lead to the need
      to control the political thinking (and implementation) of entire
      regions?
    - can communism or extreme socialism ever be expected to succeed
      in isolation? iran in the post-war era is perhaps a counterpoint
      to the soviet union's extreme dominance over politics for
      self-perservation.
      - to the latter, was their need for regional dominance moreso a
        practical necessity of ideology or an extrapolation of
        Russia's need for influence over Eastern Europe and the Altaic
        regions for geopolitical (reassurance) and security? whereof,
        this need has been a common theme and motivating factor
        driving Russian policy since the 17th century.

- (back to mandala theory), consider the evolutionary trajectories
  along this ontological space connecting forms of government
  - combined with the specific influneces that neighboring &
    hierarchical groups exert

### Capitalism? Democracy?


### Deconstruct Communism in these terms

- according to this s/phys theory of governance, demonstrate that
  communism, as defined/constructed by marxist thought-leaders, is the
  zenith of totalitarianism, as is any system which methodically
  dominates all resources of the three types, according to its
  ideological principles.
  - socialism/communism start as systems that focus on social-type
    resources, often because of the (exploitation and obselescence of
    the poor) by that society's elite, who dominate financial-type
    resources.
  - communists, especially those employing lenins ideas of pragma
    (etc..), start with what is available: the social resources of the
    proletariate; resources that are all-but-useless to the
    bougeuosie.
    - they start with social-type resources, until they gain power
      (through ideological mindshare and by establishing their
      movement throughout a nation slowly, but steadily forward.
    - after gaining and holding social-type resources, they can turn
      towards financial-type resources, as long as the distribution of
      these financially affluent newfound roles in the social
      hierarchy don't sow derision among more influential party
      members
      - the accumulation of mindshare is key for balance here, as the
        party members need to think and act as one (otherwise as top
        party members gain power, corruption results, though this is
        inevitable with governmental systems that monopolize social
        resources)
        - (note that such movements begin with slowly/steadily seeding
          information through social networks ... to people considered
          irrelevant, invisible and inconsequential by the powers that
          be)

    - after the attainment of sociohierarchical territory necessary to
      influence sufficient financial resources, the party can gain
      near-total dominance over the social distribution &
      accessibility of information-type resources
      - e.g. by upscale its expenditures on media/messaging/etc
      - by depriving party opposition of income
      - this describes cultural revolution, engineering changes to
        language (including orthography) and cultural artifacts


  - lenin's development of pragma, both as an idea and as policy
    implementaitons, strongly rooted itself into the bolshevik
    movement.
    - this shifts tension from potentially revolution-ending, early
      violent conflict to slow and steady social conflict
    - this is very similar to much of the dark social violence i've
      seen in america over the past decade.
      - exploitation of social games to perturb regions of social
        hierarchy
      - the use of language in an attempt to control thought.

- like a bee, leninists can only sting you once and they know it. so
  they run full-scale theatrics and
  - they need to keep their party members engaged because, as with
    religions, if your followers have some kind of ""feeling like
    there's a purpose to the time they contribute.

### The Invisible Hand as Distributed Machine Learning for the Marketplace

- in capitalism which hasn't lost itself in corporatism or oligarchy,
  the invisible hand acts similarly to collective machine learning
  processes in socially distributed computation which optimizes
  economic parameters in the economy.

#### The vitality of (accurate & unskewed) economic signals in microeconomic decisions

- once communists implement a command economy, they make macro/micro
  economic decisions based on the information at hand, while
  orchestrating the implementation. this results in distorted pricing
  decisions and supply-chain sourcing decisions. in an economy with
  low savings rates, people and social institutions exhibit vastly
  different behavior as customers. this distorts informational signals
  that central planners use to make policy decisions and adjust
  implementation details. this is a feedback loop which produces
  waste, inefficiency, poor resource allocation, missed opportunities,
  and unrealized innovation.
