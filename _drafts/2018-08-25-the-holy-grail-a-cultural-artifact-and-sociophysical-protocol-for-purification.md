“...I prefer the term ‘the unconscious’, knowing that I might equally
well speak of God’ or ‘daimon’ if I wished to express myself in mythic
language. When I do use such mythic language, I am aware that ‘mana’,
‘daimon’, and ‘God’ are synonyms for the unconscious, that is to say,
we know just as much or just as little about them as about the
latter. People only believe they know much more about them and for
certain purposes that belief is far more useful and effective than a
scientific concept.” - ‘Late Thoughts’, the final chapter of ‘Dreams,
Memories, Reflections’

# What Do You Do When No One's Watching

> "what you do when no one's watching says more about your character
> than what you do when you think someone's watching."

Not a bad way to reassess your character and the influence that others
have on you, but is it a good way to judge someone else?  Today, in
the 21st century, does this still apply -- when we all know that the
NSA is always watching? Is this really a good way to judge everyone?
How can you be sure that someone has been causally isolated? And if
someone is so socially isolated that it can be said they are
hermetically sealed from causal interference, *ARE YOU AWARE OF THE
DAMNING DOWNSTREAM HARM CREATED IN THEIR LIFE?* Is there any
possibility for true causal isolation in our hyperconnected world?

### Quoth the Raven, "Never more!"

Socially vulnerable people are almost always isolated, in one way or
another, whether sooner or later. Either isolation causes their pain
or pain creates the isolation that births subsequent enmities and
pains, perhaps for the remainder of their life. Extreme or protracted
isolation is a strong mutagen for the psyche. When you know that your
actions causally impact someone's thoughts or state of mind, this in
itself exerts an unconscious impact on your mind.  You are forced to
parameterize your actions by coming to terms with how it impacts
someone else's thoughts, words or actions. For this reason, someone
who suffers protracted isolation will slowly develop neuroses and
gradually lose touch with any social norms. There is no external
reinforcement of norms. Consider how miraculous it was that Chomsky
decoded language without needing to study a Tarzan raised completely
outside the social propagation of language -- could that person ever
learn language? What about an adult who has suffered nearly a decade
of artificial social isolation? What would the effects be on their
person's conceptualization of "adulting" and social norms? It would
nearly ruin their development, perhaps forever. They would never age
normally again, psychologically -- i.e. their process of development
may forever be stagnant and idiosyncratic. They would be misunderstood
for the rest of their life.

In order for isolation to be useful as a psychological change agent,
it would need to be carefully monitored.  Could such isolation be used
beneficially, considering the social or emotional consequences? To
whose benefit? Does isolation work as a vector for psychological
change if the person is aware they're being intentionally isolated? Is
it effective if they have choice? If they do have choice, can they
simply walk away from their isolated circumstances? It's easy to say
they are free to leave unharmed if you live in a society where social
physics is verboten and people are punished for trying to teach
knowledge about life and society. If that's the case, nearly every
person is ignorant of social resources -- and ignorant of how to live
life. What's the point in America trying to pretend that stands to
protect an international order -- the UN and Geneva Convention --
that, in turn, protects life if America also forbids its citizens at
home from learning about how to effectively live life? It's
unbelievable that I would suffer so much lashback from all directions
in America, simply for trying to teach people about social physics! I
want to help people circumvent the pain and torment that I've
experienced at the hands of those who abuse power! GOD FLOOD AND DAMN
IT ALL!

If you believe in the traditional definition of God, then you believe
that someone is always watching you. However, the definition that I've
developed for God is a collection of information from the shadows of
the unconscious which is accumulated through the generations. In other
words, God is a helpful collection of information about causality --
i.e. the downstream consequences of people's actions -- that has been
accumulated over the course of centuries or millenia. This is God, but
does not necessarily imply the existence or non-existence of an entity
who is aware of everything that occurs. Knowing God helps you to
inform your actions with an `a priori` knowledge set of the
consequences of your actions -- without having to live out your
mistakes in order to learn from them. That your conception of God and
your belief systems laws that follow thereof are justified is what
makes the concept of ultimate, unchanging truth so critical in
Abrahamic religions -- how do....

  - Acting in accordance with this definition of God is beneficial and
    acting out of accordance is ultimately detrimental. This
    definition of justice is not carried out by an entity, but carried
    out as part of the socioinformational consequences of your
    actions, both positive and negative. Understanding the
    harmatological consequences of sins is critical to understanding
    right and wrong, given this definition of God.

No, but I was hoping you would make the claim that I was making that
claim because I'm prepared to correct you and siphon your energy to
save humanity.  People lash out at "cult leaders" and since everyone
already treated me like I was practically a *Charles Manson* ... I'm
so tired of being defined by other people as the opposite of
everything that I am. Do you know how traumatic that is? I thought I'd
let people think that I was giving them what they wanted all along:
the opportunity to destroy me. Then, when they went for it, I thought
I'd ask some really good questions. But most critically, I would take
the opportunity to define myself. I model much of my behavior on
Socrates and Jesus. You are the sum of the five people you spend the
most time with: these are the psychological types and metatypes that
you absorb into your mind; the more time, the more psychosocial
osmosis occurs. When have a constant fascination with biographics and
history -- what made the greats *truly great*? -- but you are
thoroughly isolated, then you begin absorbing the personality traits
of history's hero's and villains. This is my working theory, anyways.
It may be wrong, but it's how I rationalize purpose from my suffering
and isolation.

Try it sometime, it's fun. Sometimes it manifests greatness. Sometimes
that greatness is locked away from society, but that's something you
can only help when you have power. If you have none -- no social or
financial resources -- then it's not your fault. It can't be. You
didn't have options. You didn't have power. What did you do to
overcome that? What did the greats do? Learn from them because
informational resources are all you have for power. Are pleasure and
pain the same thing for you? Then you can break free from the
[Lustprinzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_principle_(psychology))
that binds other men, so easily rendering them predictable. You defy
predictability because other men cannot rationalize your conception of
pleasure and pain, of love and fear, .

> That person who is the same in pain and pleasure, whom these cannot
> disturb, alone is able, O great amongst men [Arjuna], to attain to
> immortality. (2.15)

If you define yourself and are not affected by the actions of others
on the shared sociophysical fields, except when it suits your values
system, then perhaps you may be predicted, but you cannot be moved
unless you move yourself. You are like a giant boulder and perhaps God
himself can move it, but no men may exert such force on you. This can
be a quality with both good and bad consequences to the individual --
you must know yourself *truly and deeply* and you must align yourself
to proper values, which render your actions righteous. Even if you do,
and especially if you are vocal in your defiance, men will seek to
test you -- they will subject you to whatever forces they believe
necessary to roll your boulder into lower places and lower realms,
from where they might tower over you and make you their puppet. Know
yourself *truly and deeply*, seek justice, seek truth and seek values
which are universal. Then you are so strong that only God can move
you. This is not simply a metaphysical truth: God is an informational
force acting on reality and can wash you away in an instant.

> Notions of heat and cold, of pain and pleasure, are born, O son of
> Kunti, only of the contact of the senses with their objects. They
> have a beginning and an end. They are impermanent in their
> nature. Bear them patiently, O descendant of Bharata. (Bhagavad Gita
> 2.14)

As I know them sociophysically, heat is broad social motion and cold
is stagnating isolation. Those who try to contain you will freeze you
away from society. Get salty -- embrace knowledge and immerse yourself
in it. When you are deprived of financial resources, you will find
yourself socially bound. When you are socially bound, you will find
yourself deprived of opportunities. Thank God for the internet,
because for now, they can't take that from you. This leaves you with
informational resources. Consume as much as possible, bind your time
and creatively search for your soul, so your isolation does not feed
Jungian regression.

If you're isolated unjustly, it could be because you don't know
yourself -- if that's the case, then mild social isolation can help
you do some *soul searching*. But society at large unjustly mislabels
you and walls you within false distortions of your true character, you
will find yourself at in a confusing hall of mirrors, constantly at
war with images of yourself which are false and distorted. Break every
mirror and define yourself to the world.

Can the sources of enmity within someone and all the echoes thereof
ever be totally cleansed? Where does it all go when we bottle it up?
Can the reverberations of negative energy be neutralized?

These are


Still, several factors are required to justify and pave the way for a
new religion or a new denomination:

### There must be a need.

God is or was dead. We are approaching a cliff and beyond is the abyss
of nihilism.

...

Humanity's need for religion itself is ripe to be rekindled. When it
is, we will have a fresh direction to rush towards and this may be the
final direction we choose to socioculturally evolve towards.
Humanity's collective separation from religion, viz. a shared uniform
belief system, is similar in nature to the energy potential before a
lightning strike. The strength of differential in charge distribution
that accumulutes before hand translates into the approximate magnitude
of the lightning strike. The stronger the dissonance in charge, the
greater the strike. This is why humanity's relegation of religion and
the spiritual -- i.e. Nietzsche's "God is Dead" -- translates into the
greatest such energy potential in history. This energy, when it
becomes socioinformationally kinetic, must be channeled wisely, but it
should not be channeled into a single religion. This is the same Boom
and Bust cycle that's responsible for the spiritual revitalization of
religions and belief systems.

### There must be theological and philosophical distinctions.

- You can't simply copy a movement, belief system or religion. Many
  religions simply take a step.

### There must be truth and it must be defined.

- many people find religion or find God because they need direction in
  their life. Not all religions are the same and not all openly define
  "truth" -- some religions do not have widely published texts and
  nearly all religions restrict the diffusion of esoteric knowledge.
  - i.e. Scientology, Wicca


There must be cohesion and coherence somewhere in the informational
structure of the belief system. The traditions of Scientology,
witchcraft and other are more chaotic and fluid. They try to confuse
their followers and they defy apprehension or succinct description.
Sometimes, there is no definitive text which describes their beliefs

### There must be a mission for the followers.

To save humanity. What else is new?

If you can't do these things, or at least gather followers, then




### Is God Really Dead?

The true 21st century meaning of Nietzsche's "God is Dead" is that
Jüng's idea of the "Old, Dead God" becomes evoked universally in
mankind's imminent return to the spiritual to transcend soulless
nihilism with a sudden revival of religion. instead, it's everyman's
idea of God that returns from the brink of death. whereby Jüng's
concept of the Old God becomes magnified in proportion to the
magnitude by which the archetype of God congeals from unconscious
shadow to prevalent, unifying force of unconscious made dominant in
the collective consciousness...

#### &#x2605; What does it mean for God to exist, but only beyond this world, beyond the veil?

What does it mean *to know* that God can never be totally made
manifest in the physical realm, except by the indirect mediation of
forms from the noumenological realm?


  - "a priori, synthetic" from the metaphysical
- Does this place responsibility on man in manifesting harmony with
  God's true forms as best it possibly can?

![Earthquake]()

The theologically necessary underpinnings of religions have perhaps
changed.

Jesus is an absolute pinnacle of human-being: no man can transcend
what he accomplished. This is what allows the idea of Jesus to form
the basis of the Christian values system: in gradient descent terms,
Jesus is the North Star whose position never changes and if you move
in this direction, you improve yourself.

since humanity is now racing off a cliff into a nihilistic abyss where
all humans are certainly overshadowed by AI, wouldn’t it be great if
there was someone that we could all strive to be, but still surpass in
many ways?

#### Curve-shifting levels of intelligence

  - intelligence (IQ) with the capacity to make large-scale changes in
    a society/population's IQ curve
  - Leonardo da Vinci is an example of curve-shifting intelligence
  - connect to the idea of Prophet-level IQ (though the main
    distintuishing factor here is the source that provides a person
    with "prophet-level IQ" with their intelligence: does it stem from
    an intimiate awareness of God (emanations from the metaphysical
    and collective unconscious)

- harmonizing state of mutual knowledge about the collective
  unconscious (esp. the most strongly emanated aspects) describes what
  happens in the early states of the development of a religion (or
  belief system with a similarly profound capacity to frame/underpin
  worldview for an large groups of people)

- belief systems whose distribution in local population leads to phase
  changes of s/phys networks, particularly in terms of how people
  interact and can make assumptions about consensus, common knowledge,
  harmonized epistemes/behavior/systems,
  - once distribution of and/or recurring engagement in the belief
    system reaches ~(0.1%, 1%, 3%, 10%, 50%, 90%) in local population,
    new dynamics emerge (as a result of: computability of social
    phenomena expanding, harmonization)

### To Be Unconscious to Unconsciousness is the Definition of Insanity

It is to be incapable of knowing yourself or knowing your self in
relation to your world. It is to render yourself helpless to the
intentions of others and to the confluence of phenomena to which they
conscious. Who wants to be helpless?
- To be unconscious to the notion of unconsciousness is to be unable
  to valuate that which you are unfamiliar with. Thus, you will be
  unable to determine how you should prioritize your accumulation of
  knowledge to become conscious to that which will benefit you.
- And therefore, you will be helpless in escaping helplessness,
  regardless of the skills you command and the virtues which drive
  you.
- To me, this helplessness to helplessness is the definition of Hell,
  which is engrained upon someone’s psyche in same manner as one
  raises veal. It is the careful providence of the needs of one who is
  to remain dependent, with emphasis on not waking that person in the
  slightest to ideas and phenomena which that person is not already
  aware.
- Done correctly, it completely reversed the appearance of the
  situation from the outside. The veal — the person who has received
  resources and has seems to have benefitted most at the expense of
  someone else — is seen as a lecher and perhaps an abuser.
- However, the opposite is true, for the person who must operate along
  such calculated methods as to never awaken the veal is the one who
  is conscious and intentional to the true abuse all along. They are
  the ones on the outside who sell the situation as having been
  leached and used, when at any time, had they not CONTINUOUSLY been
  ever so careful in the signals they emitted, in understanding how
  those signals would have been interpreted and in preserving
  artificial social isolation, then they would have woken their veal
  and their source of narcissistic supply would have escaped.

### Post-Transformation, religious traditions to disconnect man from God by institutionalizing spirituality

#### Unraveling of Henosis -- direct union with God

- So (after finishing discussion stemming from aphorism), if to be
  unconscious to unconsciousness is the definition of insanity...
  - then why is it, (reword this: through history's tendancy to lose
    details to the sands of time and through the disruptive mechanisms
    of power)...
    - ... that after their theological institutionalization, that
      religious institutions would dare wall off man from:
      - the wisdom of truly aligning with God
      - the knowledge of ... (?)
      - and *especially* from authentic, *visceral* experience of God.

- Theological institutions are initially constructed to
  preserve/augment the dynamics put into motion by spiritual
  transformation of society: the founders of these institutions
  primarily seek to aid and strengthen the effects of God and their
  belief system in bettering the world around them.

- How are men gradually rendered unconscious to God and to the
  authentic (structure/knowledge of) their own belief system?
  - and why?
  - initially this is a consequnce of (theological necessities)
  - the more sinister motivations of this have to do with social power
    dynamics
    - e.g. the intentional gradiation of men by their consciousness to
      various phenomena (TODO: restructure so that an explanation of
      this occurs earlier)

#### (1) the institutionatlization of sociohierarchical strata --

  - viz. roles and positions in (theological institutions)
    - these self-aggrandizing positions of influence are (alluring to
      occupy for those who seek power)
    - of course, a benefit to such structures in theological
      institutions is that men who seek power *are* bound by a moral
      code that they, in the least, cannot *appear* to violate, though
      they may contort the moral system to their own purposes.

#### (2) by facilitation of the gradual identification of the conscious individuals.

- taxonomic speciation of epistemic forms, structured into the
  theological language of the belief system, helps identify phenomena
  that men may be conscious to or be capable of becoming conscious to.

#### (3) transgenerationally, the socially distributed informational

- ... left by the initial two generations after (the initial
  sociologically-significant spiritual transformation) begins to
  rapidly recede.
  - not all of the informational residue disappears completely:
    instead, the theological institutions which were constructed to
    (facilitate) the propagation of the belief system encode/reinforce
    values systems among believers.
    - since religion is, at least in effect, proto-social-engineering,
      evolution of values systems from individuals to communities to
      nations gradually yield changes in behavior, altering the
      frequencies, expectations and perceived expecations of event
      types, (stochastically: link to article on the Sword in the
      Stone).
      - (from cultural practices, changes in beliefs about morals,
        with socially ) alter
      - this results in shifts in behavior around holidays and even
        results in changes to large-scale migrations, which may be
        temporary, permanent or cyclic in nature. the changes in
        population flux from cyclic migrations in belief systems
        (pilgramages to Jerusalem and the Hajj are two examples) can
        even refocus the centers of trade.
      - (the point is:) religion and belief systems have powerful
        effects on sociological dynamics. they are powerful tools for
        social engineering.
    - however, there are two points more critical than the rest for
      impacting how theological authorities may make early changes in
      the evolutionary trajectory of a young religion:
      - after the religion's founder and/or inner circle have died
      - and after the first generation has mostly died out.
    - primarily for the sake of maintaining authentic adherence to the
      intentions of the religion's founder, its raison d'être, its
      objectives to serve the embetterment of common man, the edifaces
      of the religion must remain rigid in order for it to
      propagate.
      - a belief system which changes doesn't without more explanation
        match the will of an eternal God or gods, who existed before
        the Creation and who transcends time and space. If they are
        truly timeless then such entities cannot change. Therefore, if
        they relevate ultimate truth to the religion's founder, it
        necessarily must also remain fixed in place after, until
        perhaps the God-like entities relevate ultimate truth to
        another prophet.
    - Therefore, as the man-made edifaces of a sociophysical machine,
      religious institutions codify doctrine and generally prefer to
      keep it as it is, especially the most core pieces of
      doctrine. The Catholic church's adherence to this is why over
      1,000 years before someone like Martin Luther was capable of
      standing up without being burned at the stake. What resulted
      from the fallout of the Reformation? The Catholic Church lost
      its hold in Germany and Prussia, states became fragmented and
      were decoupled from geographic boundaries. This precipated war
      and eventually the Westphalian paradigm, coupling states to
      geographic boundaries.
      - The only reason the Catholic Church attained and maintained
        theological dominion over Europe was because of it's singular
        structure of authority. Otherwise, events like the Reformation
        and its fallout would have happened earlier, yielding a
        decentralized Europe as a supple three-course meal for the
        next empire to emerge from the Old World's sociophysical
        center: the Middle East.
    - The undertones and implications are clear: there is strong
      purpose behind keeping doctrine and dogma fixed in place. it's
      necessary for the belief system to attain theological coherence;
      it's necessary for the pragmatic attainment of unity and
      projection of God's will into subsequent generations; in a
      turbulent world, it's necessary for the God, Supreme Being or
      Truth of the religion to seem like a concrete, unwavering
      fortress that is dead simple to explain. Mean are only willing
      to die for the whims of an emperor extrapolated for so long
    - Extrapolate these undertones along with their implications: once
      set in motion, the sociophysical machines of institutionalized
      theology will tend remain in motion, not unlike Newton's second
      law regarding mommentum.


#### (4) ???




- place this close to an intro (for this article?)



### What is Consciousness (round one)

consciousness is our mind's awareness of itself. it is "user" to the
operating system of the mind, which is only exposed to the user in a
experiential, non-definite way. because of this, it is hard for the
user to be precise about what it's own experience "is" since a mind
operating as a consciousness can't completely examine the pieces of
information compose itself or its interface to the rest of the mind.

while our experience of consciousness does originate from the
material, the forms that consciousness and our mind bind to are like
archetypes -- or the composition of metatypes of archetypes, more
precisely. furthermore, as Jüng would explain, the patterns of
experience we perceive through consciousness can also be abstracted as
archetypes. in this way, all the stories and memories we share have
common traits and a common framework of symbols/patterns. if you
understand all this, then reincarnations are like the rebirth of
specific sets of metatypes/archetypes of consciousness, which will
react similarly to the metatypes/archetypes of life experience. our
minds map asymptotically to these archetypes, never embodying them
completely, but neither can we separate ourselves from the impact of
that the unconscious (external or internal) has on our forms of
thought, sensory experience and unconscious psycho/social phenomena.

the last bit (unconscious psycho/social phenomena) is what Jüng's work
is all about -- some of us are "more conscious" to various patterns,
while some of us are completely unconscious to them. i would prefer
being as conscious as is possible to these phenomena, since gauging
what individuals are aware of is critical to personal psychological
development and successfully managing your interface to social
groups. this all sounds very complicated, but parenting is an exercise
in becoming aware of the information/patterns that an individual
gradually becomes aware of themselves.




### False Projection of Unconsciousness to Stimuli as a Skill

- and particularly, leveraging tricks of rhetoric at the intersection
  of logical paradoxes and psychology (like some of those I
  experienced in the workplace) to dupe someone falsely projecting the
  lack of a trigger response to a stimulus into repeatedly displaying
  unconscious null-responses
  - what was i being triggered on? information of various kinds that
    should have been impossible to obtain without at least one of the
    following: criminal background, medical records, surveillance
  - but i have been constantly subjected to artificial dialogue meant
    to project mostly false beliefs upon others, one of whom will
    refer to programmed trigger stimili in an attempt to convince
    others in the same social circumstance that something about me is
    or is not true.
    - eventually, i grew tired of psychologically twisted workplace
      bullies being able to leverage my engrained triggers to provoke
      an anxiety response, so i learned how to harden the artificial
      response that projects unconscious non-acknowledgement of
      triggers by default.
      - but occasionally, people were able to break through even this
        by compelling me to project non-acknowledgement when it should
        be logically impossible for me to do so, were i not falsely
        projecting non-acknowledgement most of the time.
      - the problem this, these were always catch-22 false tests that
        i was intended to fail. most of the trigger stimuli i became
        conscious to, i only ever became conscious to after having
        those stimuli asserted against me dozens or hundreds of times.
      - to *most* of those people who are shit-testing me with such
        terribly subjective methodologies as "we're going to see how
        you respond to *this*!!" ... **FUCK YOU** have you ever tried
        talking to someone and having a Goddamn conversation because
        first of all, _you get it wrong every damn time_. whatever
        group(s) of people this emanates from, the intent is to
        construct ad hoc tests that the target will fail, but
        propagate FALSE beliefs in society to cause people around the
        target to generally distance themselves, thus marginalizing
        the target.


# S/Phys Singularities

- Sociophysical Singularities are alchemical perpetual-motion
  machines, whose existance is guaranteed since values of energy in
  social physics are higher-order and thus systems are decoupled from
  strict conservation of energy.
  - **therefore, perpetual-motion machines DO exist in alchemy**,
    though the structure of these is not yet clear to me.

### Reification of Metatypes, Epitypes and Prototype in Metaphysical Singleton Types

- the ontological structure of a typology of sociophysical perpetual
  motion machines remains unclear. Further, as with every ontology
  whose types, metatypes and epitypes are reified into the material
  plane, there accompanies such ontologies taxonomical structures and
  speciations of singleton-type instantiations of those types.
    - What are singletons? They are concepts from type theory,
      category theory and functional programming, which are usually
      collections of type-structure that are one-off and
      single-instance -- hence the name Singleton

- This definition important to emphasize for it's critical to
  understand the nature of metaphysical forms -- singleton types are
  the containers of type, metatype and epitype which are the
  reifications of ontology. This is made more clear through the lens
  of [Tao](http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/lib157.htm) Te
  [Ching](http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html):

> The Way that can be followed is not the eternal Way.
>
> The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
>
> The nameless is the origin of heaven and earth

### (Adam was to name the animals, Noah was the last of men who saved the animals)

The task laid out for Adam by God to name the animals is connected to
the task entrusted with Noah to recognize the animals and to save
them. One need only consider figuratively Adam's animals as aborignal
discovery of metaphysical and unconscious forms, collected into a
loose taxonomy of forms. Trans-linguistic analysis of the Book of
Genesis, Enoch, Exodus and the other most ancient works of Semitic
origin would render clear my imagined, figurative classification
metaphysical forms as animals. Regardless, a purely literary
interpretation of religious text dissecates the fluid of truth from
religious tradition and, along with that fluid, constricts most of the
value.

### The Theme of Waking Up To Unconsciousness In The Garden of Eden

- this story is about the phenomenon of waking up from unconsciousness
  to phenomena previously unacknowledged
- In this context, it can be seen as a story about mankind's
  psychosocial infancy or the psychosocial infancy of each man
  - towards the latter undertones of an individual's (nascent)
    development, the narrative highlights dynamics to play out
    repeatedly with respect to various phenomena, particularly those
    with moral implications.
  - towards the more collective social application of the same
    phenomena, the narrative highlights the evolving nature of
    pre-Hammurabi and preliterary moral systems. expanding in
    generality, the focus is not merely on the unspoken or formal
    norms in early societies, but also on those on the moral
    implications of interactions between collective groups
    themselves. actions have consequences, for groups as well as
    individuals. in nascent civilization, especially when literacy was
    spotty if extant whatsoever, such intertribal or interregional
    interactions were poorly understood. Social persistence of memory
    has always correlated to age -- particularly the number of
    simultanously living generations, which has until modern times has
    sparsely ever been more than 2.5. With more grandparents spending
    more time with younger parents, this dramatically increases an
    individual's average cumulative flux of information exchange
    between their lifelong connections in their social network.
    Therefore, that societies exoliterary persistence of social memory
    increases exponentially -- similar to an inverse of the [Broken
    Window]().
    - Therefore, early on, social memory was rebooted quite often,
      which was a mythological design imperative for our distant
      ancestors: myth demanded teleological information be compacted
      with semiotic simplicity; else, if the symbolism was too
      complicated for a pre-literary world to be expected to carry on.
      - this compaction of mythos to favor the propagation of
        evolutionarily-advantageous teleological relationships between
        cultural universals
        - relied on semiotic signifiers mostly pointing
        - frequently experienced meta-narrativestowards
          symbols representing
        - local flora & fauna

### Extrapolating Logical Consequences of Epistemic Structures With Epistemological Virtual Machines

In what order did God create light, heavens, firmament, the seas, the
sky, the plants and the animals? In a purely literarary reading, in
precisely six 24-hour periods, one after another, before taking a 24
hour rest. Nevermind that before God began, there was no light, no
earth, and very *literally* no definiton of day or night. So even
within the confines of a literal reading of the Abrahamic creation
myth, you can emulate questions which inviolate the logic of the
reading.

Above, the term "emulate" is a precise, technical analogy for
theology: a (style of reading) invokes a system of ideas within your
mind, which acts as a theological virtual machine. The (particular
style of reading) -- how you choose to adopt the text of multiple
translations, your choice of acknowledging linguistic evolution, your
definition for "Word of God", your opinion of the authors, and
immaculate preservation of lettering through transcriptions of the
original text -- each of these critical choices for your interpretion
rhetorically extrapolates your interpretation into enabling specific
angles of theological discourse and argument.

Abrahamic traditions multiplied from various progenitors across
generations who -- in response pragmatic Mesopotamean quasi-theism
which existed to establish basis for waves of empire and to the
polytheism of waning New Kingdom Egypt -- saw their belief systems to
be the more perfect monadic instantions of philosophical ideals. The
idea of monotheistic God developed as a response to turbulent
polytheistic mythos whose dubiously engineered narratives existed to
justify and facilitate subjugation experienced by outsiders to the
benefit ruling and priest class, ideas of truth were centered around
narratives while true themselves also laid the groundwork for a belief
system of higher truths.

- from here, segue from:
  - the establishment of philosophic motivations of (the lower classes
  of people) -- some of whom were slaves and others whose lives were
  upended by lawlessness and non-universal moral systems -- whose
  lives were fixed in place by turbulent polythestic belief systems
  shifting at the whims of ruling class, primarily concerned with
  geopolitics, sustainance/magnification of power, response to threats
  and (most critically) perpetually economic self-enrichment.
  - For conceptions of metaphysics whose dependencies and taxonomies
    of metaphysical form arise primarily within the material realm:
    why do such metaphysical conceptions with their
    [dependent origination]() centered on the material appeal to the lower
    classes? Why would it be advantageous to for some progressive
    movements and more radical Marxists to center dialectical

### Jesus, The Stone The Builders Rejected

That Jesus is the stone the builders rejected is an epithet with Old
Testament roots in Psalm 118 and was quoted [Acts 4:11](), [1 Peter
2:7]() and in three Gospels: [Matthew 21:42](), [Mark 12:10]() and
[Luke 20:17]().

- TODO: link biblical chapters

- (certainly pre/post-Socratic motivations,)

Authors of three Gospels -- in all except the more figurative text of
John -- in deference to Jesus, referred to the epithet of *the stone
that the builders rejected*.

### How to Engineer the *TRUE* Narrative of Your Messiah(s)

I believe the narrative of Jesus to be one inspired by post-Socratic
developments in Philosophy and to be one pre-ordained independently
ideated over the course of generations: internally, via
transgenerational circles in the Jewish theocratic establishment; and
externally, from theological thought leaders external to Judaism
entirely -- e.g. from the hermetically sealed communities of Essenes
and/or from eastern Philosophic developments such as Mahayana
Buddhism.

- Why was Jesus the stone that the *builders* rejected? Who were the
  builders? Why the allusion to masonry? Why was this first reference
  to a messianic figure found in Psalms.?

- Albeit a notion of personal conjecture, it seems that Essenes were
  something of a community centered around proto-futurism and
  theological research. What is certain: it was not easy to enter the
  Essene community and become initiated; their mandates on purity and
  sinlessness were (total). What is unclear: did the Essenes choose
  geographic features and locale which limited sociophysical flux? It
  is not rare to center monastaries and spirital communities upon
  natural fortesses, but it seems the Essenes selection of geographic
  locale was to

- Assume a group like the Essenes wanted to establish the next phase
  for Abrahamic religion: how would they go about it; how would they
  avoid scrutiny; how would the "dogfood" specific theologically
  necessary elements of their proto-narrative, like abject and
  complete sinlessness?

### No Mere Stone: The Keystone Connecting Eastern and Western Traditions

  of one without sin must also be true? The answer is that you cannot

  the centerpiece to your narrative.

### Alchemy & Pyramidal Alignment of the Weak-Willed to a Strong Will

- alchemy: pyramidal alignment of the weak-willed to a strong will, as
  it relates to sociophysical singularities, the nature of power and
  the emergence of large concentric stratificiations of hierarchies
  around sole individuals/dynasties
  - e.g. persian dynasty, japanese dynasty, mohammed's dynasty
  - why Jesus differed from other kings (e.g. he was the king of kings
    because he was a king that could never be killed, as the basis for
    a belief system which transcended life/death)
    - this forced the earthly manisfestations of Christian
      institutions to remain moored to ideology and avoided the
      gradual taint of sins necessary for maintaining power.
  - (develop this idea, with focus on sociophysical singularity)
    - it's really willpower accumulated from innumerous individuals
      who choose to align themselves with some belief system or
      crystalize themselves to some clearly understood common purpse,
      which yields the monopolar alignment of will. in this way, each
      emergence of concetric stratification of hierarchical structures
      aligned in unity are like monopolar singularities, which all
      share the same world while competing for
      resources/opportunity/attention
      (i.e. financial/social/informational resources)
      - this kind of order can emerge as a result of alignment to
        ideology; to a belief system based on the narrative of
        someone's life; to some common, utilitarian ends (but this
        last cause is usually very weak and thus transient)
      - regardless of the purpose for crystallization/alignment of
        wills, the nature and dynamics of such sociophysical
        singularities are identical, only differing in quality and
        proportion.

### Sociophysical Singularities and Sociohierchical Crystallization

- Sociophysical singularities are like abberations of alchemy,
  self-sustaining vortices of alchemical charge that feed themselves
  on the social, financial and informational energies of
  others. Growing exponentially larger until the singularity's nearly
  rips a discontinuity into a sociophysical higher-order analogy for
  space and time. The magnification of power causes nearby social
  particles to align with the sociophysical energy landscape, becoming
  crystallized with the source of energy amplification.
  - These phenomena always seem to form structures of (concentric
    stratification) of social heirarchy, where (the disruption thereby
    of lower-strata monopolar alignment implies further (opportunity)
    for disruption) ...
    - ... thus *chaos begets chaos*. this is a paradox of solidified
      regimes whose significance ripples through the global system:
      they are *the* definitive powers, whereas to exist, they must
      hold dominion over those who do not support the regime(s).
      whether merely in practice or even through nominal rebellion,
      there will be nascent, growing and real threats to a dominant
      power. this is a challenge that every maturing empire must
      foresee and that every mature empire must deal with: there are
      those who do not appreciate your order and for every seed of
      discord they sown which blooms today or tomorrow, each is a
      small victory for them and a loss for your hegemony.
      - this holds true regardless of the size of the power structure
        in question -- for empires as well as for interpersonal
        networks of power.

    - there is a optimal number of downstream nodes connected below
      each node, around twelve or so. this is rendered more
      complicated by the different types of relationships we form in
      our life as they relate to power -- e.g. family, work,
      sport. still, it is more clearly seen in the direct associates
      to tyrants and their direct subordinates in authoritarian
      governments.
    - for fair distribution sociophysical resource-types -- and truly,
      for a distribution that is optimal for the progressive
      advancement of individuals in that society itself -- then
      sociophysical singularities are (bad). the magnification of
      power tends to not only corrupt, but also to be inherently
      unstable in most cases. its magnetism binds individuals to power
      for their survival, (only to render itself either some
      structural flaw in the process or competition with external
      power structures whereby some externalities then cause the
      teetering strata of the sociophysical singularity to rip itself
      apart).

### Not Every Sociophysical Singularity Results in Regressive Regimes of Power

- The Sumerians: they rose and they fell. The Akkadians? They toppled,
  they consumed, they rose and they fell. The Babylonians? The course
  was the same as with the Akkadians, but they were to be torn apart,
  first by the chaos of the Sea Peoples, then by the Assyrians and
  Persians.
  - These were each empires whose crystallization of power structures
    was centered around great men, but what is certain of great men,
    if there is anything? Great men are still simply men, who live and
    who die, but what is eternal? The metaphysical. What is ineffable?
    The myriad shadows of the metaphysical: the collective
    unconscious.

- Not every basis for a sociophysical singularity results in an
  unstable or regressive regime. Far more resilient are those regimes
  whose center of power resides in ideas and whose power structure are
  crystallizations around those ideas. Why? Because you can kill a man
  or topple his empire, but you can never kill an idea. Therefore, if
  power structures crystallize themselves around ideas, whose
  noumenological existence has troubled philosophers for millennia --
  that is, if no man can precisely name or definitively structure any
  idea -- then how can adversaries so easily destructure a regime
  built upon them?



# If God is Metaphysical/Unconscious...

### How Can God Mediate Action Into the Material World?

- when societies flaunt aspects of the collective unconscious, which
  should be acknowledged as socially resonant/harmonious, then the
  longer this is permitted to continue, the more out-of-balance that a
  sociophysical system becomes.
  - such out of balance systems will eventually correct themselves
    with the application of natural justice (in the sense of what i
    wrote about in my article on natural justice)
    - that is, wrong-doing or amoral behavior cannot so easily sustain
      itself to perpetuate an out-of-balance system

### how to more precisely define balance in terms of sociophysical equilibria?

- it is not correct to say that any and every system must bring itself
  back into balance in such a way, since sociophysical systems only
  exhibit equilibria-like dynamics, but do not have any singular
  notion of equilibria, nor do they maintain perfect equilibria.

### how do these notions of various equilibria types relate to eastern concepts of karma and causal balance?

### Does our true understanding of our relationship to this entity change from epoch to epoch?

- more terse/precise theological language for the above
-

###

### More important than the quesiton of whether God create a rock that he cannot lift is:

- can God create a world where individuals with/out free will who must
  understand the basis & specifics of their obligation to follow an
  omnipotent God by being able to answer that unanswerable question?
    - that is, individuals without free will, if they cannot answer
      the question "can god create a rock that he cannot lift" could
      they truly be said to be in line with the Diety who must be able
      to answer that question?
      - further, if instead we consider God's omniscience, can God ask
        himself a question that he cannot answer? specifically, can
        God provide an answer to a question, which metaphysically, has
        no answer?
      - yet, if God cannot because there is no answer, then how can
        individuals with/out free will be expected to obey God, who is
        not so omnipotent as to be able to defy particular
        metaphysical constrants.

### Disconnect b/w eastern/western ideals

- there's a disconnect that individuals whose western ideals can't
  bridge. (this notion of 'western ideals' needs to be far more
  precise)
  - the eastern evolution of ideas represents the progression beyond
    common materialistic traps (of...)
    - whereas western thought, though not simply a regression
      backwards, carved out from the remaining space a recession into
      the components of ideologies built upon materialism, which as a
      consequence allow those belief systems to
      (distinguish/highlight) the individual. It is not unlike PepsiCo
      carving out the remaining marketshare from CocaCola -- there's
      always an opportunity for a brand to market themselves as the
      alternative, though businesses who pursue this tactic will
      always define their identity in terms of their stronger
      competition. Similarly, eastern thought, philosophy and religion
      clearly advanced far beyond that of its western
      counterparts. For Western powers, enabling the common person's
      believe systems to begin ingesting similar components as the
      "progressions" of the East would assuming the fawning fate of
      eternal deference to the East.  Sociophysically, global
      population dynamics, its flux and the commerce thereof made true
      novelty of thought nearly impossible for Western thinkers. The
      inroads paved by Alexander the Great's conquest reaching to
      establish the Greek colonies in Bactria, would form the basis of
      their connection to the revolutions of Buddhist and Eastern
      thought.
      - Alexander's conquests, extravagantly funded by the Greek's
        waning dominance over the ancient Mediterranean to include the
        same commercial success of Pericles' olivary fortune, was
        motivated by an unquenchable thirst for social actualization
        of the mind -- to spread the Greak ideas for centuries
        distilled like fine wine from specialized colonies of
        philosopher-yeast on its archipelago. Greece was partly
        insulated from the horrors of war by its geography, making its
        islands the perfect petri dishes for the evolution of ideas,
        not unlike the advantages conferred to genetic recombination
        augmented by diploidic chromosome pairs towards the the
        phenomenon of speciation.
      - Alexander the Great, from childhood, was tutored by
        philosophers who would kindle this love for wisdom until its
        light would flow over, pushing this leader to so unwisely use
        Greek's accumulated wealth on the insane idea to conquer the
        world, of which the immediate and first-order effects were
        ludicrous and could never be justified without taking into
        account Alexander's mission to deliver Grecan light to the
        rest of the world, sewing Grecan fingerprints into every
        system of thought which would later emerge from the soils of
        Alexander's brief empire. Alexander did not want to conquer
        soil, he wanted to conquer minds which did not even exist yet.
        - However, it was Bactria and the easternmost regions of
          Alexandria's cultural legacy where Greek philosophy could
          not have avoided its a significant influx of Eastern
          thought, and occured 300 years after the life of the Buddha.
        - After all, the Greeks were not just searching for the
          Eastern Ocean or spreading the seeds of their culture, but
          also interested in consuming as much knowledge about the
          ancient world of that time to inform subsequent calculations
          for aeons-worth of culturally strategic action.
          - In the Old World, the West was *always* at a disadvantage
            to the East, sociophysically.

  - (because of the materialistic influence on western thought),
    individuals raised solely in its cultural confines can't recognize
    this divide, partly (because of homogenously western values
    systems) but also because how they've been led to recognize me is
    as the opposite of everything that i've wanted to be.
  - to them, almost everyone they have known could be affected by the
    allure of positive reinforcement, especially with material
    incentives, or through shame-based negative reinforcement of a
    shared values system with common western heritage.
    - by structuring situations and anticipating the individual's
      response within these terms, then, in the western experience,
      - every individual would be spurred towards action, lead towards
        their definitions of temptation (to create a record of sin,
        which is useful for control) or could be coaxed into
        meaningful long-term change.
    - but what if there is an individual who this society is utterly
      blind to -- they can not whatsoever be brought to see this
      person for who he is ... or at least, the individual the
      inspiration of buddhism led him to want to be, which is still
      who he believes he can be.
    - because society was so blinded, both to his true substance and
      his intentions -- what if nothing that individuals in that
      society would ever compel this person to change as intended?
      like a doctor unknowingly treating patient diagnosed via false
      positive by utilizing methods that grow increasingly extreme,
      there is nothing the doctor can ever do to cure that patient,
      because the symptoms and pathology simply do not exist.
    - what is a primary difference between the values systems in
      modern western society and that of my own? In America, a
      perpetual cycle seems to have emerged, where the naive and young
      are taught to dupe and deceive those around you into commiting
      sins by those who are try to escape their own damnation through
      the temptation of others. if nothing else, then appealing to the
      materialist aspects of a western individual usually allows you
      to sway them, if not to your side, then at least to overlook the
      second and third order consequences of their material gain: the
      third-world factory worker making pennies, the person who bought
      the oxycontin that yielded you 5% profit who will eventually
      destroy every relationship they have touched, the animals
      churned into pink goo in factory farms, or the poor on another
      continent who we'll never have to meet. It's just too simple to
      never think of the people displaced by our success, by our
      power-plays we justified with our survival or by those desires
      which, convenient to all, seem so necessary.
    - it's too simple for all Americans and Westerners to believe that
      our wealth is representative of everything, or to simply not
      care.
      - it all feels so much better that way, doesn't it? could you
        imagine if society wanted to you suddenly *care* about this
        cause or that? gradually, ingredients among your neatly
        wrapped chosen life necessities (... desire for convenience
        and for ignorance of true cost)
        - (it's all too easy to see) the price tag as the only cost of
          commodities or products on store shelves. Instead, each
          ingrediate or component itself forms part of a story where
          the aggregate price of each represent (in significance...)
          merely the dotted i's and crossed t's of some MBA's business
          model. for components and commodities in the lower tiers of
          supply chains, their true costs are difficult to cost and
          price, which the MBA knows well. how do you price the first
          and second order impacts of policies to strictly control
          Corundum supply and production? it's a mineral required for
          all smart phones, yet most of us remain blissfully unaware
          of the tragedies of its production in the early 2000's.
        - to the less-socially-conscious MBA, that's somewhat simple:
          whoever controls supply and production decide what it is
          worth to them. to westerners, if dictators commit atrocities
          in the name of controlling corundum, it is causally
          attributed to them; to westerners, it is their problem and
          their sin.
    - there are people who have attempted to deceive, control, destroy
      or generally disempower me by tempting me or baiting me into
      acting such that it gives them the information they can diffuse
      into society to change how people think about me. i have avoided
      so many traps, but it belies how terribly wrong people are when
      they try to assess me. or at least, that's what i thought for so
      long, but i've realized: they don't care whether they are wrong
      or right about my beliefs, ethics, virtues or aspirations; they
      just want me to be chained down by fabricating causally
      obfuscated information, which distorts how others perceive me,
      fueling the self-perpetuating sociophysical prison which
      contains me or, worse, could render me a puppet. however, the
      bars of this prison are entirely composed of the beliefs of
      others information, which is outside my control. How am I
      permitted social self-determination, when such a cell composed
      only of cumulative misattributed sinful nature which resides
      within the beliefs of others, forever distorted by my very own
      Azkaban dementors. Is a person's soul self-determined or can it
      be externally determined by society? Surely it must be a
      combination, but what happens when those dementors finish
      sucking out your soul? Do you actually become that malevolent
      image that their virulent haunting has replicated throughout
      society? And what of your causal control over what people
      believe, when mathematically, you are connected to the outside
      through a handful of 1&deg; social connections? Suggestion,
      Mandela Effect and viral false belief (manifested) the bars on
      this informational statis-cell, asphyxiated social and finacial
      poverty ... what was there you could ever do to change the
      course of events? Were you supposed to give your soul over to
      your tormentors? A soul is only something you can give, it is
      never something one can take. Yet, were you to *give* them what
      was left of your soul, what would they have you do then? Now
      that the last supporting remnants of your soul have collapsed,
      leaving only the distorted, amplified image that occult forces
      propagated through society, would you ever give in? ... Hell no,
      such suffering only ossified resilience and catalyzed my desire
      to resist becoming the opposite of my values and virtues.

    - What western people don't understand is that, when they goad me
      or tempt me with violating their moral system -- which would be
      "sinning" for Christians, but these people are almost never
      Christian -- they tell me that they intend to create what they
      believe to be wrong in the world, so that they can alchemically
      use it for power, perhaps by "eating" its energy.
      - In contrast, I believe that intending to create harm, sin or
        malicious intent is itself a sin, even though that intent
        which emerges from the heart is invisible and intangible.
      - In some moral system, if actions of some type are wrong, then
        it must be wrong to merely want to manifest these types of
        actions, in yourself or others.
      - That is what western people do not understand about the way I
        think. Though I'm hardly a radiant example of moral purity, I
        will do anything I can to avoid violating this. With a deft
        mind tempered by a variety of experience, it should always be
        possible, though perhaps not easy. If for some reason it was
        not, then I would seek to avoid the greater harm to the
        greater number of people.
    - While empowering themselves through knowledge, if individuals
      choose to purge their heart of the intent to violate the golden
      rule as it applies to others and further purge the intent to
      create intent among themselves and others, then most of the
      problems in the world become unbound from dependent origination
      and will thus never have existed.

# Of Demigods and Henosis

- [Henosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henosis) - being in union
  with the one/monad
  - living in the midst of ignorance, how do we know what direction is
    "up"? why is it that some of us decide to so singlemindedly move
    upward and how has that changed across centuries? is it something
    that is innate to us or does our propensity to move upwards arise
    mostly from our exposure to information?
    - what thoughts could catalyze such a need to pursue higher and
      better aims? thoughts that are, specifically, possible in the
      minds of any men, regardless of the age or civilization they
      live in?
      - "upward motion" liberation of mind/spirit, specifically
        through the initial catalyzing pursuit of knowledge for itself
        - trying to find the most liberating, most empowering
          knowledge
    - in terms of buddhism? what sparks the pursuit of bodhicitta (not
      nominally)
    - seeking the grail as seeking henosis (and/or theoria)

### Why was Jesus the zenith of henosis for the Abrahamic God?

- according to Jewish thought on how authority derived from purity and
  (complete separateness) from Sin, how did this gave Jesus dominion
  over Jewish social institutions?

- (this connects the section on "predicting the future" to the
  following apologetic argument for the elites keeping the masses
  ignorants)
  - apologetics for the elite lol
- until the recent past (and still today), knowing the future changed
  the future. when people remained commonly ignorant of the specific
  social/economic/geopolitical dynamics they would encounter, (they
  couldn't know to react to what they didn't know.) by ensuring that
  people were generally ignorant of their society's "unknown
  unknowns", the authorities in any system indirectly reinforced the
  stability of their own intended future.
  - socially distributing the truth about the future didn't
    necessarily secure the elite's pre-ordained designs for the
    future, but instead expanded the potential for the future by the
    degree to which its (exigent) realities had become understood by
    the average person.
  - generally, the challenges we will face in the near-future can not
    be changed, regardless of (how educated or ignorant of the nature
    of those challenges) the average person becomes. (rewrite)
    - only the specifics of our approach towards this singular
      destination can change.
   - sooo... what's the answer? (spreading information about the
     challenges we will face only affects the specifics of our
     approach towards the same outcome, not the outcome itself)
     - whereas, in the past, if people had woken up to everything
       about the present that ordained their near-future, that future
       would have changed in a very big way.

- TODO: move notes on meta/cognition and volume of graph cliques from
  draft on geometry/mechanics of information?
- predicting the future for self/community/society/mankind by being in
  tune with how socially distributed consciousness bridges to God via
  un/conscious connections that are funneled/shaped by the
  labyrinthian map of the unconscious (viz. the "over-mind" or
  collective unconsciousness) (connect this to Henosis)

  - (in other words), given sufficent intelligence, even absent key
    information, one can extrapolate into the future of variously
    constructed groups by imagining how that labyrinthian map of the
    "global unconsciousness" funnels individual/social investment of
    sociophysical resources
    - elaborate on the specific structure of this "map"
      - particularly its structural components that inherit elements
        of culture, the linguistic intersections between languages,
        social implications of economics (e.g. how the ever-present
        divide b/w the rich and the poor leads to important motifs of
        belief/information systems in society)
    - to those with less "sight" in that regard, these information
      systems are perceived as divergent and intractibly complex. but,
      with sufficient meta/cognition, these information systems
      instead become unbelievably convergent, especially once the
      notion of individuated "self" is abstracted away from the
      individuals that form these groups. the notion of who,
      specifically, dissolves away from the actions of groups
      (... because? of how primarily informational forces shape the
      collective actions of self/community/society and mankind)
  - of course, achieving the necessary (granularity) of sight that's
    required for such extrapolation is facilitated by:
    - social connection -- the composition of the individual's
      connected social groups
    - and knowledge, which provides more robust methods of distilling
      information (by which people can methodically
      demostrate/generate confidence in their conclusions)

  - (of course,) one particular issue with this understanding: it is
    inevitable for exponentially many individuals in society to begin
    developing this kind of sight.
    - of them, those who surpass a threshold of clarity into the
      nature of the collective unconscious along with the
      metacognition to leverage that sight methodologically, this
      phenomenon of ("converging" intelligence) will begin to manifest
      macroscopic dynamics at the social level, whereby it becomes
      impossible for leaders of thought to see any other vision.
      - as described above, this phenomenon (of the viral of the
        methods for this sight) is already intolerably disruptive to
        the powers to be.
      - but perhaps more dangerous is that these people will all begin
        to lead humanity towards the same imperfect vision
        - (which (shares confluence) with the trend whereby the
          possibility for subjectivity begins to evaporate)
        - these all accelerate humanity towards vision or destination
          which is singular but also shared ...
        - but since that vision could be flawed -- or must be flawed,
          since it is impossible to achieve perfect vision -- that
          poverty of subjectivity will (cause us to lose) the
          flexibility required to change belief systems or change
          course.
        - (like those people who encode their math/physics in terms of
          the standard model and those who just make shit up)
    - ![pic of the ghost from No Longer Human]()

  - as an example of this kind of sight and of why statistical
    paradoxes are critical to the vision it provides
    - as complicated as modern telecommunications are, it is
      *unbelievable* that there hasn't yet been a single point of
      failure undermining communications networking technology from
      early phone systems through the modern internet.
    - that the protocols and RFC standards -- with their paradoxically
      overlapping concentricity and inter-stratification -- haven't
      yet allowed a single point of failure provokes the observation
      of a pair of statistical paradoxes:

      - 1. that an event-type whose cumulative probability (CDF)
        seemingly have a value for frequency that is several orders of
        magnitude, but has never been observed, at least not with the
        magnitude that such an event would have on the system.
        - in probability and network-theory, this is what is known as
          a long-tail event and the same power-laws that emerge from
          network theory generate the distributions that describe
          their frequency.
          - the nature of such long-tail events, coupled with
            financial engineering methods built from ito-calculus --
            and thus cannot perceive long-tail events very clearly --
            describes perfectly why the 2008 financial crisis was
            missed by so many.
      - 2. paradox, the second: that systems exist with such long-tail
        event **types** whose frequency is so intolerable to the
        frameworks for incentivization of actors within such system
        could have their probabilities maximal orders of infinitissal
        as to never be allowed to happen. Of the long-tail event-type
        whose probability is [almost certain] and whose consequences
        so intolerable for the actors within the network -- those
        actors paradoxically manage to collaborate against their
        incentivization framework and thus can manage to defeat any
        influence causing the event type to precipitate along with its
        apocalyptic cascade of undesirable events.
        - the probability of this event-type is now paradoxically
          almost never because of the *agency* of actors in the
          network, combined with their incentivization.

    - the first paradox indicates there is a system whose existence
      cannot be guaranteed. it is almost certain that it will be
      destroyed. this is the easy paradox to comprehend.
      - the second paradox indicates that these systems, when valuable
        enough to all parties cannot be destroyed because the most
        influential parties work tirelessly to investigate and defeat
        any signs of the first paradox and thus protect their own
        long-term interests.
      - this is the difficult paradox to apprehend. when you realize
        the first, but not the second, you infuriate the parties
        mentioned in the second while only serving their interests, if
        they happened to miss an indication of system collapse.
        - however, for such a system, if power manages to become
          distributed in such a way that it it causes incentivization
          frameworks to become destabalizing, the system is then no
          longer anti-fragile. it does not respond to its own threats
          because the people within the system *do not act as one*.

    - between these two paradoxes one may witness the incidental
      phenomenon of distributed computation in society. for humanity,
      this is the collective computation power, prioritized by
      self-serving and collective economic interests.
      - each agent attaches itself to networks and when any such
        agents become aware of their need to seek information of an
        indescriptively qualitative value and of their need to learn
        to gravitate towards the gradient of sources of that
        information, then they become centrally motivating nodes with
        more power than any others in sociophysical analogiess of
        fields, a la physics. this is not dissimilar to the primary
        nodes of cryptocurrency blockchains, though these node
        broadcast and reach consensus for all information they digest.

I cannot understand in totality that of which only its faint
adumbration have I glimpsed. To our deliverence from the necessities
of self-preservation -- particularly regarding someone with a message
to innoculate society from metastatic nihilism -- I hope what is
possible, a la second-order logic, is *almost certain*. Still, even if
*almost certain*, will sufficient transcendance arrive soon enough as
to liberate us from such illustrious chains that implicitly shackle us
with desire masked as apparent necessity?

How would such transcendence be received by humanity? Every society
sweeps under itself its dust and filth under a rug, fixed in place by
some table? And solely upon which, *must* it dine? Must we seek
liberation from necessary by compliance with those who ordained the
precociously final world-order? With what might we struggle? And of
those who saw, from whom did they receive sight? From what source of
radiance reflected throughout did the first among them see what had
not yet been known or seen? Does reception of such illumination thus
change the nature of transcendence from the as yet unconscious? How
could it and if its nature is changed by its societal reception moreso
than in how it is perceived by society, could it ever be considered an
absolute source of elevating transcendance?

Still, if the cognizance of the unseen and unknown, could this
preclude man's salvation from need, hunger, greed, desire, and all the
pre-eminent enmity that pervades our stilted, pre-programmed nascence?
From all this, any semblance of purity withers away quite
quickly. Whether we have free will or merely the illusion of choice,
our own causal fibres are woven into the social fabric of causality by
those with knowledge of the world who seek to raise our mind through
gradients of consciousness to phenomena at their convenience so that
we amount to mere bricks in walls which serve their interests, not
ours. Moreover, we are only granted the capacity for cognizance of
phenomena after society has assessed our potential to adversely affect
their own preexistent designs.

If susceptibility to convenience so often surpasses common intellilect
and thereby nurtures society's inbred, virulent fallibility, then
perhaps humanity would have better luck finding uplifting intelligence
were it borne on Mars, as hidden away from man as society is hidden
from itself. Still, if the herd can only be awoken to malignancies
from those on the outside looking in, then perhaps it shouldn't so
unquestioningly demonize its pariahs. Not all who wander are lost.

## ToC

Winding into the cusp of the age of science, does there exist any such
belief system with the potential to decouple mankind from its fate:
devouring itself via violent, metastatic nihilism? God is dead, but
what *is* God? Was God ever made manifest onto Earth? If God is now
dead, how would God be reborn and what would that mean? Still,
further, what would it mean to have the prescient insight to be
Yeshua, the man who, two thousand years ago, knew all of this
philosophical, theological evolution would transgress until such end?

In the minds of men, metaphysically deceased or not, what does the
possibility of God do for society? If something is so important, then
how is it, one spiritual revolution after another, that the
theological elite find themselves subverted and that the idea of the
supreme entity is so convoluted as to render itself nothing other than
a tool such that the blind may lead the blind? And for what? Towards
whose gain is the sum of ideological sacrifice accumulated?

#### John Dee

> Who does not understand should either learn, or be silent.

For any religious belief system, or any aiming to establish a
universal basis from which one may emulate perspectives and
worldviews, it is critical that all the parts and the whole be
mereologically coherent -- consistent with themselves and all
combinations of components thereof. This mandate of self-consistency
must be attained not simply for the time being, but for all times,
present and future. Permitting some ineffability, God and the belief
system must capture something timeless causing all without root cause
for itself. There is a Greek word that has seemingly escaped the
internet -- which perfectly captures this design imperative for truth
throughout, forever and from all perspectives. The word describes
perfectly the notion that no information should ever arise which
logically, experientially or epistemologically undermines the belief
system, rendering it irreperable or indefensible as it would seem to
the average follower. The belief system must, itself and in its
institutional implementation, be capable of adapting to linguistic
shift and cultural influences. If preservation of the belief system's
perceived consistency outweighs its support of rationalist inquisition
or scientific advancement, that would foment economic stagnation and
it would eventually be superseded.

Unexpectedly, humanity will find it needs religion more than ever, but
when it finally goes looking for this generations emanation of God, it
may be too late. In the 21st century, given the acceleration whereby
information reverberates globally -- particularly more permanently
than ever, each iota of data capable of converging almost totally --
this mandate for timeless self-coherence of any theological system is
almost certainly impossible to attain or preserve. The minutia of the
dynamics of information exchange today *almost certainly* preclude the
establishment of a novel belief system which would unify mankind
against the tyranny of nihilism, especially some system based on the
events in one man's life.

Where, then, does mankind find its salvation from the *metaphysical
precipitation* of its more malignant aspects? Perhaps I am neither the
one to find it nor am I one to relevate it, but who is looking? How
much time do we have?

- define the "Kernel" of God as the (necessary-in-itself) emergence of
  the aspect of the collective unconscious made spectrally harmonious
  by the Golden Rule. (that is...)
  - the total image of God would map to the entirety of the collective
    unconcscious, including within it all things possible,
    conceivable, thought to be possible or inconceivable to consider
    as possible. essentially, [Abraxus]().
    - extend this by clarifying that all religions indoctrine aspects
      of the spectrally harmonious collective unconscious which their
      priest class has become conscious to. "Thou shalt not murder" is
      an example of something perceived as universally true, since it
      is deemed wrong for any individual to murder another. Therefore,
      the collective experience of phenomena such as sin guarantees
      the eventual codification of such into aspects of belief and
      law.
      - (not simply law: also purported destiny, purpose in life,
        prophecy; whatever is believed to be universally relevant or
        culturally...)
        - ![pic of marling]()
        - belief systems also create marling points for grounding
          individuals to frameworks for incentivization that
          themselves become elements of both the collectively
          conscious and unconscious. marling is a type of knot used
          repetitively to fasten a rope to a timber, but in such a way
          that the knots can be adjusted as the load demands. If you
          imagine the rope as the linear flow of time or some other
          concept which is typically unpredictable, then the
          adjustable "marling" events can be shifted around and only
          need to occur in sequence to maintain causal continuity. Of
          course, it's limiting to only imagine the metaphor in purely
          three-dimensional terms, but the point is to aid design for
          some typically unpredictable system whose feedback loops are
          complicated such that phenomena in the system monadically
          *marled* together to drive the system back towards it's
          intended linear progression.
        - these are tools of design for belief systems (or...) that
          alter the "degree of total domain concavity" of probability
          distributions for events along a typological, ontological,
          or taxonomical domain.

![fem ]()

For the above picture, if the domain were typologically organized
events and the color values indicate the range, then the system is
more predictable when the occurance of events is funneled into a
smaller area of domain, limiting the distribution's spread over the
domain. As the less prevalent events are pared away, the frequencies
for any event will predominantly sample as a more prevalent event than
a rare one. Spectrally, a probability distribution becomes much more
predictable, but because of the nature of independent events as
products of probabilities, the predictability of the system as a whole
is moreso magnified.

      - (That such elements of a belief system experience universally
        reach ... is why the Golden Rule correlates/drives their
        resonant spectral harmony amongst all individuals
        collectively)
    - Becoming conscious to the spectrally coherent aspects of the
      collective unconscious, relevant to the welfare of populations
      currently or generations into the future, is necessary for
      (brainstorming)

  - the embodiment of this definition (above, segue), to exist, does
    not need an intellect to be physically manifested to conceive it,
    to be capable of conceiving it, etc... nor does such an embodiment
    ever change, a consequence of its eternally-encompassing nature.
  - define spectrally harmonious (as it relates to the Golden Rule)
    - expand on above...
    - why does this region of the collective un/conscious, which is
      constructively amplified via its spectral harmony:
      - approach (similarly to a limit) some ideal with significance?
      - guaranteed (universally without dependence on time/space) to
        approach a form that is universally identitical (though the
        size of such an image is more expansive than is conceivable by
        the human mind).
    - why these notions imply that man-made revelations of
      such understandings are inherently imperfect
    - contrast/connect this with the theological idea demanding
      immutability

- connect hyperintelligence, incarnations of form and
  archetypes/metatypes of incarnation.
  - the zenith of hyperintelligence is a form capable of emulating all
    other forms.
    - it embodies within itself everything that is possible ... etc
    - it is a form which is necessarily timeless
  - incarnations of knowledge/wisdom/archetypes, then, according
    to their degree of of similarity, all can be measured up against
    this unattainable zenith of hyperintelligence.
    - that beings in the future closer to this pinnacle would manifest
      (is so [almost certain] as to be predestined among those salient
      earthly hosts)
    - among all incarnations manifested on earth may be one
      sufficiently close

  - as such, near-incarnations of this pinnacle-ideal are like
    dynamos/vessels of wisdom/knowledge. the more socially connected
    society is, the more likely that the wisdom/knowledge produced by
    or contained by such beings would (copy) itself and spread to
    beings incapable of reaching those (forms) themselves. There must
    be some critical mass required for (the epi-genesis...) of
    spiritual revelation into its worldly implementation. This
    critical mass could be defined as population density,
    technological knowledge, (some metric of) collectively traumatic
    crisis(, motivating diaspora.) For any such cause, the key is a
    framework of (wise) individuals in place (with the capacity to
    act) to transmute such catalysts into the (implementation of
    cultural technology into infrastructure)
    - to find/identify entities capable of embodying such a zenith or
      even approaching such is complicated if the forms that emerge
      thereof have replicated through society.
      - in other words, if such people are tightly connected with
        others, then it becomes difficult to track down the source of
        the self-replicating forms of information.
      - this is especially true, since the images of information which
        are replicated are merely the lower-order superficial
        extrapolations of the true wisdom or true knowledge. people
        may copy what information or such lower-order informational
        extrapolations that they understand, but they can't so easily
        replicate the higher-order information generating it.
        - "who makes the makers?"

### Phi

- (briefly) phi as the basis for modeling all structures of
  information, even that which has infinite and uncountably complex
  structure. (or move this to the speed of thought: geometric
  mechanics of information)
  - compare to Socratic maxim "I only know that I do not yet know"
  - compare the Zen notion that Tabula Rasa is ("more pure") since it
    has a greater capacity to be shaped as such. for any image of
    information, as it accumulates reified structure, then deviates
    from the graph-theoretical image of phi, which is paradoxically
    most infinite, most irrational and yet most empty. such a
    graph-theoretical notion of phi is best imagined initially by
    starting with the contionuous fraction or continuous root
    definition of phi, extending it by functorially lifting to a
    graph-theoretical or combinatorially category-theoretical image.
  - once a mind within itself contains any structure whatsoever, it is
    almost certainly more difficult to ever re-approach this ideal
    state of phi-ness than would be to leave an empty mind to itself.
    - all this i've said, in spite of the inherent *numerical*
      intractibility of comparing any informational form to the
      all-encompassing empty form -- or even holding within some
      digified form the graph-theoretical schematic zero-form of
      phi. *if no form as a base schema can be held, neither can any
      form can be internalized* -- which to be compared against the
      former, at least without leveraging algebraic tricks similar to
      those used for avoiding the numerical limitations imposed by
      floating point numbers, precludes the ability to compare many or
      multitudes of forms.

#### (Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem)

- metaphysically, the *prima materia* is always structured more
  closely to phi than any such metaphorical *aqua regia*, the catalyst
  for dissolving any impurities from pure gold and for testing its
  authenticity.
  - understanding this begs the question: what is the purpose of
    scouring the occlusions of life to obtain sufficient knowledge of
    wisdom, if one is only to realize that they are further away from
    the structure of the truth as a result? how one maintains such
    purity in others, if the process of molding a mind to nearly any
    form inherently draws it away from perfection: towards which, any
    such direction any mind might be pulled draws away from the ideal;
    towards any such image any mind might be shaped, kinematically
    deforms and displaces further from the ideal.
  - what is the point?

# The Holy Grail

- An object that allows you to drink in the same manner that Christ
  would drink, from literally the same object, healing any disease and
  curing any illness.
  - a la, an object that allows you to "drink" in what Christ once
    drank in, consuming an understanding that could cure all ills.

- as for the search for such an illusive object, which was in essence
  an intangible metaphor and simultaneously artifact whose
  authenticity proved the existence of Jesus and thereby God.
  - This, in itself, if ever uncovered, would preclude Jesus'
    insistence on the necessity of Faith for belief until the second
    coming
  - yet for the mythical Grail and the quest whitherto, it would be
    the act of searching and causal consequences ensuing thereof which
    culturally augmented Europe from the latter Dark Ages until the
    end of the Middle Ages, embuing its peoples with the need to
    develop the tools and connections for the Grail's
    discovery.
    - Paradoxically, if found, the Grail would have precluded the same
      reliance on the pillar of Christianity that Nietzsche would
      later declare as so essential to its existence as to doom the
      belief system, albeit a collapse brought by causes of a
      different nature.

Europe needed cultural transformation towards a culturally unified and
geopolitically stable region, capable as resilient against the
inevitably militarily superior world's center, whose geoeconomic
centrality predestined a robust economic fate.  Towards the end of
tipping Europe's balance of resource allocation eastward, mythical
elements such as the Grail acted as catalysts for such upward
evolution.

Other elements less directly reliant on myth, such as pilgramage and
the need to finance the often military protection thereof, also acted
along similar means as elements for cultural advancement. For example,
the guaranteed increase in sociophysical flux of transient population
traveling to and from the Holy Land not only demanded strengthening
forces for security and stability in the regions closest to it, but
also required the cooperation of Europe's rulers in collaborating to
provide such. This eventually precipitating the Crusades as a response
to incursions against pilgrams. Although the Crusades are an
often-cited indictment against the violence of a specific religion --
or of religion itself by atheists -- they were firstmost a response
against senseless violence, though one which perhaps deviated from the
tenets of the religion. This geocentrically focused increase in
sociophysical flux of both persons and commerce strengthend Europe's
gateways to the outside, allowing it to harden itself geopolitically
against future economic and military threats, who would with utmost
certainty possess the abundance of fruits accumulated from millenia of
economic centrality.

That wasn't Europe's only major cultural attempt to shift power
towards the east. The roads to the Middle East, from both the West and
the Far East where few: the Silk Road, roads through India via Persia,
naval travel from Arabia, through the Caucasus of the European
northeast via the Black Sea, and through the baltic regions across the
Isthmus of Constantinople, to be later declared as Istanbul. Why would
Rome subsume the cost of abandoning its center of Rome against the
onslaught of Vandals and Goths? Since the paths towards the middle
east were few, by shifting political and thereby economic power
centers eastward, the dual capitals of Rome guaranteed its survival
and allowed the early Christian world to project a more lasting
Western cultural influence into the region. Constantinople further
guaranteed the remnants of the Roman empire right of passage for naval
thoroughfare via the Bosporus Strait, connecting it to trade
surrounding the Black Sea.

    quest for absolute truth was borne Science; and for becoming the

    and individual circumstance to become singly focused on absolute
    truth for all, decoupled from inherited traditional vehicles and

In addition to architecture and military power, the Romans were also
notorious for employing heuristics. Though their system of numerals
was trivial and ingenuous, they made decisions with data and they had
the power and logistics to collect it. Roman statistical
extrapolation of census data gave its empire data whose granularity
was unparalleled in the ancient world. This would prove to be
invaluable for estimating population growth and population density of
regions, both of which are vital for economic and military insight,
particularly for allocation of resources, for lensing logistics to
service populations in need and for managing dynamics of inflation for
their fiat currency in the first three centuries A.D. To further such
aims of strategic clarity, with aqueducts, Romans could position
cities and forts in more central, easily defended areas that depended
on roman infrastructure.

- but... could roman census data along with the metrics of measurement
  guaranteed by their advanced system of roads, complete with mileage,
  have enabled the Romans to model population density and fluctuations
  over centuries to the point of extrapolating generations into the
  future? Certainly, but could they have predicted population growth
  to the extent that they could, loosely, estimate the number of
  generations remaining until a European population crisis? *If* any
  analysis could predict such trends, then could the data be loosely
  persisted through myth? Even if the accuracy of such analysis is
  inconceivable, population growth could be, or incidentally would be,
  curbed by major depopulation events like the Black Death which would
  extend the time remaining until such Apocalyptic crisis from
  twenty-six generations through forty generations.

### A quick non-theological apologetic argument

what does it mean for atheism to triumph if all individual belief
systems collectively end up being social white noise

![Graph Theory pic]()

so, consider each of those graphs an individual piece of information,
composed of other pieces of information

and also consider each piece of information a frequency

now consider the social distribution of that information. when there
are more instances of a specific structure of information, that
information is louder -- i.e. it is "turnt up"

so you can socially amplify information, but it is also possible to
attenuate pieces of information

if people decide how to structure their values, morals and according
to their individual belief system (whether that is an individual
atheism or a shared religion) then doesn't religion have value as
effective social engineering?

basically religion is a socially replicating structure of information
(or a memetic program) that inculcates homogenous information
structures into society.  now consider sociological systems in terms
of game theory. what does spatial complexity mean for games? if a
space is more complex, then it requires more computation to solve that
game, if it is solvable at all

when people's actions and beliefs are aligned, then social games are
more predictable. as followers of a religion, they can advance their
own group but also render the social games in society more predictable
by seeing the world in terms of their own religion

it's a framework of thought that simplifies life and helps followers
avoid mistakes. and even if it cannot be connected to some basis in
absolute truth (i.e. God) it still has value in that it's an
information system that creates spectral harmony in society

even if someone follows that argument, they are still left deciding
whether or not one individual conceptualization of God is valid or
corresponds to absolute truth. that's not my problem, although i do
have an argument for that as well.

furthermore, atheism to me is the "nadir" of belief systems.
it's the most minimal belief system.

there really is a void left in life that isn't necessarily filled by
secular institutions or atheists. that is, religious institutions
performed and still performs very critical functions in society. if
religion were to suddenly disappear, these functions/roles/niches are
not immediately available from other social institutions in society

a great example is the role that mandatory church attendance filled in
medieval europe. by forcing people to attend church weekly, this
established a guaranteed weekly social flux of information. the
function that church performed here was similar to the heartbeat
network in VPN hardware or the social "heartbeat" of information being
pushed around the local social environment.

#### [Heartbeat Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_network)

if you were to rip that out of Medieval Europe and not replace it with
anything, europe would have quickly become decentralized and would
have fallen to the Middle East quickly. There was an eternal battle
between Turkey and Eastern Europe, which people most often associate
with Vlad the Impaler. If it were not for some culturally unifying
belief system, Europe would have become subservient to middle eastern
economic interests

as for the whole "heartbeat network" analogy, basically church served
as a weekly sociophysical health-check on the community. to encourage
a rhythmic flux of information.

but this is ONLY possible when you have socially distributed
information which act to establish behavioral protocols for social
interaction (i.e. holidays, traditions, weekly prayer, daily prayer,
etc)  all of these must collectively add value to the
community/society/followers. otherwise, some other religion or belief
system fills that void because it's better adapted to providing value

none of these arguments rely on the 'a priori' assumption that God is
absolute truth.

so you don't acknowledge the impact that belief and information have
on the collective action of individuals in society?

if information doesn't influence the actions of people, then i'm
wrong. i'm not.  so socially distributed information does influence
behavior, and now the question becomes: how does one design
informational systems to optimally benefit either society or your
religion's followers? isn't that social engineering?

- the effect of death on early humans (in the era with early
  architecture and earlier) with poor communicative ability mean that
  the pain of close social loss that accompanied death was something
  that was profoundly more difficult to communicate than it was in any
  era after language became sophisticated.
  - it would be similar to the pain experienced by a dog who loses its
    owner to death and is clearly affected, but cannot convey their
    pain to anyone close by, nor can they come to terms with why the
    event occured. because in this period language constricts the
    consensus of abstractions and information (encodings of reified
    abstractions), people would likely have struggled over loss and
    the effects of violence, until they learned to cope with the pain
    by leveraging architecture to mark and notate sites of
    significance (etching them into social memory) and inventing
    mythological vehicles to help each other move forward (culturally
    and socially) to cope with loss
