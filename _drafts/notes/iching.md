- episodes seem patterned on pairs of iching #Hexagrams
  - Each character represents a #Trigram.
  - The hexagrams for the episode are emphasized by “loud”
    interactions between characters early in the episode or are
    inferred by the themes throughout
  - #Kamina symbolizes “the middle son”, the abyssal
  - #Yoko symbolizes “the receptive”, it seems.

#### Episode 5

- Episode 5 is thus the earth/receptive on top of water/abyssal, hence
  Hexagram 7 (the army)
  - but also possibly #Hexagram8, holding together; both of them, but
    I’m not sure yet)
  - to validate, immediately after falling through the Earth, there is
    a large abyss with iching symbolism -- the first apparent
    homoglyphic references to yin/yang lines -- and they finally fall
    into #Water at the bottom of the long long abyss.
  - In terms of the hexagram #TheArmy, this doesn’t bode well for
    humanity, since water in this hexagram symbolizes a nation’s
    readiness to fight.

### Kiyoh, Kinan, Kiyal

- the loudest symbolism so far:
  - has been the introduction of the three sisters Kiyoh, Kinan,
    Kiyal, who along with a fourth member fight a Revolution against
    the gunmen using Burning Water
  - Burning water seems to represent Hexagram64, Before Completion
     (i.e. fire over water)
     - I.e. in the context of a war against the gunmen, before
       completion seems to mean “before it’s too late” ... why is this
       strong signal?

- This invokes I Ching imagery because it deviates from normal
  dialogue “configuration entropy” (I.e. it feels stilted with a
  purpose) to introduce the sisters as, definitively, the
  OldestDaughter (the gentle; wind), the MiddleDaughter (the clinging;
  fire) and YoungestDaughter (the joyous; lake) — in the INNER WORLD I
  Ching configuration, which adds another layer of complexity ☯️
  further



- Iching-influence is validated for Gurren Lagann. It’s such a strong
  hit at this point that it’s undeniable.
  - What’s unclear is whether the interpretations I have are correct
    - for the character’s #trigrams and/or episodes’ #hexagrams
    - and whether that pattern exists at all

- Whenever I have the suspicion that the iching is an underlying
  design pattern, perfectly fitting the interpretation to that
  prefigured construction so that the pieces all line up is very
  difficult.

## Gurren Lagann Episodes

#### Episode 1: Obstruction (39)

- EpisodeOne seems to feature the themes Hexagram4 YouthfulFolly and
  Hexagram 39 Obstruction, which are the potential pairs formed by
  Kamina and Simon’s trigrams (the abyssal, water; and keeping still,
  mountain) ... ☯️ Simon has “a drill to pierce the heavens” and the
  show seems to be about an inverted, upside down world, where people
  are trapped in a false paradigm of metaphysics (one that’s often
  found in the western world) ☯️ there are “inner worlds” and a
  singular outer world. In the I Ching’s philosophy, forms from the
  exterior metaphysical reality are projected from TheCreative into
  our shared interior reality TheReceptive. ☯️ So the manifestation of
  the gunmen enemies represents this phenomena of metaphysical
  precipitation, but also the show is obviously deep with intriguing
  interpretations and symbols, all valid until demonstrated
  otherwise. If nothing else, all interpretations (exegesis), even if
  invalid, are useful for evaluation and for thought and
  exploration. One should be able to engage in dialectical thinking to
  evaluated meaning and correspondence to etch away the space of
  invalid interpretations to find what is valid — but the process of
  doing so is what gives rise to growth and learning.

#### Episode 2: ???

#### Episode 3: ???

#### Episode 4: ???


#### Episode 5: The Army (7)

- earth over abyss


#### Episode 6: ???

- early in the episode there is mountain over abyss, but the imagery
  of "mountain" is not 100% clear.

- Fog in the mech early in the episode when Yoko flips out bc it
  stinks. A quick search on "Fog" and "I Ching" shows Hexagram 4 and
  Hexagram 59, but these references to fog/mist are are arbitrary -

#### Episode 7:


#### Episode 8: Splitting Apart (23)

- mountain over earth
- at the end of episode 7, a volcano explodes and the characters
  mention mountain and earth. this seems to indicate Hexagram 23:
  Splitting Apart.
  - knowing what happens in this episode, it doesn't seem like Kamina
    heeds the signs of "splitting apart"
- in contraposition, seems to be Hexagram 15 (modesty). i get this
  feeling because of the conversation between Simon & Yoko about the
  lava coming from the center of the earth
- Kamina mentions "can't a man get some rest around here?" or
  something similar. the imagery of a bed progressively breaking to
  pieces is throughout (23) Splitting Apart
  - at the end, Kamina dies, and thus he may represent the inferior
    man? but this interpretation doesn't take into account the roles
    typically attributed to each line (advisor; 5:ruler, 6:sage)

#### Episode 8: The Abyssal (29)

- water above abyss? (i.e. abyss on abyss)
- Simon falls into the abyss. there is rain throughout. a vessel is
  pushed into the abyss, which carries Nia
- after opening the case and finding Nia, the rainclouds part and
  light appears. This may mean that Hexagram 29 (The Abyssal) changes
  into Hexagram 5 (Waiting)
  - very soon after, three unexpected guests arrive: an enemy and two
    friends ... hmmmm but these wouldn't be the lines read for 29 =>
    5, but instead those read for 5 => 29


## Kakegurui xx

#### Episodes 3 and 4

Although these aren't strong connections, there is at least the basis
for assuming story elements (plot and characters) are connected in
some way to Yin/Yang, though not necessarily I Ching.

- 陰喰 三欲 Inbami Miyo
  - 陰 is Yin
- 陽喰 三理 Yōbami Miri
  - 陽 is Yang

- the sister’s last names (Inbami and Yōbami) contain the characters
  for Yin/Yang in the Tai Ji
- the sisters have some basis for a telepathic means of communication
- the game the episode center’s on involves modular arithmatic (in two ways)
  - the cards are numbered 0 through 3. hence modular arithematic
  - players take turns playing randomly assigned cards in their hand
  - the lower the cards in one’s hand, the better.
  - the player forced to play a card over 8 loses. again, modular arithmatic.
- the game/story hinge on having a fair shuffling of cards and whether
  the players are aware of a specific shuffling strategy for cards.
  - the Artesian method's reliance on modular arithmatic, which
    produces a completely uniform distribution, is a critical aspect
    of I Ching that places it above other similar methods of
    bibliomancy. Everything is fairly weighted.





# make this a machine-learning post

- include differences b/w this and [XGBoost] and other boosted
    tree-like algorithms
  - this is not an adversarial network, but instead requires many
    pairs of game-playing algorithms to compete against each other,
    with an algorithm on top controlling hyperparameters of handicaps
    and also trying to use the inverse of random forests to infer the
    valuation of trees which match the impairment of game mechanics in
    players ... i.e. how do the games mechanics functionally
    correspond to the features used by the lower-level algorithms and
    can more advanced representations be developed

#### (from response to Carl Jung's assertions on eastern/western causality)

> "The manner in which I-Ching... ... than a clearly defined result of
> concurring causal chain processes."

- discuss Carl Jung's assertion comparing the distinctions between the
  Western and Eastern perspectives on causality to:

  - (TODO: emphasize that chess is not the proper game to use, since
    it's deterministic, though the specifications for move history
    (does not have perfect information))
  - Two chess masters, with varying awareness of game history, who are
    playing some random game selected from an index of all chess
    games, famous or amateur.
    - The two masters awaken towards some random move in the midgame
      of this chess match. One has memory of the total move history
      and thus, the entire causal chain from beginning to end.
      Initially, the other player only knows the arrangement of pieces
      on the board as they are, but from then onwards accumulates
      memory of move history.
    - The residue of experience left in long-term memory may cloud our
      perspective as much as it sharpens our understanding of the
      present. The same is true for working memory used in chess?
  - Which player is likely to win any given game?
  - Given the players, the games and the board-states were properly
    sampled from the universal codex of chess matches, is the second
    player truly at a disadvantage by lacking access to move history?

  - Which player is likely to improve faster: the player who wins or
    the player handicapped by artificial restrictions?
    - What differences, structural or representational, would emerge
      between two initially identical adversarial AI's that were
      trained on chess games? For more complicated games, including
      adversarial AI playing virtualized Soccer or Starcraft, what
      advantages are conferred by knowledge of game history that would
      alter the gradual adaptation of AI's playing those games?
    - This pattern of game construction where players have arbitrary
      restrictions precluding perfect information, limiting game state
      and game history especially, should compel AI's in adversarials
      scenarios to reinforce alternate pathways for problem
      solving. In this way, such handicapping introduces biases
      skewing how a machine-learning algorithm conducts its
      decision-making.
      - While this skew is *qualitative* as it relates to the
        hyperparameter's specified deformation of the game's
        construction, the skew's quantitative impact manifests what is
        essentially an implicit [Tree
        Method](https://medium.com/syncedreview/tree-boosting-with-xgboost-why-does-xgboost-win-every-machine-learning-competition-ca8034c0b283)
      - Why a tree method? Because for the handicapped algorithm to
        pare evenly against the algorithm with perfect information,
        the former must do so by skewing it's prioritization of
        features.

      - Now imagine a hyper-algorithm that is given the theta-weights
        for many of the aboved trained adversarial pairs: these pairs
        can either have identitical hyperparameters specifying altered
        game construction or such can be variable; initially, results
        may tend to be more consistent with identical hyperparameters.
      - What does this hyper-algorithm do?
        - it coalesces across the many trained adversarial pairs and
          attempts to understand the functional relationship between
          aspects of the game construction and the resulting implicit
          skew on theta-weights.
          - it would do this by using a Tree Method to attempt to
            match the combination/weighting of features that matches
            the dissonance in feature-prioritization found in the
            theta-weights of the impaired algorithm. (since, in order
            to compensate for lack of perfect information, the
            impaired algorithm should leverage its features in
            distinct ways to compensate for the difference, thus this
            dissonance in theta weights could be matched by a Tree
            Method, since it's a *generalized*, **analytic** method)
        - why is this challenging? because if the handicap is too
          severe, impaired adversary is always punished by its
          backpropagation function.
