#### Language/Terminology

the article needs its terminology clarified and it's content condensed

- awareness-entity: i need a term for a instantiation of self-aware
  consciousness from one point to another.
- non-temporality of consciousness:

- neural circuits: this term needs to be clarified, then distinguished
  from "neural pathways"
- **particularly**: i hate repeating this word


Article Structure:
===========

- (is there some kind of better mind-mapping tool for this?!)

#### introduce questions answered by the analytic neurology perspective *BRIEFLY*

1. Philosophical (generally)
  - perhaps split this into (???) and epistemological/metaphysical
1. Psychological
1. Neurological
1. Phenomenological

#### Justify the "new thing i made up"

- the objective is to introduce tough questons in each domain that can
  be more effectively addressed with a Neuroanalytic perspective

  - if this can be accomplished, while sufficiently distinguishing
    "Analytic Neurology" as a set of conceptions/perspectives/patterns
    that are distinct from other formulation, then Analytic Neurology
    has significance.
    - the difficulty in demostrating significance is that, not only is
      "Analytic Neurology" a term I made up, but that the collection
      of concepts/patterns/perspectives it encompasses also intersect
      and overlap with many other forms.
    - however, i posit that "analytic neurology" more effectively and
      comprehensively organizes within it all of those other
      connections, overlapping fields, etc.

## Analytic Neurology 101

(Recently... ), analytic neurology, a conception of the brain and
mind, bridges some very important gaps in the following fields:

### (What questions/problems does this help us reason about?)

- 1️⃣ Philosophy (What distinguishes the mind from the brain? Are
  metaphysical forms universal or materially dependent?

  - If metaphysical forms arise from the physical alone, then all
    similarity amongst metaphysical forms is purely incidental; that
    is to say that relationships and patterns that we identify in
    these forms can't be mapped to some global ontology in the sky,
    which contains all metaphysical structures that were pre-ordained
    before the material universe was created.
    - The truth is that we perceive our own analytic representations
      of form and, not only do these forms all relate to each other
      via some [topological metric]() of similarity, *there is a
      global ontology in the sky* to which all these forms
      map. However, confounding even Kant, we may never know the true
      substance of those noumenological forms emanating from such a
      ontological repository of *all-myriad form*. The [Tao de
      Ching]() names these forms: nameless, the mother of all things.
    - (HERE...) These Analytic representations of form are encoded
      into matter and energy arising from the material of these forms
      can never.

  is any relationship between patterns
  amongst those forms is purely incidental; that is to say, forms
  materiall



- 2️⃣ Psychology: How do Jüng’s archetypes and ontological patterns
  (typologieS, plural) correspond to neurological circuits &
  structures?

  - TODO: move the following
  - Brief overview on how Analytic Neurology accounts for how the
    unconscious bleeds into the material realm, congealing into the
    materially metaphysical. Thereby, the unconscious manifests
    tangibly as phenomena and results in tendency for analytical
    representations to shape themselves. In Hegelian fashion, ever so
    do these facets of the mind as analytical machines shape
    themselves, converging to noumenological forms of the unconscious
    made metaphysical.
  - Every machine is a complex configuration of simple machines. Every
    analytical machine is composed of lower-level structures --
    perhaps there are most fundamental component-types mirroring those
    of simple machines.
    - For analytical machines with potential for dynamic structure,
      since they gradually evolve to mirror or embody abstractions of
      logic, metaphysics and even the unconscious, they replicate and
      convolute forms that approximate the noumenological.
    - This is what precipites Jüngian archetypes and the large-scale
      patterns of developmental dynamics that accompany his
      ideas. Jüng's ideas apply to the development of _all analytical
      machines_
      - (this "brief aside" is factually incorrect as stated)
      - a brief aside on the seemingly intentional "misnomerization"
        of Jung's concepts of typology, which nearly blinds
        psychologic students who may be conned into misidentifying the
        MBTI personality as *the typology*, whereas it is merely the
        reification of *a typological construct*. Whereas ontological
        objects seem to the global patterns within which are placed
        typological constructs for some domain, typologies are like
        microcosms of ontological structure. If psychology students
        were instead introduced to the concepts of typology, it
        wouldn't be so easy to misconstrue the ideas of Jung's
        [Psychological
        Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Types)

- 3️⃣ Neurology: If archetypes and developmental dynamics are
  represented by motifs of neurocircuitry, where form is shared among
  our species, is information that encodes this form persisted through
  #Nature (epi/genetic) or #Nurture (through social information,
  mostly conscious) or #Enigma (Hegelian metaphysical forms emanate
  from the structure of the mind and society’s intersection with the
  unconsious) ... ?!

- 4️⃣ Phenomenology: If the presentation of informational forms related
  through the metaphysical and unconscious result in motifs of
  neurocircuitry, then how much of our brains structure would change
  if the #SpectralComposition of sensory data our mind processed were
  to suddenly change? (i.e. like the Neuro research where a sense like
  sight is mapped from optical nerves to gustatory or auditory cranial
  nerves) Or what is the impact on the mind’s structure in people who
  lack specific senses?)
  - is there any limit on the range of epistemic strucures that can be
    represented

By establishing a #Neuro #Analytic conception of the brain/mind —
i.e. by modeling the brain as an analytic machine and [universal
quantum-information computer]() each of those questions above may beg
answered with at least as much depth as existing thought leaders.

(...), this allows the psychologist and neurologist to bridge Jüng’s
ideas of [analytic psychology]() to neurology

- mention that analytic neurology overlaps with the ideas/motivations
  behind [Neuro-Linguistic Programming]()(NLP) -- no, *not* the
  junk-science, gypsy side-show NLP of charlattan scam-artists; the
  actual ideas of NLP for which the side-show scam-artists provide a
  convenient distraction. (λ), were my own theories of Analytic
  Neurology to be completely developed, then they would encompass NLP
  entirely and provide a language in which most of NLP's
  mechanisms/techniques/results could be explained.

### What is consciousness (round two: ship of theseus)


- how does the electro-ionic spatio-temporal approach to the
  mind/brain divide answer the question of the Ship of Theseus?
  - every "discrete" point in the continuous experience of
    consciousness is a distinct entity technically, where the material
    configuration of awareness-entities have a metric of
    similarity. this can be used to gauge similarity in
    awareness-entity instantiations at different points in time.
    - establish that this distinctness from moment to moment implies
      the sense of awaremenss consciousness is (non-temporal; perhaps
      a different term)
    - if someone is to have a near-death experience, then the entity's
      self-awareness that returns (depending on how dim their light
      became before coming back) would generally be somewhat
      dissimilar along this measure.
      - in fact, every time you sleep and wake, the

    - if someone is beamed up on board the USS Enterprise, then the
      material configuration that results would need a (jolt of
      electricity) to get their electroionic juices flowing. once they
      do, an exact or near-replica would seem to function almost
      entirely the same. to that instantiation of awareness, it would
      be no more separate than...

    - if someone who is beamed up aboard the USS Enterprise has their
      material configuration instead cloned, then depending on whether
      the "beaming" device reads & persists quantum state of
      molecules/ions then the cloned entities awareness may briefly be
      "duplexed" for a single instant, until the quantum state of
      entanglement between molecules in each copy decoheres. until
      this decoheres, each clone may have molecules entangled within
      itself, as well as entanglement pairings shared between the
      clones or between each clone and the beaming mechanism. since
      thermodynamic effects render quantum entanglement insignificant
      and untraceable, this will last a single instant only if the new
      clone is instantaneously materialized or a single instant in the
      accumulating regions of the beamed up clone. regardless, its
      important to recognize this bridge between quantum state of the
      two clones and/or the beaming mechanism. Yes, it sounds like [Wu
      Wu Physics](), since unless the Star Trek beaming mechanism
      operates on the structure of space itself and not matter, this
      defies Thermodynamics: reassembling such an exact replica
      requires an immense amount of energy to counteract entropy.

      - optogenetics (a recently developed, but commonly used
        experimental methodology in genetics research) is an example
        of a mechanism of non-local consciousness, which is much less
        Wu Wu physics.

      - Still, it's critical to examine those instants when the
        material mechanisms yielding awareness in the reconstructed
        clone would partially bridge their state to the source
        individual. because it means that the mechanisms for the sense
        of awareness accompanying consciousness can be non-locallized
        and "forked", if this sense of self-awareness does truly
        extend from (1) a bridge between mind and brain and (2) the
        interface between the dynamical analytical machines of the
        brain and the [universal quantum-information computer]() (UQC)
        that seems to modularly coordinate those analytical machines
        for cognition.

      - therefore, similar to the notion that consciousness is
        non-temporal, a unit of consciousness that arises from the UQC
        can also be non-local -- *briefly* bridged via quantum
        entanglement on the timescale of picoseconds. This quality of
        non-locality must be distinguished from the kind of non-local
        consciousness implied by Wu Wu physics, where unless I'm
        tripping over camoflaged metaphors, entanglement is a kind of
        magic. But this begs the question: if consciousness is mostly
        localized, but its physical mechanisms are spatially
        amorphous, then what is a spatiotemporal unit of
        consciousness? if distributing consciousness across space is
        possible via entanglement *however briefly*, then perhaps each
        material unit representing part of a analytical "thinking
        machines" is itself a unit of consciousness. Without
        meta/physically being causally coupled to a UQC whose
        interface generates the sensation of awareness, such units of
        consciousness are (pointless) individually, but collectively
        can extend the awareness of any mechanism/interface for
        distributing consciousness.

      - And, to dangerously court Wu Wu Physics once again, the entire
        universe is a web of causal channels that distribute
        consciousness via the surface for causal signals offered by
        physical interactions. What distinguishes the material
        universe or some space rock from a human brain? The
        internetworked structure of neurons is specialized for
        distributing causal signals to facilitate action predicated on
        logical systems emulated by anayltical machines -- all
        coordinated via the interface to a UQC, which may be necessary
        for the sensation of highly-localized awareness. Yet,
        critical, is the notion that, for any localized "material
        units" of consciousness, they are neither separate nor do they
        belong to the same precise (instrument) of
        consciousness. Everything is all one, but some
        surfaces/membranes for causal signals are woven more tightly
        together, accelerating the exchange and organizaton of
        information.

        - thus, every mind absorbs physical signals and begins
          accumulating logical state that, given enough time, begins
          to transmute its experience into the reifification of the
          noumenological: the purely metaphysical made physical. once
          infinity can be made certain to exist, then perhaps
          analytical philosophy will have (measured/modeled) the
          noumenon.

        - such is the precipitation of the metaphysical into the
          physical realm and as physical barriers to information
          exchange begin to breakdown. through history information
          exchange gradually increases, widening the gates to
          metaphysical nether-realm from which beautiful and grotesque
          specimens of form emerge. on the eve of the Singularity,
          this precipitation boils over into a Hegelian nightmare.

        - segue => emphasize the intrinsic inseparability of
          consciousness from causality, where higher-levels of
          consciousness begin reifying highly-abstracted phenomena
          that are the manisfestation of noumenological. that is,
          given the exponential expansion of fibers, surfaces and
          membranes for the transmission of causal signals, what
          results are analytical systems which converge towards higher
          levels of abstraction, where signals over the expanded
          causal interface become increasingly coupled to logic and
          epistemic structures.

- When consciousnesses are bridged by some means of physically
  propagating information ... (e.g. I am having a conversation with
  you and can see you) then there is an image of you inside me and
  vice versa. This bidirectional exchange of information is a causal
  bridge between two consciousnesses

# Neuroanalytic Thought Experiments

### Meta/cognitive skills to Enhance

- more specific than what's listed in [epistemology, cognition and
  category theory, pt 3]()


### Describe the Importance of Interpretive & Generative N
etworks

### Differentiating Analytic Neurology

- come up with some more simple neuroanalytic thought experiments,
  stressing some structured meta/cognitive approach to tasks that are
  similar to those below (but not as silly as sorting diodes)

#### Shadow Puppets and The Search-Space of High-Complexity Problems

- while it seems that shadow puppets are a simple means of expression
  for children at summer camp, it is actually a fascinating problem
  related to dimensionality reduction and affine transformations.
  - a popular problem in recent Artificial Intelligence research
    amounts to nothing more than simplifying the search-space of
    "shadow-puppets" ...
    - that is being able to recognize/classify connections in
      structure of objects before/after dimensional reductions, even
      when the dimensionally-reduced objects
    - find a link to this

  - it's actually a very difficult problem, which is why it's a
    perfect neuroanalytic thought experiment for reflecting on
    metacognition. it doubles as a means of identifying extreme
    intelligence, since children who can reason about how to scan the
    search space of shadow puppets projections *without being given
    patterns beforehand* to emulate the shapes of animals must have
    minds capable of fairly sophisticated neural computation.
    - if a child or person is capable of starting from zero and then
      works through the potential solutions for expression through
      dimensional reduction, it means that not only do they possess
      sophisticated intuition for meta/cognition, their minds are also
      innately powerful.

    - once the mind is given several patterns to work from, it is easy
      to find connected solutions. this is why it's important to
      challenge the child or person before they have internalized a
      list of patterns for shadow-puppet solution.

      - furthermore, the complexity of this problem (is beyond P/NP)
        which means it is more efficient for many processes to explore
        the solution-space, identify patterns and communicate about
        them. when nodes leverage socially-distributed computation to
        solve a (> P/NP) problem like this, they each have their own
        analytic representations of the search space and
        problems. then, when some nodes serendipitously discover
        certains solution types and communicate their
        solution-patterns to other nodes, those nodes must decode the
        solution-representations and internalized it according to
        their own analytic representations of shadow puppets.

      - the defect of this approach is that, once someone has given
        you a list of solution-patterns, your analytic representations
        will begin to congeal forever around that core set of patterns
        and the cognitive processes of most people will tend to only
        extrapolate from that set of solutions.

        - this is a neuroanalytic basis for one kind of
          beginners-mind: where the the set of solution-space your
          mind explores for high-complexity becomes rigidly defined as
          soon as you internalize any information -- this
          unconsciously defines diffeomorphic surfaces of for
          solution-space exploration and solution-ideation. before the
          person internalizes any information whatsoever, they may
          identify a completely unique approach to scanning the
          surface space, which results in new basis-patterns. for
          socially-distributed computation approaching
          (high-complexity problems) generally, this means that the
          network as a whole benefits when new nodes added have
          minimal preconceived notions of the search space.

          - *SERENDIPITOUSLY, THEY WILL MIRACULOUSLY DISCOVER
            SOLUTION CONFIGURATIONS WHOSE P(e) OF DISCOVERY IS
            INFINITESSIMAL*
            - since the solutions and patterns in the searchspace are
              usually inter-connected, you need new nodes with no
              pre-existing apprehensions to search their own unique
              direction, before they are tainted by the networks
              preconceptions of the search space.

        - this is another perspective illuminating the deep meaning
          behind my article on [To Catch a Butterfly: Epistemic
          Miracles of
          Serendipity](/posts/2018-03-04-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity.html),
          which opens with a discussion on the importance behind
          diversity of thought in socially-distributed computation!
          - e.g. that butterfly doesn't need you to install your
            unconscious imprint and cripple it's beginner's mind, but
            you may learn from its serendipitous discovery of novel
            solution-patterns

# Phenomena/Mechanisms which are readily explained from a Neuroanalytic perspective

### Priming Neural Circuits

- "priming" neural circuits
  - (mechanism that works via attuning infinitesimally valued events)
    - where neural circuits which have been engaged recently are more
      likely to fire again or to influence the operation of adjacent
      neural circuits.
  - an example of an activity that would use this mechanism: before
    writing, spend 30 minutes of reading aloud an author whose style
    (particularly vocabulary) you want to emulate. for me, this is HP
    Lovecraft.
    - this shouldn't be used to copy an author's style, but instead as
      a method for priming lower-level neural circuits related to
      obscure vocabulary, etc.
    - it won't work for priming usage of higher-order facets of style:
      e.g. Lovecraft's utilization of mixed-media and mixed-source
      secondhand accounts
  - this method of "priming" works to tune infinitesimals in spectral,
    time-series algorithms generally, even in social media newsfeed
    algorithms. e.g. if you want to see more of someone's posts on
    Facebook, view their content frequently and interact with them
    more often. if you go from minimal interactions with a person to
    moderate interactions, then facebook's stream-processing newsfeed
    algorithm is going to attune its values that prioritize that
    person's content to appear in your newsfeed.
    - this is similar to how and why similar tactics of "priming" work
      in the human brain.

### Double Images in Art and Psychology ResearchB

![Pic of Occipital Lobe Pathways]()

- neurological explanation for double images in art (Dali) and
  psych. research ... specifically activations & image classifications
  - explain how the tendency to "lock in" the first image seen is
    explained by the initial set of activations, which primes the
    brain's pathways to continue seeing the first recognized image.
    - to the brain's trained image classification networks report 2+
      classifications whose probabilities are evenly shared, then it
      is more likely for the subconscious to bubble up the other image
      class(es) responsible for activiations in that region.
      - here, if image classification possibilities reported by
        (visuo-object) pathways are moreso evenly distributed across
        multiple pathways, then the "primed" and active circuits are
        less stable and will incentivize cognition to continue
        looking, as though something is missing/incomplete
        - explain confidence in object/phenomena classification
    - on the other hand, borrowing more metaphors from computer vision
      image classification, if one image class is reporting
      probabilities far higher than others (e.g. class A: 90%; class
      B: 8%; C: 1%; ...) then the subconscious is likely to respond by
      holding existing pathway activity stable, leaving the
      consciousness *almost completely* unaware of a possibility for a
      second image.
      - here, the consciousness at most should receive a vague
        sensation that something is missing, if anything at all, but
        is more likely to remain completely unaware of a second image.
      - if the person is told to reevaluate and identify the second
        image, then they can focus their cognition to reengage their
        subconscious to identify further image classes.
        - yet, the strength of the original classification should
          persist cause the mind to experience difficulty in
          overturning the existing primed circuit pathways.

### How an Artist Finds Double Images

- copy/rewrite footnotes on sketches? (from "to catch a butterfly")
  - how to find double images by sketching (why you need to explore
    through sketches and why working with double images is so hard)
  - the main problems with double images in art with realistic or
    expert technique:

#### (1) Sketching & Remaking Pieces Repeatedly

- (1) it usually requires remaking the piece repeatedly, but each
  time, it's difficult to maintain the dependencies for double
  iamges that make them work without trying too hard.
  - when you redo the piece, unless you have granular control over
    where you place elements and how you maintain proportions,
    then your intended direction unwinds and the effect is
    properly received. or ... worse, it looks like everything in
    your piece became contrived around that single element.

#### (2) Depth Effects must be coherent (lighting can be deconstructed)

- (2) features of perceived depth of matching image classes must
  be coherent, not simply the silouettes. why? because neurons
  also leverage design patterns like Capsule Network -- Gregory
  Hinton and other researchers inferred inspiration behind the
  Capsule Network from interleaving neurons whose silicon
  counterparts feed encodings back into themselves, in a
  way. (double check the last part)
  - the addition of lighting can complicate things, but also opens
    up the possibility for "partializing" the intended recognized
    image classes. in this way, you deconstruct the recognized
    features of two image classes, keeping those most
    characteristic to the type of object and discarding the rest.
    - after the constraints have been loosened, its easier to find
      pairs whose partial definitions match.
    - the above technique is almost essential for getting lighting
      to work, since it allows you to toy with how the lighting
      interactions from various sources hit the objects' surfaces
      - here you use the same "partialization" technique to decide
        which surfaces receive light with various light sources.
        - tuning/emphasizing the color of each light source allows
          you to emphasize the characteristics of each intended
          image class across various surfaces.
    - yet, to pull any of this off, you have to have expert
      proficiency in artistic ideation, visualization, lighting,
      color, abstraction and depth, along with enough time and
      patience.

#### (3) greyscale images make double images easy; color makes them hard ####

  - if doodling to explore possibilities, but without color, then
    the double image possibilities you identify won't necessarily
    translate to color easily. ess you have some miraculous instantiation of neural circuits
    the enable you to "mix" image classifications, almost like Google
    Deep Dream running content through the intersection of image
    classification weights.
    - this would be the only way to identify the "rare" image classes
      which result in superimposable

### Algorithm #1:

#### Training an RBM network to produce intersections for pairs of image-classes trained on another network

- train skewed image classification networks (e.g. for the image class
  cars, instead of sampling evenly over all models/years, skew the set
  for older makes that emphasize anthropomorphic features; i.e. the
  front is designed to resemble a face)
- train other non-skewed classes in the same set, but ensure classes
  that present with facial structures are included.
- once your network is trained, reverse the network and, for
  image-class-pairs, intersect their upper-middle tiers of neurons
  using correlation, autocorrelation, tensor-analysis
  (e.g. convolution, antisymmetry, etc)
- another neural network (an RBM?) could drive this process to
  identify parameters of image-class-pair activation to discover
  optimally "mixed function" representing a new class for the mixed
  pair.
- to train this RBM network, the performance of its candidate boltzman
  processes would need a cost function: the original image
  classification algorithm would be run on images for those classes
  (and control classes?) to provide scores for how the new mixed image
  classes improve. poorly performing boltzmann processes for
  mixed-pair-classes would be reset to random or to diverge along the
  gradient of more successful boltzmann processes.
- then, generate blank and random images of various kinds (this needs
  to resemble basic abstract art of some kind, not perlin noise)
- finally, hook the trained mixed-pair-classes into a deep-dream
  pattern and see what comes out. the input images need to be simpler;
  preferably the algorithm can generate its representation
- a goal: can you get the algorithm to produce a 1968 VW beetle with
  cat-ears?

### Algorithm #2: "partializing" image classes

- find some means of deconstruct the upper 2 or 3 tiers of neuron
  weights for some image class, to identify "partial" versions of the
  classes's analytic definitions that can be combined in more
  compositional ways.
- here, you are searching for the "partialized" functions which
  represent the "cat ears" of the cat, which could be applied to other
  image classes so the above "1968 VW beetle with cat-ears" could be
  produced more easily.
- this would be an incredibly powerful technique, but the math is
  ... probably ridiculous. on the other hand, the math in the first
  project idea isn't so bad: it's basically machine learning to screw
  with machine learning results. in the first project, your boltzmann
  processes are essentially wandering around in spaces between image
  pairs. here, if the same RBM (or higher-level network is used), then
  you're doing something similar, but for a single class.
- since analytic networks start with randomized data, every time they
  are trained, they produce completely random weights that still yield
  roughly the same results. each training results in analytical
  solutions that lie along the same surface, but at completely
  different points along that surface. the difficulty in untangling
  image class definitions (to explore it's partial features) is that
  no definition is "separate" from the others: they are all defined in
  terms of their relation to the rest of the system.

### "Partializing" Disentangled Representations of Single Image Classes

- (verify: is this the same thing as a disentangled solutions in
  machine learning? particularly representational learning?)
- with this, a process that successfully trains to capture "untangled"
  representations of image-classes (and perhaps partialized
  definitions as well), then the resulting network/data could be used
  with a deep dream process to produce double images with
  deconstructed lighting effects.

###

- these are really frustrating tasks to attempt, if meta/cognitively
  reasoning about them in the intended manner. not only does the
  wetware in the human brain seem unable to naturally reorient itself
  to these metacognitive approaches, it usually seems impossible.
  - however, if one succeeds in expanding meta/cognitive
    skills/coordination, then major leaps in intelligence could be
    expected. these would correspond


- if approached in these ways when 4-10 years old, then the brain
  would be much more capable of adapting to these approaches. if the
  ideas of analytic neurology are correct, then if at a young age, one
  excels at these extremely abstract metacognitive approaches to
  operating the brain, then one is likely to develop extreme
  intelligence. still, not only is it difficult to assert that a child
  is cognitively approaching these tasks with the intended
  metacognition, if indeed they are to do so, it is also difficult to
  train adults to recognize such *and* it is difficult to communicate
  the instructions behind these thought experiments to children, while
  disguising them as games.
  - it is unclear which is the greater challenge:
    - (1) convince children young enough to be profoundly impacted by
      neuroanalytic meta/cognitive skills development exercises that
      engaging in them is fun.
    - (2) accurately convey the instructions behind these exercises
      (perhaps disguised as games)
  - it's important to emphasize that some puzzle games embody these
    ideas. however, it's not simply completing the exercise(s) that is
    important -- regardless of the score, were they packaged as puzzle
    games. only by completing the exercises *while expanding both the
    number and strength of tools available in mind's metacognitive
    wheelhouse* will be effective in producing moderate to extreme
    leaps in intelligence. and if it's not natural for children or
    adolescents to apply these metacognitive tools and cognitive
    perspectives to other activities, then any activated cognitive
    patterns of coordination of neural pathways will not become
    systematic. the goal should be to identify activities that tend to
    produce rare, non-typical lower-level neural circuits patterns and
    to strengthen higher level modular coordination of those
    circuits/pathways via expanded meta/cognitive skills.
    - it's also important to structure these in a non-serious way,
      otherwise it may come across as "toying with children's minds",
      which is not what I intend whatsoever. instead, these are moreso
      like more advanced Luminosity games that focus specifically on
      tools and coordination of meta/cognition.
    - first and foremost, they are thought experiments.

### First Thought Experiment: Non-Linear Speed Reading

- Reading horizontal text (left to right or right to left) and parsing
  grammatical elements out of sequence. In other words, you are
  scanning the text and deferring the gramatical parsing of three
  lines of text as a time. Each line of text is still scanned, but you
  are pulling in text from the next lines as you are reading the
  current line. When your eyes reach those next lines, your
  subconscious mind has prepared monoidal CCG structures representing
  the partial context of the incoming subsequent line. So this next
  line's space is already filtered by that grammatical partial
  context.
  - How can the grammar of the visually consumed quasi-sentences and
    fragments be monadically modeled as in higher-order dual spaces of
    CCG-trees? It can't. Not by humans.
    - now that I understand more about the computational complexity of
      combinatorial problems involving category theory, it seems that
      non-linear speed reading would be impossible for humans. For
      space-lizards whose brains contain a connection to a planet-wide
      quantum computing cloud in the molter core for the earth?
      Perhaps not impossible.
- Since it's possible, this is merely a thought experiment on
  metacognition related to maximizing the computational efficiency of
  reading. How could one get the mind to cognitively coordinate the
  subconscious to read with this process instead of the normal process
  bounded by single lines of ingestion? From a computer science
  perspective, this would be parallel; though the processes which are
  ingesting lines seem to be concurrent, parallelism is acheived.
  - Once you've metacognitively reasoned about reading in this way,
    the next step is to try to get your mind to accomplish this,
    though I'm not presenting these thought experiements as though
    they are possible. While you're trying non-linear speed reading,
    you should observe your own cognition to collect subjective
    information to leverage to deduce how your mind operates
    generally.
  - (Doing so) is much easier when the mind is challenged because you
    can "feel" it butt up against various limitations. Though these
    facets and edifaces which constrain your cognition are invisible
    and convoluted by each faculty's modularity, it's still possible
    to make useful inferences from such purely subjective aspects of
    your experience. This facilitates inductive reasoning to form
    hypothesis about neurological experiementation and the methods to
    validate them.

- This was an approach to speed-reading that was briefly suggested to
  me in "memories" of conversations with Tatiana. After prompting me
  with it, she quickly jumped to the next topic.  Whenever people
  "handle" me like this, it accomplishes the opposite result: I think
  about my sudden shift in focus and the implications of whether it is
  intentional. I know when my eyes are being led around and I know
  when I've fallen into a pot full of honey...



### (So, the second/third Neuroanalytic Thought Experiment #2 & #3)

- #2: sorting colored pencils by brand
  - describe the task and the motivations behind the metacognitive
    approach to thinking about modularly leveraging your mind to
    achieve distributed (concurrent) computer vision.
  - so, the idea is to try to reason about structuring thought around
    the task, knowing that if a computer were to approach the same
    task, more efficient methods would be available to it: namely, the
    utilization of concurrency.
    - the metacognitive meditation of the "sorting colored pencils"
      task is to train the mind to dynamically spread it's focus onto
      visual elements in ways that are moreso connected to the logic
      of the task items instead of directing visual focus in the
      manner that humans accustomed to doing.
    - (in other words), instead


- This may sound silly, but is a pretty difficult #ComputerVision
  problem to solve in software, but by imagining how to imitate such a
  software design in the brain, we can infer a lot of information
  about how our optical pathways process visual data, as well as what
  the limits are. Also, when doing this, it is unreasonably hard to
  operate your mind to subjectively process these if they are not
  aligned in the same direction... which is an example of a fantastic
  question to ask that has neuroanalytic implications => Why is it
  easier for your brain to process the image data and yield an answer
  when the diodes are lined up? The overly general answer: your brain
  is an analytical machine.

#### 1️⃣ attempt to operate your brain’s low level optical pathways...

- to identify whether one of these components has the same distinct
  #ProductNumber, without moving them within the bag

#### 2️⃣ Imagine this as an exercise in cutting and gluing the textures...

- from the cylindrical #Diode surfaces to identify any part with a
  code that is not shared by the rest of the group

#### 3️⃣ If you're familiar with techniques from #ComputerVision...

- like the #WatershedAlgorithm and #MorphologicalOperators, imagine
  how your brain preprocesses visual data en route to the
  #OccipitalLobe.

#### 4️⃣ Once the processed signals reach the #OccipitalLobe...

- then your brain uses #Spatiotemporal methods to process the visual
  data to sub/consciously identify facts & info to extract, yet you
  can conscious operate your brain to alter how this proceeds. **And
  this is the most important implication** In order to identify
  whether the diodes are of only one type or there are multiple types
  of diode included (without moving the diodes in the bag) your brain
  can to "cut & paste" images from the cylinders, while also
  identifying diodes that present with indistinct and ambiguous
  partial codes (e.g. the letters "IN" are used on many types) So this
  algorithm/process can be unsolvable, but your brain can tag regions
  of this visual image as "unsolvable" without interaction.

### Questions

- FINALLY, some questions that result from the thought experiment:

- 1️⃣ Does the shape of the diodes/components affect the hardness of the
  problem? (Yes, but why? because for cylindrical diodes, your brain
  cannot make assumptions about the regularity of the image of the
  objects. this makes the problem less tractible, as the specific
  orientation of the cylinders is always ambiguous)

- 2️⃣ Does the manner in which you choose to operate your mind cause you
  to engage different sets of neural circuits? (Also, yes: since the
  cylindrical shape of the diodes doesn't allow you to see the entire
  label of any of them at once, you either must ( 1 ) "stitch" images
  together in your mind to form a complete reference #Texture, then
  try to fit sub-images into that reference image, like pieces of a
  puzzle, which is impossible for me or ( 2 ) process the sub-images
  from each cylinder that are visible for Letters/Numbers to find some
  that don't match the known code (in this case IN4007), which is the
  process I have to take to resolve the ambiguity

### To Summarize

- While this all sounds dumb to put on instagram, reasoning about how
  your mind directs the lower-level circuitry of your brain, allows
  you to make interesting inferences about how the brain operates as
  an analytical machine. Feeling out the limitations imposed on the
  brain by intractible approaches to everyday IRL tasks gives you a
  ton of information about how information is processed.

- (sorry, this is going in my draft on a #NeuroAnalytical conception
  of the brain/mind ... but it's what i'm thinking about at the
  moment, so i'm putting it online LOL ... I've been working on that
  article (and others) for like 5 months and there's just too much
  content for me to handle. I'm just lucky that i managed to not
  discuss the #Unconscious in these rambing instagram posts.



## Leonardo and How Mirrored Writing Expands the Mind

- this is the perfect idea for opening an introduction to analytic
  neurology.

Leonardo da vinci wrote backwards, (but only bc he was left-handed and
didn't want dirty handwriting.) increasing efficiency/flexibility of
visual/symbol recognition expands the mind, neuroanalytically, by
forcing your neural circuits to convolute and renetwork themselves
into more advanced information-processing forms. this information
processing capability must be backed by an encoding of the
metaphysical into material structure of your neural circuits. most
people do not bother to trudge through learning how to use their mind
like this. it is not a coincidence that Leonardo da Vinci wrote in
this way and was so intelligent.

- describe the connections between generative networks and
  (interpretative) networks, but why generative networks are so much
  more important and more connected.
  - use guitar vs. guitar hero as an example
    - although find another app that is closer to guitar/piano than
      guitar hero
  - to advance in Guitar Hero, you have to become fairly proficient at
    rhythm, though the games tolerance is forgiving.
    - in the end, do you learn to generate those rhythms?
  - why does it seem like any knowledge or skills gained by playing
    (guitar hero) is superficial? it doesn't seep into your mind and
    doesn't reinforce skils related to actually playing music. why?
    - you are training and reinforcing primarily reactive skills,
      without streaming any signals through neural circuits
      responsible for proactively generating the content.
    - if you have a modular theory of mind, then this comprehensively
      changes the physical manisfestation of signals streaming through
      your brain. they don't need to modularly coordinate with any of
      the generative networks. it's like half your mind is running; in
      terms of machine learning, these are purely
      (classification/and?) tasks; there is no need to "think" and all
      you have to do is react to trigger the rhythms within the level
      of tolerance permitted. for rhythms with many fast notes, the
      player actually has a ton of tolerance to work within,
      proportaional to the length of the smaller units of notes. The
      the scoring system doesn't adjust for this enough, to make you
      feel good about playing fast stuff. In real music, it doesn't
      work like this at all.

- your mind is not engaging the same pathways whatsoever when you play
  drums or play drums on guitar hero. at all. they are almost entirely
  separate. you're not thinking about driving the sound or about the
  subtle facets of technique which will have a huge effect on how a
  listener might perceive your expression.

  - the neural circuits responsible for this stuff just are not
    engaged whatsoever when you're playing Guitar Hero, so there
    should be zero expectation that playing will improve your musical
    skills. Truthfully, you need some knack for rhythm to beat it with
    drums, but it doesn't help you gain anything.


- what does any of this have to do with Leonardo Da Vinci's mirrored,
  left-hand handwriting? And expansive symbol-recognition?
  - connect to a modular theory of language/mind.
  - ![image of optical processing pathways]() from Optic Nerve through
    Occipital Lobe. (imagine connecting these pathways to langauge,
    but that the mid-tier symbol recognition centers are more
    expansively built out.
    - now, imagine that you are forced to not only write in mirrored
      handwriting, but you are the only individual to do so and that
      you prefer to write in script that corresponds to the scripts in
      society through a simple 2D/3D LINEAR TRANSFORMATION, which
      neural networks are EXCELLENT at recognizing.


### Expansive Symbol Recognition

- increasing the occipital lobe's range of neural pathways which
  correspond to grapheme-semiotic activation.
  - explain why this is helpful in expanding intelligence.
  - explain more: while writing systems with more complicated
    orthography are harder to learn, they have more profound impacts
    on the structure of the mind, especially when someone learns
    multiple writing systems.

- counterexamples: why would mirrored handwriting expand the mind
  so profoundly when these don't:
  - reading from multiple orientations
  - ambidextruous writing
  - kanji/hanja/kiangxi writing system
  - linguisits and polyglots

- the answer is two-fold:
  - (1) recognizing mirrored handwriting (connect this to more
    perfect/complete solutions of analytical systems that represent
    linear transformations on glyphs)
  - (2) while writing with both regular and mirrored forces, you are
    *generatively* engaging the handwriting recognition circuits in your
    mind, which compels these circuits to embody more refined
    analytical systems representing all affine transformations on
    latin glyphs. the impact of having or not having these low-level
    structures in visual-symbol recognition pathways reverberates
    through the brain/mind as a modular analytical machine.

- how can you prove this?
  - (1) by studying the differences between machine learning that
    recognizes both mirrored and non-mirrored handwriting and normal
    handwriting recognition systems.
    - however, there may be some constraints on the hypothesis/methods
      used for experiments to prove this, otherwise results would seem
      inconclusive.
    - i.e. the neural networks constructed/trained need to focus on
      emulating *compete* representations of all linear/affine
      transformations on latin glyphs, while being capable of
      recognizing strings of cursive glyphs (both non/mirrored)
    - since the brain is a modular analytical machine, where structure
      is dispersed through the brain (e.g. you'll hear that the
      neurons are connected in up to 11 dimensions), detecting
      patterns differences in MRI/etc imagery that would distinguish
      the brains of people who utilize mirrored handwriting styles is
      likely ineffective. also, since people who do so are so rare,
      this would bias the data towards inconclusive results, if you
      could get past the difficulties in imagery.
  - (2) to informally test whether this is effective is by learning to
    read/write mirrored kanji left-handed. since an analytical
    representation of affine transformations expanded to such a vast
    set of symbols must be even more expansive/comprehensive, then it
    more strenuously tests the hypothesis.
    - however, any results would be anecdotal. they need to be
      performed voluntarily at a young age to show results, since it
      is the development of this skill of mirrored writing in a young,
      undeveloped mind that allows the brain to neurally congeal
      around it.

- for Da Vinci, it's the synergy between expanding *representational
  networks* in the brain that represent complete solutions for affine
  transofrmations of symbols the *generative* application of those
  networks, that resulted in expanding his intelligence. according to
  a neuroanalytical conception of the divide between the brain and the
  mind, there are many anomolous "keys" to unlocking greatly expanded
  intelligence. these are primarily the specific cognitive approach to
  skills, which may not be the most effective approach for solving a
  problem or utilizing a skill, but for whatever reason, anomolously
  expand the mind to develop intelligence.

- How does this correspond to Da Vinci's handwriting? In comparison,
  why is merely expanding orthographic recognition with more symbols
  still deficient? From a neuro-analytic perspective, why does the
  increased pathway inter-connection for mirrored writing require more
  profound effects to the brain's visual-processing interface with the
  rest of the brain?
  - it is because of the highly diverse neural activations associated
    with reading and writing in a person who voluntarily engages in
    mirrored writing, especially from a young age.
  - These pathway activations are distinctly different in a huge way
    and over time have a major impact on the structure of the brain's
    visuolinguistic pathways. Sure, I've presented very little
    evidence, but that will all soon emerge from data science
    connecting psychology to in-depth analysis of neural pathways from
    MRI or SPION imagery. The implication is that the way you use your
    brain, how you choose to structure cognition and the younger you
    are when you develop various components of cognitive approach has
    a major impact on how individuals skills manifest in a person,
    which corresponds to physical differences in the brain.

# Education, Early Childhood, Healthy Social Interaction and ...

- (Understanding the neuroanalytic perspective on the neurological
  aspects of psychological development underscores the mistakes of)
  taking art, music, etc out of primary/secondary education. it is
  essential for developing (structured cognition) that is both
  (interpretive) and (generative)

### *Don't* Slash Educational Budgets


  - in fact, we need more of these programs. we need after-school
    programs to engage kids in these positive pursuits that help us
    develop our minds early on. every primary and secondary classroom
    should have one or two teaching assistants on staff. Why? Because
    a single teacher should be expected to dedicate ZERO TIME to
    disciplinary issues and maintain class-room order. This is
    especially true in tougher schools (like the ???  program covers.
    You'll find adding a second person resolves 90% of any
    disruptions, simply because -- SOCIAL PHYSICS.  However, these
    additional teaching assistants should NOT be thought of as
    disciplinary grunts because they should be hired as adjunct staff
    **foremost**, to facilite adult-child interaction, which is purely
    bounded by a single teacher and a 30 to 1 teacher to child
    ratio. This ratio should be 5 to 1, but 10 staff members to every
    child would be reasonable for the budget.
    - This sounds expensive?! I posit that it is expensive in the
      long-term to *NOT* invest these resources in childred. Further,
      our economy is going to be strained and we will need to
      reallocate resources to compensate for unemployment.
    - By analogy, if such teaching assistants parallel nurses under
      doctors in the hierarchy of authority, then it means that staff
      may be hired without needing needing an education major as a
      college graduate -- or perhaps they would only need a two year
      degree.

#### Think of the Children? Ummm ... Think of the Economy!

- When automation first leads to rising unemployment, federal and
  state governments will need a mild form of [Employer of Last
  Resort]() to artificially increase supply of jobs to maintain higher
  levels of employment. Yes, it's Keynesian economics. Technically,
  that's all that ELR programs are: you're paying people to dig holes,
  so they can fill them in again. This all falls under the government
  budget, which simply means we damn well sure better get our value
  out of the budget expenditures, which is why UBI programs are a sick
  joke: they don't deliver anything but idealistic hope of value
  returns.
  - Instead, by systematically increasing the student-to-teacher ratio
    in classrooms across america -- and by NOT slashing arts programs
    -- then we will end up with a smarter, more diversely employable
    youth population. This means that the initial impacts of the
    automation crisis like employment rates disrupted across economic
    segments will be aided by having a young population that is more
    widely skilled that can be dynamically reallocated.
    - Yes, this is expensive, but realisticially sizing up the crisis
      we will encounter less than two decades from now, can we afford
      not to seek to improve metrics like student-to-teacher ratio and
      diversity of skill? NOW is the time to act. Sadly, the *only*
      solutions which will help are those with long-term payoff. There
      are very few effective short-term policy responses to the
      automation crisis. We will either be ready for it, or we may end
      up tearing ourselves apart.

### Activating Meta/Cognition in Early Childhood Development and Adolescence

(segue ... This is why) presenting the child's mind with the right
approaches for deconstructing information and constructing cognition
provides a set of "initiation"-like methods for nudging the child's
mind in the correct direction to develop intelligence. If you "awaken"
certain methods of meta/cognition while providing the child with
incentives for consistently reinforcing specific cognitive methods,
then these tools will feel more natural as they develop. Done
correctly, the the child will continue to engage in problem solving by
independently leveraging these meta/cognitive methods in dynamic and
modular ways. They won't necessarily understand why they approach new
problems in creative ways, they just will. When the mind is young,
reinforcement has a greater effect on a mind that is far more
flexible. The younger people are when they strengthen these
meta/cognitive methods, the more natural they feel and the more likely
that subsequent evolution of the brain as an analytical machine will
structure itself around a dense core of meta/cognitive intelligence.

###

Children that lack interaction as babies and toddlers is an extreme
example of the opposite of this idea. Research shows that
intergenerational interaction with uncles, grandparents and other
family members is correlates with higher intelligence. When you lack
interaction, you're presented less often with new perspectives and
methods of cognition. Children and adolescents that lack interaction
or other components of psychological development feel unconsciously
compelled to seek them out elsewhere. They don't usually know what
they're looking for, *but they will look for something*, which makes
them unwisely dependent on people outside the family who may be
untrustworthy. However, a younger person may neither have a strongly
developed values system nor may they have tools to vet new social
connections, especially if they don't receive enough exposure to those
skills for whatever reason: sometimes parents try to over-protect
their children from some facets of life, unaware that they're leaving
their children more vulnerable. As a parent, you need to encourage
your child to engage in a diverse set of experiences: independently;
in a safe environment; making their own choices and dealing with the
consequences.

###

Sadly, the "Nuclear family" of the 1950's disrupted extended family
living situations; however, bankers who wanted to accelerate demand
for housing bloated the price of real-estate by pulling the family
unit apart and, perhaps incidentally, gained money and power. The
spread of Nuclear family units had a huge impact on rates of
adult-child interaction and other sociophysical metrics like breadth
of information exposure: in childhood and adolescence, if you live
with more people, they are connected to a larger network and thus you
will receive and process a more broad set of information and
perspectives; dynamics that have evolved with broadband internet to be
sure.

Today, you simply cross your fingers and hope that politicized
newsfeed algorithms will teach your child which piercings are
appropriate, among other critical lifestyle decisions that no
artificial intelligence could ever get horribly wrong -- as judged
from the perspective of the parents and family. To be sure, neither
strongly defined values nor judgement (cast by people with mindful
awareness of circumstances, open minds and open hearts) are always
toxic. The opposite is seen: societies are self-corrupting that are
devoid of people with strongly developed values and morals or who do
not have pronounced, shared systems of values. Both diversity of moral
system and social consensus on values are critical to the next
generation's apprehension of morality: *when this swings out of
balance, it is an example of the collective unconscious emanating into
sociophysical systems, thereby stirring society to self-correct the
lack of balance.*

What social liberals don't understand about social conservatives:
people have a right to build diverse communities with different sets
of values and families have a right to raise their children according
to the set of values that they and their children come to see as
correct. If you describe yourself as someone who vigorously defends
diversity, then that previous sentence should make your head explode.

There is no "perfect" answer; still, deciding on the right moment to
introduce a child to specific topics, ideas, mindsets or lifestyles
should be a decision for the family to make; not some algorithm; not
an untrustworthy person introduced into your child's life because they
sought something not found in nearby healthy social outlets; not
circumstances induced by poverty and overworking parents in a
community that lacks adequate afterschool programs after having their
budgets slashed.

- TODO: move the section on how it's impossible for parents to not
  understand some psychological concepts, albeit intuitively.

- Sure, in the Nature vs. Nurture argument, epi/genetics helps quite a
  bit. However, for plastic neural networks like the circuits and
  pathways of the human mind, the specific information processed
  coupled to the structure of approach used to destructure and
  restructure it has a far greater impact than psychology and
  neurology seem to realize.
  - That is -- and this will satisfy Hegelian philosophers and
    Buddhists quite a bit -- your mind primarily adapts to
    metaphysical structures that are pre-eminent. It does so by
    constructing its own images of those metaphysical structures,
    which ontologically correspond to deconstructions and typological
    permutations of invisible metaphysical forms which are
    pre-eminant. So, as for the Hegelian and Marxist Metaphysicists,
    both sides are somewhat correct, since it's recursive, but
    truncate the recursion in an inductive mathematic proof and you'll
    see the Hegelian conception of metaphysics provides the forms to
    which the materially derived Marxist forms converge.

# A Neuroanalytic Perspective on Shakespeare and other Dead Poets



### Why Writing With Meter At The Forefront (Expands Your Skill At Writing)

- for the same reason that artificially-imposed constraints in some
  art/skill tend to expand your creativity
  - circumventing/transcending those constraints force you to
    constantly search *outside of your comfort zone*, since most of
    your default, go-to behaviors/etc don't allow you to complete the
    task/art at hand while satisfying the constraints

- by developing the deftness of wit and (...) to overcome the
  artificial imposition of the adherence to literary devices and
  particularly meter throughout some literary work that reinforces, an
  author must adapt their neural pathways to constantly reinforce what
  typically lies outside their wheelhouse.
  - after developing sufficient flexibility to retain meter and
    literary devices, this "deftness" of
    articulation/wit/expressiveness engrains itself at the
    subconscious level into the author's approach to writing
  - examples of neural circuits whose reinforcement is made more
    frequent by adherence to meter and literary devices:
    - (1) flexibility with permuting grammatical structure
      -
    - (2) usage of nuanced vocabularily, resulting in a wider Zipf's
      distribution for that work and eventually a greater spread for
      that author's Hapax Legamenon (the set of words the author only
      ever uses once across their entire body of work or in one
      particular work)
      - in order to satisfy constraints of iambic/etc meter, you need
        to find words with alternative stress patterns, with a
        specific length of syllables. computationally, this is a
        harder problem. neurally, linguistic pathways connected must
        adapt to artificially imposed expansion of computational
        hardness, which doesn't simply expand in terms of `O(n)`
        temporal complexity, but also the `S(n)` Spatial complexity
        element.
      - The benefits for an author's mind that derive from changes to
        the task's hardness are mostly related expanding the Spatial
        complexity of tasks. Given that the mind is an analytic
        machine with dynamically rewired modular behavior, this
        expansion of spatial complexity (i.e. the search space) with
        additional constraints imposed cause the mind to physically
        distributed the computational load to engage a wider swath of
        neural representations of linguistic data.
      - In the end, the brain must engage more of itself to satisfy
        the mind's demands, but since human wetware also comes bundled
        with its own biophysical demands for energy consumption,
        nutrient distribution and limitations on the mechanisms
        thereof which replentish those biophysical resources -- this
        means the brain's distribution of the taskload across a
        greater physical neurological space in the brain comes with
        two advantages:
        - (1) it increases the spread of neural circuits that are
          engages by the author, which causes those circuits to shift
          epigenetic machinery responsible for upregulating those
          neurons -- this parallels the "cost/reward" mechanisms of
          artificial intelligence. therefore, the author's skill for
          rhyme, meter and wordplay should expand faster. thereby,
          this enables those neural circuits and pathways to
          interweave themselves more tightly and reinforce themselves
          through expanded interconnection. This results in more
          overdetermined information systems in the mind;
          neurologically, overdetermined information systems are
          robust, more powerful and more adaptive.
        - (2) it distributes and shifts the taskload across the
          interior of the brain. this, to some extent, must result in
          smarter, more efficient nutrient/energy consumption by
          biophysical processes in the brain! thereby, the author
          should be able to write longer, with less burnout, with
          fewer need for breaks.
          - no, citations were not included above, which are
            desperately needed. however -- were these biophysical and
            mechanisms to have such significance as to to scale with
            qualitative, observable results; none of which is clear --
            methodologies to research this quantitatively would still
            be difficult to develop, implying a scarcity of citations
            of any kind.
          - that is not to say that clear research with clear data is
            not necessary to make such claims about Da Vinci's
            mirrored handwriting or the nuance of Shakespeare and
            Co.'s prodigious development as English author(s)...

- still, if the neuro-analytic conception of the brain & mind divide
  are correct, the

# Genetic Factors Influencing Intelligence

- It's not Nature or Nurture, it's how our mind's process
  information...
  - this is what results in the most profound changes to the structure
    of lower-level neural circuits, as well as higher level
    coordination of meta/cogntion

### All that we are is the result of what we have thought

Consider the divide between the brain and the mind as an
inter-face. Visualize the brain as a complex river with many channels,
canals and gates. Imagine there are many levels to this metaphor:
there are microcosms and macrocosms. This river's water levels can
raised and lowered. This interface is similar to a river bed eroding
over time in response to to the velocity and volume of water flowing
through it. How you choose to engage your mind opens and closes gates,
diverts fluid through canals, and channels varying volumes of water to
various segments of this river.

What results: changing the flow of water impacts the movement and
distribution of volumes of water, its velocity and its
vorticity. Similar to processes in fluid dynamics and erosion, then if
you consistently engage your mind in a confined manner, where the
gates and canals are fixed in place, then erosion takes its toll and
even if you open different gates, water flows through these segments
of the river, similarly impacted by the changes to the brain's river
bed. After years, the water tends to form the similar surface ripples,
similar swirls and hint at similar undercurrents around the same
obstacles along the river, all emerging from long-term changes in the
surface of the river's bed from erosion.

This metaphor is not so different from understanding the Buddhist
maxim:

> All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded
> on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or
> acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows
> the foot of the ox that draws the carriage... If a man speaks or
> acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that
> never leaves him.

Zooming out, the brain's neurological structure adapts to how you
choose to engage your mind. The effects of repeated cognitive
patterns, especially given intense focus on specific objects of
thought are very similar to how the process of erosion would impact
the flow of water. In the brain, water is everywhere and the motion of
its solutes is governed by [hydrostatics]() and
[osmotics](). Nutrients arrive by capillary and are filtered through
the blood brain barrier. In contrast to the river described above,
whether water flows from source to sink, there are many types of flows
in the brain. There are four major ions, whose changes in distribution
are determined by how ion-channels are gated; its this change in
voltage that causes neurons to fire; in turn, these spikes of
electricity impact the distributions around the surfaces of the
neuron.

In the neuroanalytical description of brain-mind divide, thoughts are
not pared one-to-one with neural structures or encoded as information
on internal neural structures. Instead, thoughts and information are
encoded *spatiotemporally* as patterns of fluid flow through through
various surface features of neural networks and gating
mechanisms. There are two main flows of signals: electrical and
ionic. Encoded into the spectral distributions and harmonics of
wave-like interactions between electrical and flows are
representations of thoughts and ideas. Therefore, by changing the
structure and interconnection of neurons, the riverbed changes,
shifting the flow of these ionic and electrical signals. To be sure,
there are other means of encoding and persisting information within
the brain. Yet, as for the most immediate representation of state and
epistemic structures, this lives within the spectra of waves,
primarily those of ionic and electrical signals, that flow through
neural circuits. This makes our thoughts like spirits that live within
self-perpetuating forms in the surface of a river, in dust-devils and
like the other dryads and nymphs of nature.

There are several strata of state-preservation in the brain, ranging
from immediate and short-term to medium and long-term. As patterns of
thought become more consistent and coherent, then state becomes
persisted in longer-term tiers. The physical structure of neural
networks seems to be a long-term mechanism of state-preservation,
where neural surfaces and interconnections funnel ion flows and impact
their corresponding electrical flows. As dendrites and axons of
neurons adjust to patterns of (electroionic) flows, their structure
allows fluid dynamics with similar harmonics and dispersion
characteristics to emerge: thus their structure encourages similar
spectral components of information to re-emerge.

There is much more to be described from this perspective of the
interface between brain and mind ... depending on how well it pares to
experimental observation. As one last note, what is clear: if the
spectral and harmonic aspects of (electroionic) fluid flows does
correspond to components of deconstructed informational
representations, then *this* is a basis for quantum-information
algorithms at an extremely low level in the human brain. It's not
quantum mechanical; it's quantum-informational

### Genetic Factors Are Less Relevant Than Most People Believe

- in anomolous CI/TE's and epigenetic configurations, there are a few
  psychological faculties that are expanded/altered by genetics, but
  their occurance is mostly anomolous and not linked to visually
  identifyable phenotypes.
  - these include genetic factors related to photographic memory,
    other savant-like memory abilities, synesthetic blending of senses
    - these are all minor factors, but in various academic and
      professional fields, can make cognitive load seem much
      lighter. pianists may be able to memorize ten times the pieces
      as their peers or someone may memorize 10,000 digits of pi.
    - **ironically, it is when you do not recognize the limitations of
      your brain and meta/cognition that you mostly remain unconscious
      to them**
      - therefore, when environmental factors, like early childhood
        head trauma, or genetic factors impose constraints of
        processing/memory onto cognitive processes, the limitations of
        your mind become more clear to you than when there are no
        limitations.
      - you may struggle with neurological faculties, like short-term
        or working memory, resulting in abnormal coordination of
        neural pathways for cogntion
      - this can profoundly change how your brain as an analytical
        machine approaches

### It's Unclear Whether Advantageous Genetic Mutations Are Expressed in your Children

  - genes are activated randomly
  - it's not clear whether these can even be passed down to subsequent
    generations. depending on which genetic network and specific genes
    which compose it, then body randomly activates one or both copies
    of genes in the chromosomes. this is most profoundly seen in
    X-inactivation in female mammals, where all of the genes on one
    X-chromosome will be deactivated -- which are changes
    epigenetically passed down to the cell's descendents. This
    occasionally allows one copy of *different* X-chromesomes to
    remain active, resulting in phenomena like heterochromia.
    - most genetic networks are not impacted by X-inactivation and
      thus, which gene copy is active, if not both depends on the
      network at hand. For example, a single bad copy of the
      Huntington's gene results in the disease because both copies are
      used.
    - RNA-polymerase binds to transcription factors and transcribes
      multiple genes at once, generally executing the same length of
      genetic regions repeatedly for a specific transcription factor.
      therefore, for a genetic network of multiple genes on the same
      chromosome, when RNA-polymerase begins transcribing it, it will
      tend to execute one chromosome's instructions at a time.
    - this implies that anomolies related to CI/TE's may or _may not_
      be activated in children who have copies of those genes, but
      typically it is impossible to know which gene copies are active
      for local neighborhoods of genetic networks expressed together.
      - when a CI/TE mutation creates a frameshift, sometimes RNA
        polymerase will miss the [stop coding]() instructions. it will
        continue transcribing adjacent genes that are not normally
        associated with that genetic network's local neighborhood on
        that chromosome. this is one reason CI/TE mutations can result
        in a profound effect on genetic expression, resulting in
        qualitative/quantitative changes to phenotypes.
      - One vector for colon cancer occurs when a copy-and-paste
        mechanism is repeated too often in colon tissue. similar to
        CI/TE mutations, this mechanism copies large regions of genes
        around to different chromosomes to upregulate genes necessary
        in the colon. As described above, this occasionally causes
        RNA-polymerase to continue transcribing, where it misses a
        stop-coding instruction and either begins coding
        tumor-promotion factors or limiting tumor suppression genes.
    - this all sounds overly complicated, but the point is: when there
      is one copy of a transcription neighborhood activated for a
      segments of a genetic network, **its selection is usually
      random** and therefore, even if you children have some of your
      genes, it is impossible to tell which ones are active.

- genetic factors influencing intelligence (this is important for
  pushing back against genetic arguments for influencing cognition)
  - why? intellgence is a quality derived moreso from *how* we learn
    to operate our brain and organize our knowledge. it is much less
    about genetics proper. The main differences whose origins are
    genetic would arise from chromosome inversion & translocation
    events (CI/TE's) which effect networks of genes on single
    chromes. But only handful of chromosome reversal/rearragement
    events with the potential to impact intelligence and neural
    development since the last glacial maximum (LGM: 100,000 years)
    would be close enough to transcription factors and genes relevant
    to neurology. Why use the date of the LGM? It's when human
    migrations expanded; before this time, any large-chromosome
    reversals would be mostly geographically contained by the ice age;
    furthermore, social behavior was limited during the ice age and
    especially large-scale sociological phenomena like trade,
    commerce, metallurgy, architecture, religion, etc. Since none of
    these had emerged, few mutations until 10,000 years ago would
    produce competitive advantages. Finally, until the Holocene Era
    (10,000 BC), human populations practiced no agriculture and thus
    were strictly bounded by the populations of food sources. So, the
    effects of mutations, especially neurologically relevant .

    Why are CI/TE's more neurologically relevant than mutations of
    individual genes? Because individual mutations in a gene's exon --
    the coding region -- are almost always harmless and pointless,
    unless they occur in areas that are functionally relevant to the
    gene, in which case they will almost certainly cause harm instead
    of conferring an advantage. Most mutations that the layperson
    associates with genetics -- that is, being caused by DNA broadly
    -- are not the typical changes in DNA they first bring to
    mind. These misconception yields a serious sociological kind of
    existential crisis -- they believe "I am born with my DNA, it
    decides who I am" when this couldn't be further from the truth.
    That misconception is a false paradigm; it causes the average
    person to believe they are trapped by the fate of their DNA when
    really, they are trapped by how they understand DNA in relation to
    their body's fate. Instead most "genetic" mutations with
    observable consequences are one of two phenomena: (1) they are
    CI/TE's or (2) changes in transgenerational epigenetic
    markers. Everything from hair color to freckles to average foot
    size to skin color and so on derive from one of these two
    factors. The same can be said about phenotypes related to the
    neurological components of intelligence.

    However, it's important to state that humans on every continent
    have made far more progress in the past 3,000 years than in the
    previous 3 million years. Therefore, the development of new
    cultural universals -- and also the development of metallurgy, of
    architecture, of commerce, of art, of mythology and of religion --
    each one of these has had more impact on humanity as a whole and
    of any social group than all of the genetic mutations in the past
    100,000 years combined, which is an understatement. How our minds
    develop has almost to do with genetics -- except in limited cases,
    which to emphasize does not correspond to racial group or
    ethnicity. One of the only critical genetic features for
    intelligence? The conservation of anatomic features related to
    langauge, speech and the universiality of a common set of
    phonemes, which is only critical for intelligence by consequence
    of being universal.

    Furthermore, since epigenetics is so critical in tuning genetic
    expression, such false paradigms of DNA and genetic-predestiny not
    only trap individuals in their own reactions to genetics, but --
    when such misunderstandings persist over multiple generations --
    actually cause people to avoid behaviors which result in
    epigenetic changes. Because we can influence our epigenetics and
    the epigentic programs of our children and grandchildren (since
    epigenetic changes usually skip a generation) then it seems the
    [Lamarckian]() ideas behind evolution were far closer than the
    average middle school student is led to believe. This is why it's
    tragic that people believe they are trapped by their DNA! This
    false paradigm is a consequence of general social misunderstanding
    of genetics, but it also robs individuals and social groups of the
    chance to change their collective epigenetic destinies. Belief can
    empower us or it can disempower us.

    Further still: why would you structure your self-conception around
    any limiting beliefs? In the context of intelligence, if genetics
    did so definitely correspond to innate destiny, then why would you
    choose to limit yourself by centering so many beliefs around
    factors of life you didn't choose and you think that you can't
    change? Limiting beliefs like those rob you of the opportunity to
    try to transcend your limitation or to grow stronger by
    struggling. If you struggle through your limitations, you will
    always be stronger for it. Since our limitations are usually the
    result of some weak factors or facets, then by forcing ourselves
    to focus on them, either they are exercised and strengthend or we
    become more aware of them and in tune with them.

    ({restructure this entire paragragh}: Normally, when a person
    believes that an individual or group's genetic background
    determines their fitness in various facets of life, whether its
    sports, academics, or whatever, or otherwise makes assumptions
    based on primarily visual phenotypes -- which to be sure, are in
    fact, completely decoupled from the non-visual phenotypes which
    can't be identified -- then the implications include:)


    - (1) the distortion in how you view the world results in
      misapprehensions that are disconnected from reality. therefore,
      it doesn't even serve the interests of the person who believes
      these things; they are not true.
    - (2) the person's beliefs distort their confidence and
      expectation in others. because of how beliefs about confidence
      affect others, this is (malevolent/negative) in and of
      itself. therefore, the beliefs limit and constrain people's
      lives and development, individually.
    - (3) the person reinforces social beliefs that *collectively*
      constrain those individuals, limiting them access to
      opportunities as a group, etc
      - This third implication is perhaps the worst of all (though
        this list is far from exhaustive) )because it encourages
        people to unconsciously reshape their world so that it *seems*
        to affirm their flawed assumptions stemming from ethnicity,
        sexuality, etc.
      - However, since this is an unconscious implication of such
        toxic limiting beliefs (e.g. racism), it is difficult for
        people to connect their beliefs to the consequences they have
        on the world around them. Thus, in the contexts of such
        consequences, the person can't see how their beliefs mold
        their words/decisions/actions. Thus, they assume their beliefs
        are not responsible for such unconscious implications, if they
        are at all conscious to the consequences.

  - Though epigeneics and early childhood nutrition likely play a
    large part in producing intelligence, the latter can be addressed
    if it is acknowledged (with some money) and the former is far more
    under our control than the term epigenetics might imply. This
    concept relates to how our cells, tissues, the brain and the body
    tune networks of genes in response to our environment.


#### Misc Notes about Non-Linear Speed Reading

- I was unaware of this until Tatiana Maslany asked me whether I had
  ever considered reading in such a counter-intuitive manner.
  - (allegedly ... according to my "memories" as they were and have
    since gradually adapted over time; still, that she asked me about
    this was a memory I recovered within the first few months)
  - she asked me about speed reading, to which i scoffed but presented
    curiosity. goes to show how smart i am: a person's rate of
    information acquisition is bounded by their speed of
    reading. people learn faster through reading than by
    video/audio/etc.
    - furthermore, she also passed me books to have me read. this
      seemed to be a means to buy time (about an hour or so. for this
      and almost 95% of memories recovered after June or September, i
      cannot for the life of me place them into a timeline of the
      weekend. furthermore, the sensory contents of the memories is
      less complete (less visual/audio components, usually mostly
      semantic components) ... SO I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THOSE, WHICH
      NOT ONLY SEEM TO IMPLICATE ME IN ALL KINDS OF NATIONAL SECURITY
      BULLSHIT, BUT ALSO WERE USED TO GASLIGHT ME.
      - which she said "had been checked out of the Denver Library"
      - A Scanner Darkly, the book she asked me to read then
      - A particular printing of Dune
      - and she also showed me the same printing of "The Island of
        Dr. Moreau" of which I read the first few pages. when she
        returned she asked me what I thought of it. I hadn't read
        beyond their ship landing on the isle, but I tried to
        extrapolate the plot anyways (a tendency of mine; to try-hard,
        but moreso for the challenge of filling in blanks without
        adequate information)
        - i quickly segued to talking about
    - The Salem, VA library had the same exact printings of A Scanner
      Darkly and Dune, but a different printing of Doctor Moreau. I
      checked them out before going to Myrtle Beach in late may &
      early june 2015 with my family. during this trip, I first tried
      to tell them the story. my sister tried to disrupt my awkward
      attempts to bring it up in conversation and seemed to have
      whispered to "he's trying to tell you about tatiana", indicating
      that she had knowledge. regardless of what my sister said
      precisely, which is easy to dismiss, she was not making it easy
      for me during the 2 or 3 minutes where I kept trying to talk
      about it. while this was going on, I had my notes open on my
      laptop about these memories I strangely recalled from nowehere.
      - since i've remembered this, it's been so wierd that people
        seem to know about it (since they predicate their
        decisions/actions upon it, or distort their actions based on
        it... that is whatever, since i've had all of less than 15
        minutes of over conversations with any people about those
        "memories"...
        - I only remembered these memories *after* ~2/27/2015, while
          watching Orphan Black and trying to figure out why
          Cosima/Allison seemed familiar. My mom had cut off my
          Comcast internet -- WHILE I WAS INTERVIEWING FOR JOBS FOR
          THE FIRST TIME IN SIX MONTHS, implying ulterior motivation
          - i had to complete these interviews from the skating rink
            and my brothers house.
          - it almost seemed like she didn't want me to watch the show
            Orphan Black, as if she was aware that it would trigger
            recall of these "memories" ... other signals indicate that
            she was aware (mostly after, but somewhat before my "total
            recall")

### Who else know about the recalled memories?

- My manager from Boulder asked me about Tatiana,
  Scientology and once audited me with an E-meter.
  - There was this guy i lived with beside Regis University for all of
    48 hours, which culminated in a "psychotic episode" on 11/4/2013
    (my mother's birthday) where he may have been trying to bash my
    head in with a rock
- He ALSO wrote messages on the wall which (if you add/remove single
  letters from his "psychotic" messages vaguely refer to Orphan Black)
  - He had also asked me whether I remember Tatiana and told me about
    her TV show. When I didn't remember, he became very angry and
    almost instantly descended into meticulous (yet authentic)
    psychosis
    - he had been to a mental institution and just so happened to be
      released when i was recently homeless once again. this may have
      been a cover to falsely prescribe him to high doses of Seroquel,
      prescriptions he filled for the first time since leaving the
      mental institution. he conveniently left his discharge papers
      laying on the floor while he went to the pharmacy -- BUT
      NOT-SO-INCONSPICUOUSLY LEFT A SMALL HAIR AND PIECE OF DIRT ON
      TOP OF THEM. why is this relevant? It indicates that he wanted
      to know whether I would look.
    - this is a tactic that trained thieves, conmen, professional
      liars, and even CIA-trained agents/assets will use as an
      event-driven indication (it's almost exactly James Bond's
      tape-hair-to-a-door-trick: you might as well get a facebook
      notification that says "your new roommate snooped into your
      medical records") needless to say, i placed the hair/dirt
      *exactly* back into place.

      - (also) Bobby Blankenship used the same tactic when planting
        goods his mother would accuse me of stealing at my house.

      - This potential axe-murderer in Colorado (sorry dude, you made
        me fear for my life, though I kept calm) also had a
        prescription bottle under another name of "*-racetams", a
        smart drug WHICH IS RARELY PRESCRIBED BY ANY PHYSICIAN, as it
        is not a controlled medication
        - it would be prescribed by physicians responsible for the
          care of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and high-energy
          millionaires who have the time to find a doctor to prescribe
          FUCKING NOOTROPICS. just take the damn racetams, damn!
          they're **racetams!**
        - this guy also had

### I was gaslighted by *other people* who refered to fragments from my "delusional" memories to gain my trust

- some of these people knew about my memories with Tatiana.
  - whenever Deja Vu occured, bad things were soon to follow (but only
    after my trust was gained and i became submissively compliant --
    WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR **COVERT NLP**)

- more strangely, a handful of people have gaslighted me with images
  from my memories, MOST OF WHICH I NEVER TALKED ABOUT OUTSIDE OF MY
  HOUSE) they would refer to symbol's and images to gain my trust,
  then exploiting it to encourage delusional thinking. their general
  playbook:

  - (1) gain my trust by leveraging symbols from my "memories"
    - and if my memories are mostly delusional, then doing so is
    difficult to explain.

  - (2) develop a rapport and relationship over two or three weeks,
    laying a basis for remaining connected
    - more than twice, this involved metaphors to the "mail" and
      intimations that they were my "attorney" of some kind...
      - whenever this was the case, they implied early on that
        everything we discussed must be referred to in pattern
        language -- "IT MUST HAVE A COVER" ~ paraphrasing my
        "attorneys"

  - (3) Once they had my trust and were connected, they would shovel
    misinformation down my throat
    - it was spiced with references to the contents personal memories,
      details of recent occurances in home/elsewhere, and
      *combinatorially-convluted* foreshadowing of events to come
      within 2-3 weeks
      - this allusion to information related to Tatiana and all the
        crazy bullshit in my life was to keep me hooked by promising
        things they couldn't deliver -- THE INFORMATION THEY LACKED IN
        COMPLETENESS

  - (4) Whenever I tried to elicit information (why or how is this
    happening to me), they would vaguely shame me and dance around
    with *CIRCUMLOCUTION* and *COVERT NLP*
    - Whenever I would try take control of their circumlocation to
      elicit information
    - explanations included vague references to "time travel",
      "optogenetics", and other bullshit that was too conveniently
      aligned with my search history.

  - (5) these people would engage in social games with other people
    (who had the instruction booklets for these cruel social games)
    - e.g. a variant of "good cop, bad cop", where members of a group
      alternate ever 5-15 minutes or so between being the sole "good
      cop" who projects positive energy towards the target.
      - the other members of the group would become dismissive and
        tend to marginalize the target, if they didn't overtly berate
        the target (while depriving the target of an identity, which
        is key)
      - all of these games were conducted knowing that the target has
        no where else to go. these are the only "friends" the target
        is connected to. this is intentional: someone in
        social/financial poverty with few friends is going to be
        attracted towards the short-lived positive energy like a lost,
        ABUSED puppy who hasn't yet lost all hope of life without
        abject, calculated cruelty.
