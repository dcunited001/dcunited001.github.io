All drafts are on my bitbucket. This repository is my nachlass and
every update can be analyzed. Feel free to clone it, fork it,
distribute it or simply try to burn it. Neitzsche's best works were
posthumous, after all. If the government tries to kill me or frame me
(and they've tried both), anticipating more of the same is why my
content is always pre-published on Github. All of these are attempts
to unveil the truth and distribute it as widely as possible. This all
resonates with my own philosophy, which reinforces my works'
aesthetic. There is an MIT license for these reasons. Obviously, I'm
not permitted to accomplish anything in America, so I've just made
everything free as in beer. All information will become omnipresent
anyways; I'm simply living and working as though it already is.

### Noteable Bootstrap/Jekyll/CSS Themes

- [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

## WTF?

Jekyll is a simple and blog-aware static site generator built in Ruby. In laymen terms, it's just a tool to let you have **all the cool features of a full-blown CMS without having to worry about managing a database**. This means hosting is *extremely easy* and *scalable* since all you're doing is managing a bunch of files.

This is just a starter theme!

## Getting Started

To start coding away, first clone this repo...

```
git clone https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-io.github.io my-blog
cd my-blog
```

Then run Jekyll (if you don't have Jekyll installed, see the tutorial or docs):

```
jekyll serve
```

Change `url` in `_data/global.yml` to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

Start coding.
